increase by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing  Date Working
Capital (as determined in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)(ii)_ ) is greater

which the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is less than the Target 
Working Capital, and (B) a decrease by the amount, if any, of the Estimated
Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness. The net amount after giving effect to the
adjustments shall be the " _Closing Purchase Price_."

   

   

(ii) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a statement  setting forth
its good faith estimate of Closing Date Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital_ ") and Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness (the

five (75) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver  to Buchanan Purchaser's written calculations of (i) the Actual
Closing Date Working Capital, (ii) Cash of the Companies as of the Closing

Companies as of the Closing  Date (" _Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness_
"), and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Purchaser that the
calculation of the Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and
Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness  was prepared in accordance with this
Agreement.

   

   

 

18  

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

   

   

(i) No later than forty-five (45) days following delivery of the Purchaser's
written calculation of the Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash and Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness, Buchanan shall notify the
Purchaser in writing whether he accepts or disputes the accuracy of the
calculation of Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing  Date Cash and
Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness. If Buchanan accepts the calculation of
Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date
Remaining Indebtedness determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ , or if 
Buchanan fails within such forty-five (45) day period to notify the Purchaser
of any dispute with respect thereto, then the calculation of Actual Closing
Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Remaining
Indebtedness determined  pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be the " _Final
Working Capital_ ", the calculation of Closing Date Cash determined pursuant
to _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be the " _Final Closing Date Cash_ ", and the
calculation of Closing  Date Remaining Indebtedness determined pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_ shall be the " _Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness_ ",
which, in each case, shall be deemed final and conclusive and binding upon all
Parties in all respects.

   

   

(ii) If Buchanan disputes the accuracy of the calculation of Actual Closing
Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash or Closing Date Remaining 
Indebtedness, Buchanan shall provide written notice to the Purchaser no later
than forty-five (45) days following the delivery by the Purchaser to Buchanan
of the calculation of Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash
and Closing  Date Remaining Indebtedness (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), setting
forth in reasonable detail those items that Buchanan disputes, the amounts of
any adjustments that are necessary in Buchanan's judgment for the computations
of the Actual  Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Date Remaining Indebtedness to conform to the requirements of this Agreement,
and the basis for Buchanan's suggested adjustments. During the thirty (30) day
period following delivery  of a Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and Buchanan
shall meet and negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving their
disagreements over the disputed items. Until the final determination of Final
Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and Closing  Date Remaining Indebtedness,
Buchanan and its respective agents shall be provided with such access to the
financial books and records of the Companies as they may reasonably request to
enable them to review Purchaser's calculations of the  Actual Closing Date
Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness,
and to review and address any issues related to the matters described in any
Dispute Notice. If the Parties resolve their differences over the  disputed
items in accordance with the foregoing procedure, " _Final Working Capital_ ",
" _Final Closing Date Cash_ " and " _Final Closing Date Remaining
Indebtedness_ " shall be the amounts agreed upon by them. If the Parties fail
to  resolve their differences over the disputed items within such thirty (30)
day period, then the Purchaser and/or Buchanan shall request that a mutually
agreeable independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") (who
shall be  deemed to have been engaged jointly by Buchanan and the Purchaser)
make a binding determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement.

   

   

 

19  

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will, under the terms of its engagement, have
a reasonable time not to exceed ninety (90) days unless the  Parties agree in
writing to extend the same, from the date of referral within which to render
its written decision with respect to the disputed items (and only with respect
to any unresolved disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and  the
final calculation of Actual Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash
and Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness based solely on the resolution of such
disputed items. The Purchaser and Buchanan shall submit their respective
final  information and testimony when requested by the Accounting Arbitrator
who shall render its decision expeditiously. The Accounting Arbitrator shall
review such submissions and base its determination solely on such submissions.
In resolving any  disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the least value for such item claimed by either
Party. The decision of the  Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final and
binding upon the Parties and enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction and the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of (i) Actual
Closing Date Working Capital shall be deemed the " _Final      Working
Capital_.", (ii) Closing Date Cash shall be deemed the " _Final Closing Date
Cash_ ", and (iii) Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness shall be deeded the "
_Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness_ ". The fees and expenses of  the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Buchanan, on the other, proportionate to the determination of the Accounting
Arbitrator on the disputed items.

   

   

(d) _Payment Following Calculation of Final Working Capital, Closing Date Cash
and Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness_.

   

   

(i) Following the determination of the Final Working Capital, Final Closing
Date Cash and Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness, the  Purchase Price
shall be recalculated and adjusted as follows:

   

   

(A) If the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital, then the Purchase Price will be reduced by the  amount of
such deficiency, and Buchanan shall deliver to the Purchaser cash in the
amount of such deficiency. If the Final Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, then the Purchase Price will be
increased by  the amount of such excess, and the Purchaser shall deliver to
Buchanan cash in the amount of such excess.

   

   

 

20  

(B) If Final Closing Date Cash is greater than $0.00, then the Purchase Price
will be increased by the amount of such excess, and the  Purchaser shall
deliver to Buchanan cash in the amount of such excess.

   

   

(C) If Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness, then the Purchase Price  will be
increased by the amount of such deficiency, and the Purchaser shall deliver to
Buchanan cash in the amount of such deficiency. If Final Closing Date
Remaining Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Remaining 
Indebtedness, then the Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount of such
excess, and Buchanan shall deliver to the Purchaser cash in the amount of such
excess.

   

   

(ii) The Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , shall be
referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_ ".  All payments pursuant
to this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be made by wire transfer in immediately
available United States funds, and shall be made within three (3) Business
Days following: (A) the forty-five (45)-day period following the  Purchaser's
delivery of the calculation of the Actual Closing Date Working Capital,
Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)_ if Buchanan does not timely dispute such amounts pursuant to
_Section      2.4(c)(i)_ ; (B) the date of Buchanan's and the Purchaser's
mutual determination of Final Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash and
Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness in the event Buchanan timely
disputes any amounts pursuant to _Section      2.4(c)(ii)_ and Buchanan's
and the Purchaser's differences are resolved without the engagement of an
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_ ; or (C) the date of
the Accounting Arbitrator's determination of Final  Working Capital, Final
Closing Date Cash and Final Closing Date Remaining Indebtedness pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)(iii)_ in the event Buchanan timely disputes any amounts
pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_ and Buchanan and the  Purchaser are unable
to resolve their differences pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_.

   

   

(iii) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be deemed an adjustment to  the Purchase
Price.

   

   

(e) _Accounting Procedures_. The determination of Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital, the Actual Closing Date Working  Capital, and Final Working
Capital shall be calculated consistent with the methodology and illustrative
example provided in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto.

   

   

 

21

Note and the Captive Promissory Note shall be held and released by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to both _Section      2.5(e)_ below and the Fuel Supply
and Captive Escrow Agreement. The Fuel Supply Amount, or the remaining balance
thereof, shall be released to the Seller the last day of the twelfth month
after the Closing Date unless there are unresolved  claims outstanding at
such time, in which event the amount in dispute shall remain in place until
all such claims are resolved; provided, however, that during such twelve (12)
month period, and promptly following the respective dates that  Seller's
obligations under _Section 6.9_ with respect to each respective Fuel Supply
Contract have been finally determined, Purchaser and Seller shall direct the
Escrow Agent to release to Seller the amount equal to (i) the respective 
portion of the Fuel Supply Amount attributed to such Fuel Supply Contract,
less (ii) the portion, if any, of the Fuel Supply Amount paid pursuant to

to _Section 9.1_   and _Section 9.9_. The Indemnity Escrow Promissory Note

2.5(e)_ below and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. Unless released pursuant to
_Section 2.5(f)_ ,  the Indemnity Escrow Amount, or the remaining balance
thereof, shall be released to the Seller the last day of the fifteenth month

or.

Extension Under Letter of Credit No. _______, the  Seller\'s/Applicant\'s

(iii) require issuer to provide at least 120 days' notice to Purchaser of any
expiration or non-renewal and allow Purchaser to draw the full  amount
available under the letter of credit if notice is given by the issuer that
such letter of credit will not be renewed after the initial or any extended
expiration date. Seller and Buchanan acknowledge and agree that Purchaser
shall be  entitled to draw the full amount of the letter of credit upon its
receipt of such notice, provided such amount is deposited to escrow as
described in (g) below.

   

   

(g) If the Purchaser draws under the letter of credit upon notice of non-
renewal by the issuer, the amount of such draw shall be deposited to an escrow
account  previously established with the Escrow Agent under the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, and such amount shall thereafter be held and released by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of such escrow agreement.

   

   

(h) If there are no claims made under the letter of credit prior to the last
day of the fifteenth month after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cooperate
with  Seller to cause cancellation of the letter of credit. If there are
unresolved claims under the letter of credit at the end of the fifteen (15)

with Seller to obtain an amended or replacement letter of credit in reduced
face amount sufficient to satisfy such claim, including any related fees or
expenses.

(a) Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.
Purchaser will execute and deliver to Seller such documents as  Seller may
reasonably request in order to confirm the accuracy of the foregoing.

distribute all or any part of the equity of the Companies, except as permitted
by law, including securities laws.

 

 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the interests comprising the equity
of the Companies are characterized as "restricted securities" under the
securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from  Seller in a
transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and
applicable regulations the equity of the Companies may be resold without
registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances.
In this  respect, Purchaser represents that it is familiar with Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, as presently in effect, and understands
the resale limitations imposed thereby and otherwise by the Securities Act.

 

 

(c) Purchaser has had the opportunity to ask questions of Seller and its
representatives and to obtain information from such representatives as
necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of acquiring the equity  of the
Companies and no representations concerning such matters or any other matters
related to such investment have been made to the Purchaser except as set forth
in this Agreement. Purchaser has consulted its own attorney, accountant or
investment  advisor with respect to the investment contemplated hereby and
its suitability for the Purchaser, including the tax and other economic
considerations related to the investment.

 

 

(d) Purchaser: (i) understands and acknowledges that the Purchaser's
investment in the equity of the Companies involves a high degree of risk; (ii)
has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters  such that the
Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the acquisition of
the equity of the Companies as contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is
able to bear the economic risk of the investment in the equity of the
Companies  for an indefinite period of time and can afford to suffer a
complete loss of the investment in the equity of the Companies.

compensation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

of indebtedness, payments of amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of such transactions and payments of all related fees and
expenses), Purchaser  will be Solvent. Purchaser is not incurring any
obligation or taking any other action in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of Purchaser.

 

 

5.8 _Independent Investigation_. In  making the decision to enter into this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than reliance on the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations of the Companies, the  Seller's
Shareholders and Seller set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser has relied
solely on its own independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the
Companies (including Purchaser's own estimate and appraisal of the value of
the financial  condition, assets, operations and prospects of the Companies).
Purchaser confirms to Seller and the Seller's Shareholders that Purchaser is
sophisticated and knowledgeable in the business of the Companies and is
capable of evaluating the matters set  forth above. PURCHASER FURTHER

Purchaser of any development occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date of which Seller obtains Knowledge that  reasonably could be
expected to cause any of the representations and warranties in _Articles 3_ or
_4_ to be inaccurate as of the date deemed given or the Closing Date. The

agrees that the Seller, Seller's Shareholders and the Companies shall not have
any liability to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to

faith consideration of the views of, the other Parties, an appropriate
response in substantial compliance with such request.

 

 

(c) In addition to and without limiting any of the other covenants of the
Parties contained in this _Section 6.5_ , the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to (i) prepare and make any appropriate  filings under the HSR
Act as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in

Agreement), (ii) substantially comply, at the earliest practicable date,
with  any request for additional information or documentary material received
by them, or any of their respective Affiliates from the Federal Trade

(" _DOJ_ ") pursuant to  the HSR Act or from any state attorney general or
other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) cooperate with and assist each
other in connection with any filing under the  HSR Act and in connection with
attempting to resolve any antitrust investigation or other inquiry concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby commenced by the FTC, the DOJ, any state

resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust law so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (v) advise the other
Parties promptly  of any communication received by such Party from the FTC,
the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to
applicable law, permit the other Parties to  review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed
communication to the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated  hereby. In
addition, no Party shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with, submit any materials to or take any material substantive
position with the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental  Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or another
inquiry regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, or enter into any
agreements with the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority, including,  without limitation, extending any
antitrust waiting periods, unless it consults with, and considers in good
faith the views of, the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted
by the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other  Governmental
Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate.
Each party shall furnish counsel to the other Parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them and their Affiliates
and  representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of their staffs, on the other hand, regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser  shall, on behalf of the Parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy relating to any inquiry by
any Governmental Authority and lead the process to obtain any necessary
approval, consents, waivers, authorizations, and other confirmations  from
any Governmental Authority, subject to good faith consultations with the
Company.

 

 

 

51  

(d) Each Party will use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act as
promptly as practicable with respect to the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement and in any event prior to the Expiration Date. Each Party will
use reasonable best efforts to resolve any inquiry or objections as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority under the Antitrust Laws with respect
to  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Concurrently with the
filing of notifications under the HSR Act or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the Parties shall each request early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR  Act. In addition to and without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree that if any Governmental Authority
objects to or prohibits the closing of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, the Parties shall  work together in
good faith and with reasonable best efforts to agree upon a mutually
acceptable solution to the objection or prohibition. If, after ten days
following formal receipt of such an objection or prohibition by any
Governmental Authority  and no mutually acceptable solution can be agreed
upon, the Parties may terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, no
Party may terminate this Agreement under the above provision if the
Governmental Authority will permit the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement upon the exclusion from these transactions and the separate sale of
ten or less stores identified by the Governmental Authority. The Parties shall
cooperate to sell the identified stores and, subject to the occurrence  of
Closing under this Agreement, provide Purchaser the proceeds from such
sale(s). Within two Business Days after the closing of the sale of the
identified stores, Buchanan shall pay to Purchaser one half of (i) the product
of the total number of  stores required to be sold minus five, multiplied by
(ii) the average store price differential, calculated as the amount by which
(A) the trailing twelve months EBITDA for all stores required to be sold,
multiplied by the multiple of EBITDA paid by  Purchaser in this transaction,
exceeds (B) the total proceeds received by Purchaser for the sale(s) of all
such identified stores required to be sold, divided by (C) the number of
stores required to be sold. The Purchase Price shall not otherwise be 
reduced.

 

 

As a further inducement for the Seller to enter into this Agreement, the
Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will not, either directly or
indirectly, affiliate in any manner with any third party to fund, consummate 
or participate in any manner with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that could adversely impact the ability to obtain consents from any
Governmental Authority without the express written consent of the Seller. The
Purchaser  acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall under no circumstances
be obligated to so consent and the Seller may reasonably withhold its consent
in its sole and complete discretion. The Purchaser shall advise the Seller in
writing of the identity and  scope of participation of each such third party
within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof. The Seller shall advise the
Purchaser of the grant or withholding of consent within two (2) Business Days
of receipt of the complete information with  respect to such third party as
described above. In the event the Purchaser or its Affiliates intends to
provide or share any Confidential Information of the Seller or the Companies
to or with any third party prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser  shall
cause such third party, as a condition precedent to receiving such
information, to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Seller in form
and substance substantially the same as the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

 

52

will take any action to (a) solicit, initiate, encourage,  facilitate or
continue inquiries or the submission of any Acquisition Proposal , (b) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any
information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any
other  manner any effort or attempt by any Person concerning a possible

immediately cease and cause to  be terminated, and shall cause its
Affiliates, including the Companies, to immediately cease and cause to be

recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination transaction
involving the  Companies; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Companies; or (iii) the sale,
lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of the
Companies' properties or assets; but  excluding in all events the
Restructuring.

 

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.6_ , the Seller
shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt
thereof by the Seller) advise the Purchaser orally  and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably
be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and 
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person making the same.

 

 

(c) Seller and the Seller's Shareholders agree that the rights and remedies
for noncompliance with this _Section 6.6_ shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity  jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to the Purchaser and that money damages would not provide
an adequate remedy to the Purchaser. If the Purchaser successfully  enforces
any rights and remedies for noncompliance with this _Section 6.6_ , the
Purchaser shall also have the right to recover reasonable attorneys' fees from
the Seller.

 

 

6.7 _Affiliated Transactions_. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 6.7_ of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Companies, Seller and the Seller's Shareholders will
cause all  Contracts and transactions by and between Seller, any Seller's
Shareholder and any Affiliate of Seller or the Seller's Shareholders (other
than the Companies), on the one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, to
be terminated effective as of  the Closing, without any cost or continuing
obligation to the Companies, Seller or the Seller's Shareholders or their
Affiliates, and will deliver to the Purchaser evidence of such terminations
that is reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser.

 

 

 

53  

6.8 _Guarantees_. Prior to Closing, Buchanan, the Seller and the Seller's
Shareholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain releases 
from all letters of credit, bonds, security deposits, financial assurances,
guarantees and other surety obligations or Liabilities for all such
arrangements given by Buchanan, Seller, the Seller's Shareholders or their
Affiliates (other than the  Companies) for the benefit of the Companies or
the Business (each a " _Credit Support Arrangement_ "), including those set
forth on Schedule II attached hereto. The Purchaser shall cooperate with
Buchanan, Seller and Seller's Shareholders in  connection therewith,
including providing information and assurances as to compliance with existing
agreements to assist in obtaining such releases. Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold Seller, Buchanan and the other Seller's Shareholders harmless  from and
against any and all Losses resulting from the failure of the Companies or
their successors to comply, after the Closing Date, with any written agreement
that is the subject of any Credit Support Arrangement which has not been
released in  full without continuing liability to Seller, Buchanan and the
other Seller's Shareholders.

 

 

6.9 _Motor Fuel Supply Contracts_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the
Companies to continue any and all contracts pursuant to which the Companies
and/or any dealers are  supplied motor fuel for resale (the " _Fuel Supply
Contracts_ "). Unless Purchaser, within the sixty (60) day period immediately
following Closing, notifies in writing the supplier under such Fuel Supply
Contract, with copy to Seller and Seller's  Shareholders, of termination of
such Fuel Supply Contract, Seller and Seller's Shareholders shall have no
Liability under such Fuel Supply Contracts following the Closing. In the event

6.10 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof and prior to termination of
this Agreement, the Seller shall, and shall cause the  Companies to, (a)
afford the Purchaser and its Representatives full and free access to and the
right to inspect all of the Company Real Property, properties, assets,
premises, books and records, Contracts and other documents and data related to
the  Companies; (b) furnish the Purchaser and its Representatives with such
financial, operating and other data and information related to the Companies
as the Purchaser or any of its Representatives may reasonably request; and (c)
instruct the  Representatives of the Seller and the Purchaser to cooperate
with the Purchaser in their investigation of the Companies; provided, however,
that such access and inspection right shall exclude any invasive environmental
testing, including the  collecting and analysis of samples of indoor or
outdoor air, surface water, groundwater or surface or subsurface land on, at,
in, under or from the Companies and the Company Real Property. Purchaser shall
provide at least two (2) days advance  written notice to Seller and the
Seller's Shareholders indicating what access it desires. Any investigation
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ shall be conducted during normal business
hours and in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably  with the conduct
of the business of the Seller, the Seller's Shareholders or the Companies. No
investigation by the Purchaser or other information received by the Purchaser
shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty 
or agreement given or made by the Seller in this Agreement. Purchaser and its
Representatives will comply with all Data Protection Requirements and the
Confidentiality Agreements.

 

 

6.11 _Data Privacy_. Each of the Companies (a) will comply in all material
respects with Data Protection Requirements applicable to the  operations of
its business, (b) will maintain all material rights and permissions
commercially reasonable and necessary to lawfully use Personal Data in
accordance with Data Protection Requirements, and (c) will maintain a

of each of the Companies.

 

 

6.12 _Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Seller's
Shareholders shall take the actions set forth on _Schedule 6.12_ of the
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Restructuring_ ")        as are reasonably
necessary to implement the structure set forth on _Schedule 6.12_ of the
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Closing Structure_ "). The Seller and the
Seller's Shareholders shall be entitled to modify or amend the Closing 
Structure only with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Seller and the
Seller's Shareholders shall provide the Purchaser an opportunity to review any
agreements,  resolutions, formation documents and other instruments that are
prepared to effectuate the Restructuring and shall consider in good faith any
comments the Purchaser may have thereon.

 

 

6.13 _Captive Insurance Commitments_. The Business participates in a captive
insurance and reinsurance program providing the coverage listed on _Schedule
6.13_. Purchaser  intends to terminate that coverage immediately following
the Closing without prejudice to coverage for pre-Closing occurrences. As that
coverage is all provided on an "occurrence" basis, Seller and Buchanan commit
to make available to the Companies,  at no cost to the Companies, continuing
coverage for a four year period following Closing for those claims noted on
Schedule 3.12(b) and for each additional covered claim that may be made for
occurrences prior to Closing. As a part of that captive  insurance and
reinsurance program, Buck's Inc. owns common shares issued by Federated
Limited (the " _Common Share Interest_ "). Seller and Buchanan shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to get the consents and approvals necessary to
transfer  the Common Share Interest from Buck's Inc. to a person or entity
that is not affiliated with any of the Companies after the Closing. Following
the Closing, and until the fourth anniversary of the Closing, Seller and
Buchanan shall deliver to  Purchaser, as and when received under the captive
insurance program, but no less frequently than quarterly (to the extent
available), reports from the insurers or administrators that describe, to the
extent available in such report, for each claim  that was open at any time
during the period, a description of the claim, any action during the period
relating to such claim, the amount reserved for such claim, and the status of
any litigation related to such claim. Seller and Buchanan indemnify  and
agree to hold the Companies harmless from: (i) any payment that is demanded by
any sponsor or other participant in the captive insurance program, or (ii) any
failure by the captive insurance program to provide the four years of
continuing  coverage described above. The Purchaser and the Companies shall
fully cooperate in the investigation and defense of all related claims.
Purchaser and the Companies shall provide such support in furtherance of such
investigations and defense as  reasonably requested by Seller and Buchanan
and such related authorizations and powers of attorney as is determined in
good faith to be mutually acceptable to Purchaser, Seller, and Buchanan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Seller and  Buchanan make no
representation, warranty, covenant, or indemnity that a claim will be covered
to the extent Purchaser or the Companies do not comply with their obligations
in this _Section 6.13_ as to such claim.

 

 

 

55  

6.14 _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the
Companies shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide
cooperation and financial information relating to the Companies in  each case
only to the extent reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with
obtaining any financing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Financing_ "). The commitment of Seller and the Companies under this _Section
6.14_   shall impose no cost, expense or liability on or to Seller, the
Companies or the Seller's Shareholders beyond the cost, expense and liability
of Purchaser's now pending due diligence beyond customary practice for
financings similar to the Financing,  and shall in no event expand the scope
of Purchaser's now pending due diligence and shall in no event impact or delay
the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which the
parties anticipate to be in calendar year 2020. Purchaser  shall cause any
third party who may receive or review any confidential information of the
Companies to agree to keep such information confidential on terms customary
for financings which are similar to the Financing. Any restrictions on
Purchaser's  access to information shall apply mutatis mutandis to any such
third parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.14_
or otherwise, in no event shall the receipt or availability  of any funds or
financing (including without limitation the Financing) by or to the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to
any of the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement.

indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_ must give the Seller and
Buchanan or the Purchaser, as the case may be, written notice of such claim
describing such claim and the nature and amount of such Loss, to the extent 
that the nature and amount thereof are determinable at such time (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") promptly after the indemnified party receives any written notice of
any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "
_Proceeding_ ")  against or involving the indemnified party by a third party
or otherwise discovers the Liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such
claim for indemnification; provided, however, that the failure  to notify or
delay in notifying the Seller and Buchanan or the Purchaser, as the case may
be, will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_ , except and only to the extent that  rights or
defenses of the indemnifying party are forfeited or impaired by reason of such
failure. Following receipt of a Claim Notice, the Parties shall for a period

agreement  with respect to the Claim Notice. If no such agreement is reached,
the claiming Party shall be entitled to pursue the remedies available to it
under the law and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including
_Section 10.10_. 
 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. After receipt of a Claim Notice 
relating to a third party claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled, if
it so elects by written notice to the indemnified party within thirty (30)
days following the indemnifying party's receipt of a Claim Notice, (A) to take
control of  the defense and investigation of such third party claim and (B)
to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice that are reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party to handle and defend the same if the
indemnifying party acknowledges its  obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party for any Losses resulting from such claim. The indemnified party shall,
with respect to any third party claim, promptly deliver to the indemnifying
party, but in any event within twenty (20)  Business Days after the
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices, court papers and
material correspondence received by the indemnified party relating to the
third party claim. The indemnified party shall provide, at the  indemnifying
party's cost and expense, such information and documentation that is not
subject to the attorney-client privilege or other applicable privilege or
under court seal as the indemnifying party may reasonably request in order
to  evaluate its indemnification obligations hereunder in order to determine
whether to assume the defense of such third party claim. If the indemnifying
party chooses to defend any third party claim, all the Parties hereto shall
reasonably  cooperate in the defense or prosecution of each third party claim
at the indemnifying party's cost and expense (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement). Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the indemnifying  party's request) the provision to the other of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such third party
claim, and making relevant employees available on a mutually convenient basis.

 

 


 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

(iii) _Control of Defense; Exceptions, etc._ The indemnified party will be 
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own expense; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the  indemnifying party shall bear the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel incurred prior to the date upon
which the indemnifying party effectively assumes control of such defense. If
the indemnifying party fails to timely notify the  indemnified party that the
indemnifying party elects to defend the indemnified party pursuant to the
preceding paragraph, or if the indemnifying party elects to defend the
indemnified party but fails to reasonably prosecute or settle the claim  as
herein provided or if the indemnified party reasonably objects to such
election on the grounds that counsel for such indemnifying party cannot
represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party because such
representation would  be reasonably likely to result in a conflict of
interest, then the indemnified party shall have the right to defend, at the
sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party (to the extent indemnifiable
pursuant to this _Article 9_ ), the  claim by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings shall be promptly and reasonably prosecuted by the
indemnified party to a final conclusion or settled. In such a situation, the
indemnified party shall have full control of such defense  and proceedings
and the indemnifying party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the indemnified party pursuant to this _Section
9.1(c)(iii)_ , and the indemnifying party shall bear its own costs and 
expenses with respect to such participation. Whether or not the indemnifying
party shall have assumed the defense of a third party claim, no indemnified
party shall admit any liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any
judgment, or  settle, compromise or discharge, any third party claim without
the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that the
indemnified party will not be  required to obtain any consent of the
indemnifying party to any such admission, consent, settlement, compromise or
discharge of such claim (and will not prejudice its right to be indemnified
with respect to such claim) if the indemnifying party  is disputing its
obligation or is asserting that it has no obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party in respect of such claim. Upon conclusion of the
proceedings, the indemnified Party shall be entitled to prompt payment for its
determined  Losses (subject to the terms of this Agreement).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) _Settlement of Claims_. The indemnifying party must obtain the prior 
written consent of the indemnified party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to entering into any settlement of any
claim or Proceeding or ceasing to defend any claim or Proceeding unless the
proposed  settlement involves only the payment of money damages and does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief on the indemnified party.

 

 


 

 

 

 

65  

(d) _Investigation of the Companies_. Any knowledge of the Purchaser or its
representatives prior to Closing, and the delivery by the Seller or the
Seller's Shareholders of any document, waiver or other  instrument or written
communication hereunder (including the Updated Schedules which will indicate
new information), shall diminish, obviate and cure any breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Companies  (other
than post-Closing representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Companies), Seller's Shareholders and/or the Seller that are contained in this
Agreement or any other documents contemplated hereby.

(i) Any payment due pursuant to a Purchaser claim for indemnification with
respect to: (A) _Section 6.9_ of this Agreement shall first be made by the

Seller's failure to transfer from the Companies the Common Share Interest
shall first be made by the Escrow Agent from the Captive Escrow Amount, each
pursuant to the Fuel  Supply and Captive Escrow Agreement as mutually agreed
by Purchaser and Buchanan or not later than thirty (30) days after the amount

(ii) Any payment due pursuant to a Purchaser claim for indemnification with
respect to _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.9_ of this Agreement shall first be
made  by the Escrow Agent from the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement or, to the extent a letter of credit has been
substituted pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_ , by draw under such letter of
credit, as mutually agreed  by Purchaser and Buchanan or not later than
thirty (30) days after the amount of the claim is finally determined as
provided in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement; provided that a draw under such
letter of credit shall not occur unless the amount as  mutually agreed
remains unpaid three (3) days after agreement is reached as to such amount. To
the extent the amount owed by Buchanan pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.9_ exceeds the Indemnity Escrow Amount, Buchanan shall  satisfy its
obligations within thirty (30) days after the amount of the claim is finally
determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Purchaser shall satisfy its obligations with respect to a Seller

66  

(f) _Indemnification Payments as Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payments made
by the Purchaser to the Seller under this _Section 9.1_ shall be considered an
increase to the Purchase Price. Any  payments made by the Seller or Buchanan
or by the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Seller or Buchanan to the Purchaser
under _Section 6.9_ , this _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.9_ shall be considered
a reduction to the Purchase Price.

 

 

(g) _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the indemnification provisions in _Section 6.9_ , this
_Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.9_ shall be  the exclusive remedy of the Parties
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
fraud and except that any Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief
that does not involve the payment of money for any breach or  threatened
breach of a covenant or agreement under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. After the Closing Date, no Party may seek the rescission
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(h) _Calculation of Losses_.

 

 

 

 

(i) The amount of any Losses payable under _Section 6.9_ , this _Section 9.1_
or _Section 9.9_ by the indemnifying party shall be net of any (i)  amounts
recovered by the indemnified party or its Affiliates under applicable
insurance policies, including any captive insurance program of Seller, or from
any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit
actually  realized by the indemnified party or its Affiliates (in the form of
an increase in cash refunds received or as a reduction in Taxes otherwise due)
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. If the indemnified
party (i) receives any  amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from
any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Loss, then such indemnified
party shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying party for any payment made or
out-of-pocket expense incurred by  such indemnifying party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
indemnified party, net of any expenses incurred by such indemnified party in
collecting such amount, or (ii) actually realizes or  receives any net Tax
benefit in the year the Loss were incurred (or in the immediately succeeding
year) that was not initially included in the calculation of Loss, then such
indemnified party shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party the  amount of
such net Tax benefit, net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
indemnified party in collecting such amount.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Seller and Buchanan shall not be liable under _Section 6.9_ , this
_Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.9_ for any (A) Loss relating to any matter to
the  extent that (1) the Purchaser Indemnitees had otherwise been compensated
for such matter pursuant to the calculation of Final Working Capital, the
adjustment of the Purchase Price under _Section 2.2(a)_ or _2.4_ or any
other  provisions of this Agreement, or (2) such Losses are caused by or
result from any action that Seller or any Seller's Shareholder is requested to
take by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or for which Purchaser or its
Affiliates provide consent,  (B) consequential, incidental, indirect,
special, or other similar Losses, except to the extent such Losses are finally
awarded to be payable to a third party by a court of competent jurisdiction,
(C) exemplary, punitive, opportunity cost, or  other similar Losses, (D)
Losses for lost profits or diminution in value, (E) Losses based on any

67  

 

 

(iii) Each indemnified party must mitigate in accordance with Legal
Requirements any Losses for which such indemnified party seeks indemnification
under this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) Each indemnified party and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts
to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to  be responsible, for any Losses payable under _Section 6.9_
, this _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.9_ and the indemnifying party shall be
deemed subrogated to all such rights of the indemnified party; provided that
such obligations  and subrogation shall, to the extent waiver of subrogation
is permitted by the underlying policies, not provide for or allow claims
against Seller, Buchanan or the other Seller's Shareholders with respect to
claims relating to Environmental  Liabilities and the matters set forth in
_Section 9.13_ hereof.

 


 

 

 

 

(i) _Environmental Matters_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 9_ and any other term of this Agreement of otherwise, the Seller,
Buchanan and the other Seller's Shareholders  shall have no indemnity or
other obligation under this Agreement or otherwise for any Environmental
Liabilities except for any breach of a representation or warranty in _Section
3.14_. Subject to any claim for breach of _Section 3.14_ ,  all Environmental
Liabilities shall be retained by the Companies and Purchaser.

 

 

9.2 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each 
Party will take such further action (including, the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may
request, all at the requesting Party's sole cost and expense (unless the
requesting Party is  entitled to indemnification therefor under this _Article
9_ ). The Seller acknowledges and agrees that after the Closing the Purchaser
will be entitled to possession of all of the Companies' documents, books,
records, agreements and financial  data of any sort relating to the Companies
or the Business.

 

 

 

68  

9.3 _Confidentiality; Press Release_.

 

 

(a) The Seller and each of Seller's Shareholders will treat and hold as
confidential all of the Confidential Information of the Purchaser and the
Companies, refrain from using any of such Confidential  Information except in
connection with this Agreement or the performance of the Seller's or such
Seller's Shareholder's duties as an employee, consultant or independent
contractor of the Companies, and deliver promptly to Purchaser or the
Companies or  destroy, at the request and option of the Purchaser, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of such Confidential Information which
are in the Seller's or Seller's Shareholder's possession. If the Seller or
Seller's Shareholder is requested or  required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal action) to disclose any Confidential
Information of the Purchaser or the Companies, the Seller or the Seller's
Shareholder will notify the Purchaser promptly of the  request or requirement
so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective Order or waive
compliance with this _Section 9.3_. If, in the absence of a protective Order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Seller or Seller's  Shareholder is,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any such Confidential
Information to any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator or else
stand liable for contempt, the Seller or Seller's Shareholder may disclose
the  Confidential Information to the Governmental Authority, arbitrator or
mediator; provided, however, that the Seller or Seller's Shareholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of the Purchaser and
at the Purchaser's  expense, an Order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed as the Purchaser shall designate.

 

 

(b) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, but without
expiration in the event this Agreement is terminated, the Purchaser will treat
and hold as confidential all of the Confidential Information  of the Seller
and the Companies, refrain from using any of such Confidential Information and
deliver promptly to the Seller or the Companies or destroy, at the request and
option of the Seller, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of such 
Confidential Information which are in the Purchaser's possession. If the
Purchaser is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal action) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Purchaser will  notify the Seller and the Companies promptly
of the request or requirement so that the Seller or the Companies may seek an
appropriate protective Order or waive compliance with this _Section 9.3_. If,
in the absence of a protective Order or  the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
the Purchaser is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any such
Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator
or else stand liable for contempt, the Purchaser may disclose  the
Confidential Information to the Governmental Authority, arbitrator or
mediator; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of the Seller or the Companies
and at the Seller's or  Companies' expense, as applicable, an Order or other
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the Seller or the
Companies shall designate.

 

 

(c) Except as required pursuant to a Legal Requirement, no Party to this
Agreement shall issue any press release or other public document or make any
public statement relating to this Agreement or the matters  contained herein
without obtaining the prior approval of the other Party.

 

 

9.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall be solely responsible for and shall bear all of its own costs
and expenses incident to  its obligations under and in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited
to, any such costs and expenses incurred by any Party in connection with the
negotiation, preparation and performance of and  compliance with the terms of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, investment bankers or other representatives and
consultants), regardless of whether the transactions contemplated hereby  are
consummated.

 

 

 

69  

9.5 _Transition_. Each of Seller's Shareholders will refer all customer
inquiries relating to the Business to the Companies and/or the Purchaser
from  and after the Closing.

 

 

9.6 _Transfer Taxes; Recording Charges_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Parties shall pay their own transfer, documentary, 
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement when due and the Parties will, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable law, the
Seller (upon the Seller's consent, which  shall not be unreasonably withheld)
will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

 

9.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement  is
not performed in accordance with their specific wording or is otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or  injunctions to prevent such breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition
to any other remedy to which any  Party may be entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

9.8 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buchanan hereby acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement if Buchanan
had not executed and delivered this Agreement to the  Purchaser containing
this _Section 9.8_ ; (ii) Buchanan has had access to information that is
confidential to the Purchaser and the Companies that constitutes a valuable,
special and unique asset of the Purchaser and the Companies, and with 
respect to which the Purchaser is entitled to the protections afforded by this
Agreement and to the remedies for enforcement of this Agreement provided by
law or in equity (including, without limitation, those remedies the
availability of which may  be within the discretion of the court or
arbitrator that presides over any action for enforcement of this Agreement is
brought); and (iii) Buchanan recognizes that the goodwill of the Companies'
business affects the value of the Seller Equity and  that the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 9.8_ are necessary and required to protect the
Confidential Information and Seller Equity.

 

 

(b) Except with respect to any ownership interest in, or other relationship
with, Purchaser or the Companies, from and after the Closing Date, for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, Buchanan  agrees that
he will not (directly or indirectly through any entity or other Person), and
shall cause each of his, he or its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
acting alone or as a member of a partnership, as a holder or owner of any
security,  as an employee, agent, advisor, consultant to, independent
contractor to, representative or in any of the states listed on _Exhibit C_
hereto (collectively, the " _Territory_ "):

 

 

 

70  

 

 

(i) Carry on or be engaged in or otherwise take part in (whether for his/its
own account or for the account of any other Person, other than the Purchaser
or its  Affiliates) any business which competes with the Business in the
Territory; provided, however, that the definition of " _Competitive Business_
" and the restrictions of this _Section 9.8_ shall  not apply to the supply
of motor fuel or gasoline products to terminals which are located in or
otherwise supply such motor fuel or gasoline products to the Territory ("
_Competitive Business_ ");

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Share in the earnings of, or beneficially own or hold any security issued
by or any other economic interest in, or otherwise own or hold any interest
in, any Person  who or which is directly or indirectly engaged in a
Competitive Business in the Territory;

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Request or suggest, directly or indirectly, that any customer or vendor
of the Companies as of the Closing Date, or that has been a customer or vendor
of the  Companies within two (2) years before the Closing Date, curtail or
cancel its business or refrain from doing business with the Companies in the
Territory; or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) Solicit or provide services in the Territory as a Competitive Business to
the services of the Companies as performed as of the Closing Date to, for, or
on behalf of,  directly or indirectly, any customer of the Companies as of
the Closing Date, or that has been a customer of the Companies within two (2)
years before the Closing Date.

 


 

 

 

 

(c) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Buchanan agrees
that he will not (directly or indirectly through any entity or other Person),
and shall cause each of his Affiliates not to,  directly or indirectly,
acting alone or as a member of a partnership, as a holder or owner of any
security, as an employee, agent, advisor, consultant to, representative, or in
any other capacity:

 

 

 

 

(i) Contact, solicit or enter into any agreement or contract with any employee
of the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies other than Steven Buchanan
or Nichole  Mallett;

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Directly or indirectly solicit the employment or services of, or cause or
attempt to cause to leave the employment or service of the Companies or any
Affiliate of  Companies, any Person who or which is employed by, or otherwise
engaged to perform services for, the Companies or any Affiliate of the
Companies (whether in the capacity of employee, consultant, independent
contractor or otherwise) other than  Steven Buchanan or Nichole Mallett; or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Request that any present or future employee, agent or independent
contractor of the Companies, or any Affiliate of the Companies, curtail or
cancel its business or  refrain from doing business with the Companies or any
Affiliate of the Companies other than Steven Buchanan or Nichole Mallett.

 

 


 

 

 

 

71  

Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this _Section 9.8_ ,
Buchanan shall be deemed to be carrying on or engaged in a particular business
if he, she or it (whether alone or in  association with one or more other
Persons) is an owner, proprietor, partner, employee, stockholder, member,
independent contractor, director, manager or joint venturer of, or a
consultant or lender to, or an investor in any manner in, any Person who  or
which is directly or indirectly engaged in Competitive Business.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.8_ , Buchanan
or any Affiliate may own or share in the earnings of any Person in a
Competitive Business in the Territory, solely as an  investment, securities
if (i) Buchanan does not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own more than
five percent (5%), in the aggregate, of the class of which securities are a
part, (ii) such class of securities is publicly traded and (iii) Buchanan 
has no active participation in such entity.

 

 

(e) Buchanan acknowledges and agrees that the limitations imposed by this non-
competition covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity
being restrained are reasonable and do not impose a greater  restraint than
is necessary to protect the Confidential Information, goodwill or other
business interest of the Purchaser, which are being purchased and for which
Buchanan is being compensated pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

(f) The Purchaser and Buchanan hereby agree that if Buchanan or any Affiliate
of Buchanan violates or threatens to violate any of the provisions of this
Agreement, it would be difficult to determine the entire  cost, damage or
injury which the Purchaser would sustain. Buchanan acknowledges that if he (or
his Affiliates) violates or threatens to violate any of the provisions of this
Agreement, the Purchaser will not have a complete and adequate remedy at 
law. In that event, the Purchaser shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights that may be available to it, to seek to obtain in any court of
competent jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any violation or
threatened violation by  Buchanan or his Affiliates of any provision of this
Agreement or to compel specific performance by Buchanan of one or more of his
obligations under this _Section 9.8_. The seeking or obtaining by the
Purchaser of such injunctive relief shall  not foreclose or in any way limit
the right of the Purchaser to obtain a money judgment against Buchanan for any
damage to the Purchaser that may result from any breach by Buchanan of any
provision of this Agreement. In the event of a breach by  Buchanan of any
covenant set forth in this _Section 9.8_ , the term of such covenant will be
extended by the period of duration of such breach.

 

 

(g) Buchanan acknowledges that the covenants contained in this _Section 9.8_
are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects.
If any court of competent jurisdiction determines  that any of such
covenants, provisions or portions of this Agreement, or any part thereof, are
unenforceable and invalid, then (i) the validity and enforceability of any
remaining covenants, provisions or portions thereof shall not be affected by 
such determination, (ii) those of such covenants, provisions or portions that
are determined to be unenforceable because of the duration or scope thereof
shall be severed and/or reformed by the court to reduce their duration or
scope so as to render  the same enforceable against Buchanan, and (iii) all
remaining covenants, provisions, portions and terms of this Agreement shall be
valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 

 

 

72  

9.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent taken into consideration in
the calculation of Final Working Capital, Buchanan shall indemnify the
Companies, Purchaser and each Affiliate of the Purchaser  and hold them
harmless from and against, any Loss attributable to (i) any and all Taxes
imposed on any of the Companies or for which any such Company may otherwise be
liable for any Pre-Closing Date Tax Period (excluding the amount of any
increase in  such Taxes caused by or arising from (A) voluntary changes to
the Companies' depreciation methods after the Closing (unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements) or (B) actions which are excluded
from indemnification pursuant to _Section        9.1(a)(iii)(D)_ ),
(ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which any Company (or any predecessor) is or was a member on
or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation 
Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or non‑U.S. law or
regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Companies)
imposed on the Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant
to any law, rule,  or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv) any Taxes arising from the sale
of the Seller Equity or the Common Share Interest and the transactions
contemplated thereby and (v) any Taxes resulting  from a breach of
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.18_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including _Section 9.9_ or
_Section 9.1_ , because real estate taxes are included in the  calculation of
Working Capital and Final Working Capital, such real estate taxes are
specifically excluded from any indemnification obligation of Seller or
Buchanan.

 

 

(b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts or  payroll of the Companies
for the Pre-Closing Date Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and the
amount of other Taxes of the Companies for a Straddle Period relating  to the
Pre-Closing Date Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator  of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

 

(c) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes._ The Seller and
Seller's Shareholders shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared
and timely filed at their sole cost and expense all  income Tax Returns
required to be filed by the appropriate Governmental Authority or with respect
to the Companies for the period ending on or before the Closing Date that are
filed after the Closing Date and Seller and Seller's Shareholders shall be 
responsible for, and shall cause to be fully paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the amount of Taxes shown as payable with respect to
such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with past practice except to  the extent otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Returns, the Seller and Seller's Shareholders shall provide
the Purchaser with a copy of such Tax Returns for  review and comment and
shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as reasonably requested. The
Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all other
Tax Returns for the Companies that are filed after the Closing Date, 
including Tax Returns for the Straddle Period. Not later than fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller and Seller's Shareholders with a copy of such Tax Returns
for review and  comment and shall make such revisions to the Tax Returns as
reasonably requested. Upon request from the Purchaser, which shall be no
earlier than five (5) days before the due date for such a Tax Return, the
Seller and Seller's Shareholders shall pay  the Purchaser the amount of Taxes
owed by the Seller and Seller's Shareholders based on its obligations under
_Section 9.9(a)_ , including the Seller's share of the Taxes for such Straddle
Period, as determined in _Section 9.9(b)_. The  Purchaser and the Seller and
Seller's Shareholders shall each provide the other with all information
reasonably necessary to prepare a Tax Return.

 

 

 

73  

(d) _Responsibility for Tax Audits and Contests_. The Seller and Seller's
Shareholders shall control any audit or contest with respect to income Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Date Tax Period or, with respect to all other Taxes, for a
period ending on or before the Closing Date and  the Purchaser shall control
any other audit or contest; provided, however, that the Party with the greater

Seller and Seller's  Shareholders shall each provide the other with all
information reasonably necessary to conduct an audit or contest with respect
to Taxes.

and forever discharges Steven Buchanan and the other Seller's Shareholders and
their heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of and from all

implied, any covenant of good faith and fair dealing, express or implied, or
any tort, common law or otherwise, which any Company or such Seller's

herein, and other information requested by the Seller, Buchanan or their
Affiliates with respect to such matter) and (c) preparing the calculations as
referred to in _Section        2.4_. Unless otherwise consented to in

10.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the Parties and their 
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
Parties without the written consent of Purchaser, the Companies or the Seller,
as the case may  be.

 

 

10.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under  applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such  provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

10.5 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual 
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The use of the word "including" in this Agreement or in any of the agreements
contemplated hereby shall be by way of example rather than by limitation.

 

 

10.6 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not 
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and

10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall 
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

10.8 _Complete Agreement_. This document, the Confidentiality Agreements and
the documents referred to herein contain the complete agreement between the

counterparts, any one of which may be by facsimile, and all of which taken
together  shall constitute one and the same instrument. A signed copy of this

10.10 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_.

 

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule  (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. To the extent permitted by law,
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the  jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, over any suit,
action or other proceeding brought by any Party arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all 
claims with respect to any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be
heard and determined in such courts.

 

 

10.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information is contained in the
Disclosure Schedules solely for informational purposes, may not be required to
be  disclosed pursuant hereto and will not imply that such information or any
other information is required to be disclosed. Inclusion of such information
will not establish any level of materiality or similar threshold or be an
admission that any of  such information is material to the business, assets,
Liabilities, financial position, operations or results of operations of any
Person or otherwise material regarding such Person. Each matter disclosed in
any section of the Disclosure Schedules in  a manner that makes its relevance
to one or more other sections of the Disclosure Schedules reasonably apparent
will be deemed to have been appropriately included in each such other section
of the Disclosure Schedules (notwithstanding the presence or  absence of any
reference in or to any section of the Disclosure Schedules).

 

 

10.12 _Legal Representation; Conflicts Waiver_.

 

 

(a) _Post-Closing Representation_. Each of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including any Subsidiaries after the Closing, including the Companies and
their Affiliates), on its own behalf and on behalf  of its directors,
governors, members, shareholders, partners, managers, officers, employees and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Group_ "), hereby consents to
McGrath North Mullin and Kratz, PC LLO (" _McGrath North_ ") representing 
Seller, the Seller's Shareholders and any of their respective directors,
governors, members, shareholders, partners, managers, officers, employees or
Affiliates, or any of them (collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), after
Closing in connection  with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, the
transactions contemplated herein or any related proceeding, and hereby waives
to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements any conflicts of interest that
may arise in connection with such  representation, including any conflict of
interest based on the fact that McGrath North may have represented any member
of the Seller Group prior to Closing or in connection with this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document, the transactions contemplated  herein or any related
Proceeding and any conflict of interest based on services McGrath North
provides to any of the Seller Group after Closing.

 

 

 

81  

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. All communications involving attorney‑client
confidences among any of the Seller, the Seller's Shareholders, the Companies,
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and McGrath  North or Koley Jessen P.C.,
L.L.O. (" _Koley Jessen_ ") in the course of the negotiation and documentation
of the transactions contemplated herein shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Sellers (and not the  Purchaser, the
Companies, or their Affiliates) and may be controlled by the Seller (in
Seller's and Buchanan's sole discretion). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, upon and after Closing, (i) the Seller and Seller's
Shareholders and  their Affiliates (and not the Purchaser or its Affiliates)
will be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
negotiation and documentation of the transactions contemplated herein
(collectively, the " _Pre-sale  Communications_ "), and none of the Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries (including the Companies after the Closing and their
Affiliates) shall be a holder thereof, (ii) McGrath North shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Pre-sale  Communications or files
pertaining to any Pre-sale Communications to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Companies or their Affiliates) by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between McGrath North, Koley Jessen and Seller, 
Seller's Shareholders and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates or otherwise,
(iii) absent the consent of the Seller, neither the Purchaser nor the
Companies or their Affiliates following the Closing will have a right to
access attorney-client privileged  material of the Seller, Seller's
Shareholder or the Companies or their Affiliates related to the transactions
contemplated hereby on or after the Closing Date, and (iv) each Party will
take the steps necessary to ensure any privilege attaching as a  result of
McGrath North's and Koley Jessen's service as counsel to the Seller, Seller's
Shareholders or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein and in the Ancillary Documents will survive
Closing  and will remain in effect (but as stated herein). In addition, if
the transactions contemplated herein are consummated, all of McGrath North's
and Koley Jessen's records related to such transactions will become property
of (and be controlled by) the  Sellers and neither the Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates (including any Companies after the Closing and their
Affiliates) will retain any copies of such records or have any access to them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a  dispute arises between
the Purchaser Group, on the one hand, and a third party other than any of the
Seller Group, on the other hand, the Purchaser Group may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to 
such third party.

it  shall have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech
(such as a verb).

 

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that such Party and its attorney(s) have reviewed
this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, or  any similar
rule operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable to
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

 

82  

(d) The section headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and will not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation
of any provision hereof.

representatives acting as such, the " _Company Parties_ ") hereby agrees: (a)
that any suit, claim, legal action, arbitration, demand or proceeding, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (each, an "

underwriter or other counterparty with respect to any actual or potential
Financing or their respective Affiliates (collectively, with each of their

Parties_ "), arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Financing or
any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Financing or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder shall  be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court in the County of New York, New York and any appellate court
thereof (and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property
with respect to any such Action to the  exclusive jurisdiction of such
court); (b) that any such Action shall be governed by the laws of the State of
New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would
result in the application of the laws of another state),  except as expressly
otherwise provided in any applicable agreement relating to the Financing; (c)
not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled affiliates to bring or
support any Action against any Financing Party arising out of or relating  to
this Agreement, the Financing, any agreement relating thereto or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the County of
New York, New  York; (d) that it irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Action in any such court; (e) knowingly, intentionally and
voluntarily waives to the fullest  extent permitted by applicable law trial
by jury in any Action brought against the Financing Parties arising out of or

any services thereunder; (f) that none of the Financing Parties will have any
liability to any of the Company Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing, any agreement relating thereto or any of the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise; and (g) that (and each other party hereto agrees that) the
Financing Parties are  express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,
the provisions of this _Section 10.14_, and which provisions shall not be

consent.
