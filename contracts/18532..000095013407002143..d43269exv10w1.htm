STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of January 31, 2007 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and among CENTEX CONSTRUCTION GROUP, INC., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), CENTEX CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation (the "Seller"), BALFOUR BEATTY, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"), and BALFOUR BEATTY PLC, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the "Guarantor"). 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company and its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) are engaged in the business of providing commercial construction contracting services, including construction management, general contracting, design-build and preconstruction services ("Construction Services"), to various third parties; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) of the Company (the "Shares"); 

   

 WHEREAS, the Purchaser or one or more of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates are engaged in the business of providing Construction Services to various Third Parties (as hereinafter defined) and are familiar with the risks and benefits associated with such business; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller is willing to sell to the Purchaser, the Shares, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Designated Executives (as hereinafter defined) has entered into a Change of Control Agreement with the Seller and the Company effective as of the date hereof and an Employment Agreement with the Company to be effective at the Closing (as hereinafter defined); and 

   

 WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective meanings set forth in Article XIII; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the terms and provisions set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES 

   

 SECTION 1.1. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, on the Closing Date, (i) the Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver the Shares to the Purchaser free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens imposed as a result of actions 

   ##### 

  

    

taken by the Purchaser or arising under applicable federal or state
securities laws, and (ii) the Purchaser shall pay the consideration
described herein and acquire and accept the Shares from the Seller. 

  

 SECTION 1.2. _Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) In consideration of the sale, transfer and delivery of the Shares, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount (the "Initial Purchase Price") in cash equal to the sum of (i) $355,000,000 and (ii) $7,000,000 (the "Reserve Payment"). 

  

 (b) The final purchase price to be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller in consideration of the Shares shall be the sum of (i) the Initial Purchase Price and (ii) all Additional Payments made by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to Section 1.4 (the "Purchase Price"). 

  

 (c) All documentary, stamp, sales and excise or other similar Taxes (if any) payable in respect of the sale, transfer or delivery of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be apportioned 50% to the Seller and 50% to the Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such Taxes attributable to the sale, transfer or delivery of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 1.3. _Pre-Closing Payments_. On the Closing Date, but immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Seller and the Company shall make the following payments (the "Pre-Closing Payments"), the amount of which shall be estimated on a basis consistent with the Accounting Principles and the illustrations set forth in the Accounting Schedule: 

  

 (a) The Seller shall pay to the Company an amount (the "Seller Pre-Closing Payment") equal to the aggregate outstanding cash advances by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any member of the Seller Group (the "Cash Advance Amount"); and 

  

 (b) The Company shall pay to the Seller the following amounts (the "Company Pre-Closing Payments"): 

   

 (i) the amount of all intercompany obligations (other than any Retained Intercompany Obligations) owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any member of the Seller Group, less the amount of all intercompany obligations (other than any Retained Intercompany Obligations and the Cash Advance Amount) owing by any member of the Seller Group to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Net Intercompany Amount"); and 

   

 (ii) the amount of stockholders equity (including retained earnings) of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the "Stockholders Equity Amount"), which amount shall be paid in the form of a cash dividend or dividends. 

 

The Pre-Closing Payments to be made pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above
shall be offset against each other so that, in lieu of the parties making
each of the Pre-Closing Payments, either the Seller or the Company (as the
case may be) shall make a single 

    ##### 

  

    

payment to the other party equal to the net amount owing by the Seller to the
Company or the Company to the Seller pursuant to this Section 1.3. Each party
acknowledges that the calculation of the amount of the Pre-Closing Payments
to be paid on the Closing Date will be based on estimates of the applicable
amounts set forth in the Initial CFO Certificate. Accordingly, such payments
will be subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Article
III. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to the Purchaser a draft of the Initial CFO Certificate. 

   

 SECTION 1.4. _Additional Payments_. 

  

 (a) Provided the Section 338(h)(10) Election is timely and validly made, on each anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if such anniversary is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller $4,000,000 in cash, until such time as the Purchaser shall have made payments to the Seller pursuant to this Section 1.4 in an aggregate amount equal to $60,000,000 (collectively, the "Additional Payments"). Each Additional Payment to be made by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to such account or accounts as the Seller shall have specified to the Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to the due date for such payment). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a result of an amendment to the applicable provisions of the Code at any time after the date hereof, the Purchaser is not entitled to the benefits of the Section 338(h)(10) Election as currently provided for under the Code, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the amount of the Additional Payments to be made thereafter pursuant to this Section 1.4 so that the amount of such payments does not exceed 50% of the amount of the tax benefits to be realized thereafter by the Purchaser as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election (to be computed in an equitable manner that assumes all depreciation and amortization deductions resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election are used prior to any net operating loss deductions or deductions arising from payments made to or transactions with Affiliates of the Purchaser that may be available to the Purchaser); _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Seller be obligated to refund to the Purchaser any Additional Payments made or required to be made prior to the effective date of the applicable amendment to the Code. 

  

 (c) Provided the Section 338(h)(10) Election is timely and validly made, subject only to (i) the provisions of paragraph (b) above and (ii) reduction of the Additional Payments by the amount of any Losses that may be incurred by the Purchaser as a result of a failure on the part of the Seller to comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 8.8, the obligation of the Purchaser to make the Additional Payments in accordance with this Section 1.4 shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be subject to reduction or modification as a result of any change in the provisions of applicable Law or any action or omission on the part of the Seller or its Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to set off against its obligation to make any Additional Payments pursuant to this Section 1.4 any obligation or amount owing or alleged to be owing to the Purchaser or its Affiliates by the Seller or its Affiliates under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, including any obligation on the part of the Seller to make indemnification payments under Article VIII or XII.

ARTICLE II 

  

CLOSING

    

 SECTION 2.1. _Closing_.

No later than five days after a binding determination of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount has been made in accordance with Section 3.2 or 3.3 (as the case may be), (i) if the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount is greater than the Initial Pre-Closing Payment Amount, the Company shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to) pay to the Seller an amount equal to the difference between such amounts and (ii) if the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount is less than the Initial Pre-Closing Payment Amount, the Seller shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the difference between such amounts (any such payment to be made by the Company or the Seller being hereinafter referred to as the "Post-Closing Adjustment Payment"). The Post-Closing Adjustment Payment shall be made to the Seller or the Company, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to such account as is specified by such party at least two Business Days prior to the due date for such payment). Neither the Company nor the Seller shall be entitled to set off against its obligation to make any Post-Closing Adjustment Payment pursuant to this Section 3.1 any obligation or amount owing or alleged to be owing to such Person (as the case may be) by any other party to this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates) under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 3.2. _Final Balance Sheet_. No later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Company shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to) deliver to the Seller (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and without giving effect to the Pre-Closing Payments (the "Final Balance Sheet") prepared in a manner consistent with the Accounting Principles and the illustrations set forth in the Accounting Schedule and (ii) a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company on behalf of the Company setting forth a calculation in reasonable detail of the Excess Reserve Amount, the Cash Advance Amount, the Net Intercompany Amount and the Stockholders Equity Amount and the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount (the "Final CFO Certificate"), which shall be based on the Final Balance Sheet and prepared in a manner consistent with the Accounting Principles and the illustrations set forth in the Accounting Schedule. From the Closing Date through the date of the payment provided for in Section 3.1, the Company shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to) give the Seller reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records, the accounting and other appropriate personnel and the independent accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including access to each of the specific items of information described in the Accounting Schedule) in order to enable the Seller to review the Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount; _provided, however,_ that if required by the independent accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such independent accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers or other records available to the Seller unless and until the Seller has signed a customary agreement relating to such access and work papers or records in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. The calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount set forth in the Final CFO Certificate shall be binding upon each of the parties, unless the Seller objects to such calculation in accordance with Section 3.3(a). 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 3.3. _Dispute Resolution_. 

  

 (a) The Seller shall be entitled to dispute the calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount set forth in the Final CFO Certificate if, but only if, it delivers a written notice (an "Objection Notice") to the Purchaser within 45 days after receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and Final CFO Certificate in which it objects to the calculation by the Company of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount and provides a reasonably detailed description of each item to which it objects and the basis therefor (the date upon which the Seller delivers an Objection Notice to the Purchaser being hereinafter referred to as the "Objection Date"). 

  

 (b) If the Seller delivers an Objection Notice to the Purchaser within the time period specified in paragraph (a) above, the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount during the period commencing on the Objection Date and ending 30 days thereafter (the "Negotiation Period"). 

  

 (c) If the Purchaser and the Seller agree in writing prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period on the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount (whether such amount is the same as or different from the amount set forth in the Final CFO Certificate), the payment provided for in Section 3.1 shall be based upon the agreed upon amount. 

  

 (d) If the Purchaser and the Seller do not agree in writing prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period on the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount, the items in dispute (but no other matters) shall be submitted to KPMG LLP or such other firm of independent public accountants as may be mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Seller (in either case, the "Final Arbiter"), which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to all matters in dispute relating to the calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount as promptly as practicable after its appointment. The Final Arbiter shall send its written determination of all items in dispute, together with the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount (including each of the components thereof in dispute between the parties) and a reasonably detailed explanation of work performed by the Final Arbiter. The determination of the Final Arbiter, and the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount, shall be final and binding on the parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Final Arbiter shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller. 

  

 (e) From and after the determination of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount in accordance with the procedures specified in this Section 3.3, the term "Final Balance Sheet" as used in this Agreement shall mean the Final Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 3.2, as modified to reflect any changes to the amounts reflected in such Final Balance Sheet as a result of any agreement reached by the parties pursuant to paragraph (c) above or any determination reached by the Final Arbiter pursuant to paragraph (d) above.

Section 5.9(a) also sets forth each joint venture, teaming or similar arrangement that gives rise to a sharing of profits and expenses with respect to one or more projects between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand and any Third Party on the other that is not set forth on such schedule pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence because such joint venture or other arrangement does not constitute a Subsidiary of the Company ("Other Joint Venture Arrangement") in respect of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to make, or has made since April 1, 2005, any equity or debt investment, or any loans, advances or capital contributions, in excess of $100,000.

Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company (as the case may be) and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its activities or the character of the properties that it owns, leases or operates makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Division MAE.

   ##### 

  

    

restrictions on transfer under the Organizational Documents of such
Subsidiary or under federal and state securities laws as a result of the fact
that the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary have not been registered

outstanding Equity Interests in any Subsidiary of the Company have been issued
in violation of any preemptive rights or are subject to any preemptive rights
in favor of any Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 (i) Under United States federal, state and local and foreign Tax law, neither the Purchaser nor the Company is required to deduct and withhold any amount from the Purchase Price to be paid to any Person pursuant to Article I. 

  

 (j) Each of the entities identified in Section 5.17(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule qualifies (and has since the date of each such entitys formation qualified), and will qualify immediately after the Closing Date, to be treated as a partnership or entity disregarded as separate from its owners for United States federal income tax purposes, and none of the Company, any person in the Seller Group, or the IRS has taken a position inconsistent with such treatment.

The Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall discontinue use of the Seller Marks as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but not more than 90 days after the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that if the approval of a Governmental Authority is required to change the name of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries under or in connection with a Material Contract, then the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries will discontinue using such name as soon as practicable after such approval is obtained (provided that the Purchaser continues to diligently pursue such approvals). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company and its Subsidiaries may use the phrase "formerly known as Centex Construction" to refer to itself for a period of three years following the Closing Date. Except as permitted by the previous sentence, from and after the Closing, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any joint venture controlled by the Company may use the word "Centex" or any of the Seller Marks to market or promote the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Construction Services or in any marketing or promotional materials or media (including its internet website). Following the Closing Date, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be prohibited from making factual historical references to Construction Services projects completed by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date as projects performed by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 SECTION 7.9. _Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company, the Seller and the Purchaser have agreed upon a form of joint announcement to employees concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and a communication plan concerning the method and timing of the delivery of such announcement. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the parties will deliver such announcement to employees in accordance with such communication plan. 

  

 (b) On and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be responsible with respect to all employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act") and any similar state or local Laws. Section 7.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the names and the sites of employment or facilities of those individuals who suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) at any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the 90-day period prior to the date hereof, together with the date of each such employment loss, which schedule shall be updated with respect to the 90-day period prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to, with respect to any site of employment or facility of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at any time during the 90-day period following the Closing Date, take any employment action that would result in (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act), (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act), or (iii) any similar action under any applicable state or local Laws requiring notice to employees in connection with a plant closing or layoff, in each case without complying fully with the notice and other requirements of the WARN Act and any similar state or local Laws requiring notice to employees. In addition, the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties and to defend and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses which the Seller Indemnified Parties may incur in connection with any lawsuit, claim, arbitration, action or other proceeding brought against the Seller Indemnified Parties under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Laws, which relates, in whole or in part, to any actions taken by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries with regard to any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) For a period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2007, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide (i) base compensation for the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) health and welfare benefits and profit sharing/401(k) benefits for said employees, and (iii) except with respect to the Designated Executives, incentive compensation and bonus schemes for said employees, which in the aggregate as to each such category are substantially equal (in all material respects) to the compensation or benefits in said category provided to said employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date and reflected in Section 5.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) With respect to each employee benefit plan of the Purchaser ("Purchaser Benefit Plan") in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") participate after the Closing Date, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service 

   ##### 

  

    

with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
the Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that such service need not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Plan. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser shall
cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar)
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under Purchaser Benefit Plans to be waived with respect to such
Company Employees and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments)
made during the plan year including the period prior to the Closing Date for
the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Purchaser Benefit Plans in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) To the extent legally and practically possible, the Purchaser intends to continue the benefits provided pursuant to the broad-based Seller Plans listed in Section 5.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for at least the period ending December 31, 2007. To accommodate this intent, the parties shall take the following actions: 

   

 (i) No later than March 15, 2007, the Seller shall have spun off from Sellers Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan, those accounts which are maintained for current employees of the Company, into a successor profit sharing/401(k) plan which shall be created, adopted and maintained by the Company prior to said date _; provided, however_ , recognizing that there will be issues concerning the physical transfer of those assets held in the current trust for the Sellers said plan, such as the disposition or maintenance of accounts invested in the Sellers common stock and in commingled funds which may not be available as investment choices for the plan established solely for eligible employees of the Company, if such spin off does not occur by March 15, 2007, the parties covenant to cooperate with the fiduciaries and administrators of the Sellers said plan to provide legal documentation and participant communications necessary and appropriate for the transition and shall cause the spin off to occur as soon as practicable thereafter. As of the Closing, the plan maintained by the Company will be independent of the Sellers Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and after the Closing Date (and, to the extent possible using commercially reasonable efforts, for the completed payroll period immediately preceding the Closing Date) contributions from Company employees after the Closing Date shall be made into the Companys new plan. Prior to or on May 31, 2007, the Company shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, contribute cash to the Companys new profit sharing plan in the Ordinary Course of Business in the amount of the accrual on the Latest Balance Sheet. 

   

 (ii) With respect to the Sellers Salary Continuation Plan, the Seller shall create a separate plan, with otherwise identical terms, and provide for its adoption by the Company, for the benefit of participating employees of the Company, prior to March 15, 2007. The parties will cooperate in negotiations with the insurance company which underwrites the policy used by the Seller as the funding mechanism for benefits provided by said plan, to provide for the transfer of the appropriate portion of 

   ##### 

  

    

the existing group policy to the Company, which intends to continue said
funding arrangement. 

   

 (iii) With respect to the Sellers health and death benefit and other welfare benefit plans which are Company Plans and are listed in Section 5.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Seller will establish separate such plans for the benefit of eligible employees of the Company prior to March 15, 2007. The parties will cooperate to negotiate with the insurance companies, plan administrators and other applicable parties to provide for the continuation of necessary services for the continued maintenance of said plans, and the Seller shall transfer to the Company, no later than 30 days following Closing, cash equal to the net positive balances in all spending accounts maintained for the Company employees who participate in the health care and dependent care spending account plans listed in Section 5.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; the Company shall hold said assets for purposes of meeting the obligations to said participants pursuant to the terms of said continued plans. 

   

 (iv) No later than the Closing Date, the Seller shall have spun off from Sellers Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, those accounts which are maintained for current employees of the Company, into a successor supplemental executive retirement plan which shall be created, adopted and maintained by the Company prior to said date. As of the Closing, the plan maintained by the Company will be independent of the Sellers Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, and the Company shall be responsible for accumulations both before and after the Closing under such plans. 

   

 (v) All reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates in connection with establishing new Company plans pursuant to paragraphs (i) through (iv) above shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser within 30 days after invoice therefor. 

   

 (vi) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.9(e) in connection with the creation of new Company plans or by the Change of Control Agreements, with respect to the Sellers equity incentive plans and deferred cash compensation paid pursuant to Sellers incentive plans, the Seller shall cause the outstanding awards of all Company employees to become fully vested no later than Closing, and the Company shall distribute the appropriate benefits thereunder according to the terms of said plans. 

  

 (f) The Seller shall retain the liability for payment of all covered claims (including medical, dental, life insurance, long-term disability and workers compensation) or expenses arising prior to the Closing Date by any Person under all Seller Plans and for all related benefits and amounts payable thereunder with respect to pre-Closing periods. The Company shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to) pay to the Seller all fees, costs, expenses, self-insured retention amounts or deductibles incurred by the Seller in connection with such covered claims within 20 days after receipt of invoice therefor from the Seller in accordance with past practice. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) The parties acknowledge that prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Seller and the Company have entered into the Change of Control Agreements with the Designated Executives and (ii) the Company has entered into the Employment Agreements with the Designated Executives. 

  

 (h) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 7.9 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the Company or the Purchaser. 

  

 (i) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Losses arising out of the Legal Proceedings identified in Section 7.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 7.9(i) shall not include any Claims arising out of the ownership of Seller stock from and after the Closing Date by any new plan created for the Company in accordance with this Section 7.9 or otherwise. In addition, the parties agree that Sections 12.6 and 12.8 and the last sentence of Section 12.7 shall apply to this Section 7.9(i). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Purchaser Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith with the reasonable requests of the Seller to take all steps necessary to trigger, effectuate and/or preserve coverage under any insurance policy applicable to any Losses covered by this Section 7.9(i), including providing prompt notice to the Seller of any relevant claim or Losses. 

  

 (j) The Seller shall pay to each of the Designated Executives all amounts (as and when due thereunder) required to be paid by the Seller pursuant to the Change of Control Agreements and the Company shall pay to each of the Designated Executives all amounts (as and when due thereunder) required to be paid by the Company pursuant to the Change of Control Agreements. 

  

 SECTION 7.10. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, in the case of any threatened or actual Claim or Legal Proceeding, including any such Claim or Legal Proceeding by a Third Party or by or in the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in which any individual who is as of the Closing Date or was at any time on or after the date hereof a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "DandO Indemnified Party") is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the fact that such DandO Indemnified Party is or was, prior to the Closing Date, (x) a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) serving as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether such Claim or Legal Proceeding arises before, on or after the Closing Date), the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such DandO Indemnified Party against any Losses and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such Claim or Legal Proceeding except to the extent that the facts and circumstances which gave rise to such Losses, amounts paid, Claim or Legal Proceeding include actions or 

   ##### 

  

    

omissions which involve intentional misconduct or fraud by such DandO
Indemnified Party. In the case of any such Claim or Legal Proceeding with
respect to which the Purchaser or the Company is required to provide
indemnification hereunder, (i) the Purchaser or the Company (as specified by
the Purchaser) may, at its election, assume the defense of such matter, in
which case, any DandO Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense and
through legal counsel of its choice, in any such Claim or Legal Proceeding;
_provided, however_ , that if the Purchaser or the Company fails to assume
such defense or, under applicable standards of professional conduct, there
exists a conflict of interest on any significant issue between the Purchaser
and the Company, on the one hand, and any of the DandO Indemnified Parties, on
the other hand, the DandO Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Purchaser or the Company shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii) the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
in the vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided, however_ , that
neither the Purchaser nor the Company, as the case may be, shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (b) The Purchaser shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period of three years from and after the Closing Date, to keep in effect in the Organizational Documents of the Company and each such Subsidiary provisions providing for indemnification of the DandO Indemnified Parties that are at least as favorable as the provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company and each such Subsidiary in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing except to the extent otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law. 

  

 (c) The covenants in this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and successors. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a DandO Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party which is the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.10. 

  

 (d) If the Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 7.10, the Purchaser shall cause the successors and assigns of the Company to, make proper provision to succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10 or, as long as the Purchaser retains a substantial portion of its properties and assets following such transaction, the Purchaser may elect to assume and succeed to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7.10.

 SECTION 7.11. _Certain Surety Bonds, Guarantees and other Obligations_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate, at the request of the Purchaser and at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser, with the Purchaser in connection with its efforts to obtain a new bonding facility to be utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing; _provided, however_ , that, prior to the Closing, nothing contained in this Section 7.11 shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake or assume any liabilities or obligations, deliver any certificates, make any representations or warranties or provide any opinions of counsel or similar assurances to or for the benefit of any financing sources or other Third Parties who are to provide such new bonding facility. 

  

 (b) The Company and the Purchaser hereby acknowledge that, in connection with the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries have arranged for the issuance of Surety Bonds and the Seller and certain other members of the Seller Group, as obligors, indemnitors or guarantors or in any other capacity, have assumed, undertaken or otherwise become subject to certain liabilities and obligations, whether existing or inchoate, matured or unmatured, unconditional or contingent, arising under or with respect to Surety Bonds, including, but not limited to, obligations on the part of any member of the Seller Group to provide indemnification, make any payments, perform any covenant or undertake any obligation under the Surety Indemnity Agreements (any such liabilities and obligations, a "Surety Bond Obligation"). From and after the Closing, (i) the Company hereby assumes and agrees to pay and perform all Surety Bond Obligations, other than the Retained Bond Obligations (the "Assumed Bond Obligations"), and (ii) the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Seller Group from and against all payments made or other Losses asserted against, imposed on or incurred by any member of the Seller Group as a result of or based upon the Assumed Bond Obligations (but excluding any Losses in respect of any Retained Bond Obligations). It is understood and agreed that the Losses for which the members of the Seller Group are entitled to indemnification under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall include any reimbursement obligations in respect of amounts drawn under any letter of credit provided to Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America pursuant to the Ratings Amendment dated as of August 21, 2002 in respect of the Travelers Indemnity Agreement or the letters of credit listed in Section 7.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any Losses arising from the use or application by the sureties of any cash collateral or other security provided by the Seller under the Surety Indemnity Agreements (except to the extent that such reimbursement obligations or Losses are in respect of any Retained Bond Obligations). From and after the Closing, the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance of the letters of credit listed in Section 7.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be borne 50% by the Company and 50% by the Seller. The Company and the Purchaser hereby further agree (I) to comply (in the case of the Company), to cause the Company to comply (in the case of the Purchaser) and to cause each of the Subsidiaries of the Company to comply (in the case of the Purchaser and the Company) with each of the obligations of the Company and any of such Subsidiaries under the Surety Indemnity Agreements (other than the Retained Bond Obligations), (II) to provide to the Seller notice within 5 Business Days of the Company or any its Subsidiaries becoming aware of any Claims made by the sureties under the Surety Indemnity Agreements or of any affirmative exercise by any of such sureties of such 

   ##### 

  

    

suretys rights to payment or performance under the Surety Indemnity
Agreements, such notice to describe the applicable Claim or exercise
of rights of payment or performance and the related circumstances in
reasonable detail, (III) to provide to the Seller the same books, records,
information and documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which are
provided to the sureties under the Surety Indemnity
Agreements contemporaneously with the delivery of such books, records,
information and documents to the sureties and, promptly after either a Claim
by any such surety in respect of Surety Bond Obligations or any other
circumstance leading to a notice or request by any such surety for access to
books, records, information or documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to provide to the Seller the same access rights to books,
records, information or documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as are provided to such surety under the Surety Indemnity Agreements and (IV)
to not, and to cause each of the Companys Subsidiaries to not, request, cause
or otherwise consent to the issuance under any Surety Indemnity Agreement.
after the Closing, of any Surety Bonds, it being understood that certain
actions taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing may
result in the issuance of Bonds under such indemnity agreements after the
Closing. The Seller (A) shall not, and shall cause the other members of the
Seller Group to not, after the Closing, affirmatively request, or take any
other affirmative action to cause, the issuance under either the Travelers
Indemnity Agreement or the Zurich Indemnity Agreement of any Bonds (as
defined in either of such indemnity agreements), it being understood that
certain actions taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
may result in the issuance of Surety Bonds under such indemnity agreements
after the Closing, (B) shall comply, from and after the Closing, with each of
the Retained Bond Obligations required to be complied with by it under the
Surety Indemnity Agreements, (C) shall provide to the Purchaser notice within
5 Business Days of the Seller becoming aware of any Claims made by the
sureties against Seller under the Surety Indemnity Agreements or of any
affirmative exercise by any of such sureties against the Seller of such
suretys rights to payment or performance under the Surety Indemnity
Agreements, such notice to describe the applicable Claim or exercise of
rights to payment or performance and the related circumstances in reasonable
detail and (D) shall provide to the Purchaser the same books, records,
information and documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
possession of the Seller (if any) which are provided to the sureties under
the Surety Indemnity Agreements contemporaneously with the delivery of such
books, records, information and documents to the sureties and, promptly
after either a Claim by any such surety in respect of Surety Bond Obligations
or any other circumstance leading to a notice or request by any such surety
for access to books, records, information or documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the possession of the Seller (if any), to provide to
the Purchaser the same access rights to books, records, information or
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of the
Seller (if any) as are provided to such surety under the Surety Indemnity
Agreements. At the Closing, the parties shall cause to be executed notices
(the "Surety Termination Notices") of the termination of the Travelers
Indemnity Agreement and Zurich Indemnity Agreement with respect to the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each member of the Seller Group that
is a party thereto (which notices shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Seller and the Purchaser) and, pursuant to the terms
of such agreements, shall cause such notices to be delivered to the sureties
under the Travelers Indemnity Agreement and the Zurich Indemnity Agreement
on a date mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, which date
shall be no more than five Business 

   ##### 

  

    

Days after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the obligations of the Purchaser under
this paragraph (b) are absolute and unconditional, and shall not be subject
to reduction or modification as a result of any change in the terms of the
Surety Bonds (including increases thereof) or the Contracts underlying the
Surety Bonds or the Surety Indemnity Agreements (other than changes under the
Surety Indemnity Agreements to which the Seller has affirmatively consented
after the Closing and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
affirmatively consented), any change after the date hereof in any provision
of applicable Law relating to the Surety Bonds or such Contracts or the
Surety Indemnity Agreements or any action or omission on the part of any
member of the Seller Group, including, but not limited to, any failure on the
part of the Seller to comply with any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein (in each case, other than acts or omissions giving
rise to Losses in respect of the Retained Bond Obligations or a breach
or violation of the obligations of the Seller under the express terms of this
paragraph (b)). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall not be entitled to set off against any indemnification or
payment obligations provided for in this paragraph (b) any obligation
or amount owing or alleged to be owing to the Purchaser or its Affiliates by
any member of the Seller Group under or in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise, including any obligation on the part of the Seller to make
indemnification payments under Article VIII or XII. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cooperate, at the request of the Seller and at the sole cost and expense of the Seller, with the Seller in connection with its efforts to enter into an arrangement (the "Merrill Lynch Indemnity and Reimbursement Arrangement") with Merrill Lynch Bank USA, or one or more of its Affiliates acceptable to the Seller or the Purchaser (except that, in the case of the Purchaser, its acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) ("Merrill Lynch"), under which Merrill Lynch will agree to indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Seller Group from and against all payments made or other Losses asserted against, imposed on or incurred by any member of the Seller Group as a result of or based upon the Assumed Bond Obligations; _provided, however,_ that the neither the Purchaser nor the Guarantor nor any of their respective Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be required to become parties to the definitive agreements providing for the Merrill Lynch Indemnity and Reimbursement Arrangement, it being understood that the execution of such definitive agreements shall not change the obligations of the parties hereunder, except that, if any rights and benefits of the Seller are assigned to Merrill Lynch as permitted under Sections 14.9 and 15.4, Merrill Lynch shall be entitled to exercise such rights as fully and to the same extent as the Seller. In the event that the Seller determines that it will not be feasible to enter into the Merrill Lynch Indemnity and Reimbursement Arrangement, the Purchaser and the Guarantor agree to provide to the Seller the additional rights relating to the Surety Bonds described in Section 7.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) The Purchaser further acknowledges that, in connection with the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Seller and certain other members of the Seller Group, as obligors or guarantors or in any other capacity undertaken, have assumed or otherwise become subject to certain liabilities and obligations, whether existing or inchoate, matured or unmatured, unconditional or contingent, arising under or with respect to the leases or other Contracts (other than the Surety Bonds) listed on Section 7.11(d) of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Disclosure Schedule (each, an "Other Seller Obligation"). The
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such member
of the Seller Group to (and the Seller shall cooperate with the Purchasers
reasonable requests in connection therewith) be fully, unconditionally
and irrevocably released and discharged from the Other Seller Obligations
prior to or at Closing, in each case through arrangements satisfactory to the
Seller under which the Purchaser or one or more of its Affiliates shall (if
necessary) act as a substituted obligor, guarantor or other counterparty. To
the extent that any of the Other Seller Obligations have not been
fully, unconditionally and irrevocably released and discharged prior to or at
Closing in accordance with this Section 7.11(d), from and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each such member of the Seller Group to be fully, unconditionally
and irrevocably released and discharged from such Other Seller Obligations as
promptly as practicable. In addition, from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Seller Group
from and against all payments made or other Losses incurred by any member of
the Seller Group after the Closing Date under or in connection with any Other
Seller Obligation. Until such time as each Other Seller Obligation has been
fully, unconditionally and irrevocably released and discharged, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to, increase or materially modify such Other
Seller Obligation without Sellers prior written consent. 

  

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 7.11 are not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.5(c), and (ii) nothing in this Section 7.11 shall (or is intended to) limit the Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to Article XII in respect of a breach by the Seller of any of the provisions of this Section 7.11 or any other provision contained herein. 

  

 (f) Each of the parties hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that the rights to indemnification provided to any member of the Seller Group pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall apply regardless of whether such Losses arise in whole or in part from any negligence or other fault on the part of any member of the Seller Group, but subject to any express limitations contained in this Section 7.11. 

  

 SECTION 7.12. _Settlement of Intercompany Obligations_. Other than obligations arising under the Transition Services Agreement or the intercompany obligations related to Contracts for Construction Services between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand or any member of the Seller Group on the other hand (i) listed in Section 5.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii) arising out of a Contract entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business after the date hereof (collectively, the "Retained Intercompany Obligations"), the parties agree that the Pre-Closing Payments and the post-closing adjustment provided for in Article III shall cause all obligations for the payment of intercompany accounts which are owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any member of the Seller Group or which are owed by any member the Seller Group to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be settled and fully and completely discharged. In addition, the Seller and the Company agree to enter into appropriate agreements and take other appropriate actions to implement each of the arrangements described in Section 7.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule prior to the Closing. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 7.13. _Litigation Support and Cooperation_. If and for so long as any party hereto is actively contesting or defending against any Claim or Legal Proceeding arising in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than an action brought by one party to this Agreement against another party or parties under the terms of this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), each of the parties will cooperate with the contesting or defending party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article XII); _provided, however,_ that the obligations of the parties contained in this Section 7.13 with respect to Claims or Legal Proceedings of the type described in clause (ii) above shall not apply until after the Closing unless any such Claims or Legal Proceedings would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or otherwise materially delay or otherwise affect in any material respect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 7.14. _Third-Party Reports_. Attached as Part I of Section 7.14 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is a list of all reports prepared or to be prepared by any consultant, professional or other third party (other than reports prepared by accountants or legal counsel to the Purchaser and comparative salary reports or employee compensation matters) for or on behalf of the Purchaser in connection with their due diligence review of the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition. Purchaser has caused to be delivered to the Seller copies of, or in respect of reports not yet delivered to the Purchaser, within five days after the delivery thereof to the Purchaser (but in no event later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date), the Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Seller copies of, all reports relating to insurance and environmental matters. Nothing in this Section 7.14 shall limit (or is intended to limit) the Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to Article XII. 

  

 SECTION 7.15. _Occurrence-Based Insurance Policies_. The Purchaser and the Seller agree that the parties shall cooperate with each other upon the terms set forth in this Section 7.15 so that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall retain the benefit of "occurrence" based insurance policies of the type listed in Part II of Schedule 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedule in relation to events occurring prior to the Closing but in respect of which no claim has yet arisen at the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the retention by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the benefit of such "occurrence" based policies shall, to the extent such coverage also exists with respect to the Seller Group, be without prejudice to the rights of the Seller Group to continue to retain (at the Sellers expense) the benefit of such "occurrence" based policies at and after the Closing Date as such policies were in effect prior to the Closing. If requested by the Company at any time from and after the Closing Date, to the extent necessary to effectuate coverage, the Seller shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Company, (i) submit claims to the insurers issuing such "occurrence" based policies in respect of losses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries that are insured thereby and (ii) pursue enforcement of such right of recovery 

   ##### 

  

    

for so long as the pursuit thereof is commercially reasonable, using the same
degree of effort and otherwise in a manner consistent with the practices of
the Seller during the three-year period prior to the Closing Date in respect
of claims involving the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any monies received by
the Seller as a result of such claims shall be paid promptly by the Seller to
the Company, net of any fees, costs, expenses, self-insured retention amounts
or deductibles (other than any applicable "deductible buy-down" amount
described in Section 7.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in respect of
any claims which may be made under such "occurrence" based insurance policies
arising out of events or omissions from October 1, 1996 through September 30,
2002) incurred by the Seller in connection with its or the Companys pursuit
of such claims that have not been paid or reimbursed by the Company
(collectively, "Reimbursement Amounts"). The Company shall (and the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to) pay to the Seller all Reimbursement Amounts
within 20 days after receipt of such invoice therefore from the Seller.
Section 7.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth the
deductible and self-insured retention amounts applicable to workers
compensation insurance. 

  

 SECTION 7.16. _Updates_. 

  

 (a) Within a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser of any adverse development which is reasonably expected to prevent the Seller from delivering to the Purchaser the certificates described in Section 9.3 without any qualification not contemplated by such provision; _provided,_ that no such disclosure shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules. 

  

 (b) Until Closing, no later than the 25th day of each calendar month beginning after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser an update of the Project Dispute List as of the end of the previous calendar month (each, an "Updated Project Dispute List"). Within three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser the most recent Updated Project Dispute List with any updates, as of the most recent practicable date, that, to the Companys Knowledge, would reasonably be expected to be disclosed on the next Updated Project Dispute List. For purposes of this Section 7.16, such updated information shall be deemed an Updated Project Dispute List. Each Updated Project Dispute List shall be prepared by the Company in the Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with the principles and procedures described in Part III of Section 5.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) If any Updated Project Dispute List delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to paragraph (b) above discloses any new contractual or other dispute between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand and any Third Party on the other hand in connection with the performance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Construction Services which was not disclosed in the Project Dispute List or in Part I of Section 5.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (without duplication of disputes previously disclosed on any prior Updated Project Dispute List, each a "New Contractual Dispute"), the following provisions shall apply: 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller shall have no liability under or in connection with this Agreement in respect of Losses related to any such New Contractual Disputes to the extent that the aggregate 

   ##### 

  

    

amount of Losses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of
such New Contractual Disputes is equal to or less than an amount equal to (x)
$500,000 multiplied by (y) the number of months in respect of which Updated
Project Dispute Lists have been delivered (and such amount shall be prorated
for any time periods less than a full month, the "Ordinary Course Amount"). 

   

 (ii) If the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of such New Contractual Disputes that are disclosed on an Updated Project Dispute List exceeds the Ordinary Course Amount, then all Losses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such New Contractual Disputes (including any reasonable fees, costs, expenses, self-insured retention amounts or deductibles incurred by a party hereto in connection with its or the Companys pursuit of insurance recoveries or other third-party reimbursements for such Losses consistent with past practice) in an amount exceeding the Ordinary Course Amount shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the Seller. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all liability of the Seller for any Losses pursuant to this Section 7.16, together with all liability for Purchaser Covered Losses pursuant to Article XII, shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.5(b) and therefore limited to an aggregate amount of $40,000,000; _provided, however_ , that if the estimated liability, as determined in accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in Section 5.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and set forth in the relevant Updated Project Dispute List (the "Estimated Liability Amount"), for all New Contractual Disputes that are disclosed on any Updated Project Dispute List (without duplication) exceeds $10,000,000, and the Purchaser delivers a written notice to such effect to the Seller within two Business Days after receipt of the Updated Project Dispute List containing an Estimated Liability Amount for all New Contractual Disputes disclosed thereon in excess of $10,000,000, all liability of the Seller for any Losses pursuant to this Section 7.16 shall be excluded from the limitations set forth in Section 12.5(b) and Seller shall immediately and automatically have the right to terminate this Agreement upon not less than two Business Days prior written notice to the Purchaser to that effect (or immediately upon written notice if the notice delivered by the Purchaser described in this paragraph is delivered to the Seller on a date that is less than two Business Days prior to Closing). 

  

 (e) The limitations set forth in Section 12.5(a) shall not apply to any liability of the Seller for any Losses pursuant to this Section 7.16. However, the limitations and other provisions set forth in Sections 12.5(e), 12.6 and 12.7 shall always apply to all Losses incurred by the parties in connection with any New Contractual Disputes pursuant to this Section 7.16. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this Section 7.16 shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies available to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of any Losses shared pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 7.16, it being understood that the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not seek to recover any such Losses from the Seller or any of its Affiliates based on a claim of a breach of any other provision of this Agreement, including Sections 5.7, 5.12(c) or 5.14. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph (f) shall not prevent any Purchaser Indemnified Party from seeking indemnification pursuant to the provisions of 

   ##### 

  

    

Article XII for any beach by the Seller of its obligation to pay any Losses
for which it is liable under the terms of paragraph (c) above. 

  

 SECTION 7.17. _Non-Competition_. 

  

 (a) For a period of 18 months from and after the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), Seller shall not, and shall cause each other member of the Seller Group not to, engage, whether directly as a principal or indirectly as a shareholder, partner, investor or contractor, in the business of providing Construction Services to any Third Party in connection with the construction of multi-unit residential, healthcare, education, corporate office, corrections or other commercial projects of a type similar to those undertaken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the three-year period prior to the Closing Date (the "Covered Business") in the area consisting of the United States of America (the "Territory"). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, this Section 7.17 shall not prohibit any member of the Seller Group from: 

   

 (i) engaging in any businesses, operations or activities of a type currently conducted by any member of the Seller Group, including (A) the businesses, operations or activities of the Sellers home building segment relating to the purchase and development of land or lots and the construction and sale of detached and attached single-family homes and land or lots (including (1) resort and second home properties and lots and (2) urban properties of the type constructed and sold by the CityHomes division of the Seller) and the engagement by any member of the Seller Group of any Affiliate or Third Party to provide Construction Services in connection with the development, construction and sale of homes by its home building business and (B) the activities of the Sellers financing segment, including mortgage lending, mortgage origination and servicing, title agency services and the sale of other insurance products and other related services; 

   

 (ii) acquiring a Person or business (whether in the form of a purchase of stock, merger, consolidation, asset purchase or in any other form) whose principal line of business does not consist of operations within the scope of the Covered Business, and operating and controlling any such Person or business, whether or not such Person or business has ancillary operations within the scope of the Covered Business, so long as (A) the applicable member of the Seller Group uses commercially reasonable efforts to divest (to an unaffiliated Third Party) as soon as commercially practicable, and actually divests within one year from the date of such acquisition or business combination, the portion of such Person or business engaged in operations within the scope of the Covered Business (except that the applicable member of the Seller Group shall not be required to divest such operations to the extent that they are of a type permitted to be conducted under subparagraph (b)(i) above) or (B) the annual revenues of such acquired Person or business for the last completed fiscal year ending prior to the time of such acquisition that are attributable to operations within the scope of the Covered Business (excluding operations of a type permitted to be conducted under subparagraph (b)(i) above) are 

   ##### 

  

    

less than $250,000,000 when aggregated with the annual revenues of any other
acquired Person or business for the last completed fiscal year ending prior
to the time of such acquisition that are attributable to operations within the
scope of the Covered Business (excluding operations of a type permitted to be
conducted under subparagraph (b)(i) above); or 

   

 (iii) acquiring, holding and disposing of not more than 5% of the then outstanding capital stock of any Person whose capital stock is publicly traded at the time it is acquired by the applicable member of the Seller Group. 

 

Notwithstanding any term or provision of this paragraph (b) to the contrary,
the exceptions set forth in subparagraph (b)(i) and (ii) above shall not be
construed to permit any member of the Seller Group to engage in operations
within the scope of the portion of the Covered Business that relates to the
Companys participation in the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (or
any successor program or program with substantially similar objectives)
unless the annual revenues attributable to all such operations are less than
$25,000,000 in the aggregate; _provided_ , that nothing contained herein
shall be construed to prohibit the Seller and its Affiliates from
building homes and providing related services to individuals who are members
of the military outside of the Companys participation in the Military
Housing Privatization Initiative (or any successor program or program with
substantially similar objectives). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.17, if the Seller is acquired by any Person or Persons (an "Acquiror") in a transaction (whether in the form of an acquisition of stock, merger, consolidation, asset purchase or in any other form) that would constitute a change in control of the Seller within the meaning of Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act, the provisions of this Section 7.17 shall, after the consummation of such transaction, apply only to the assets and operations of the Seller Group as constituted immediately prior to such transaction, and shall not apply to any other assets and operations of the Acquiror. 

  

 (d) If any of the provisions of this Section 7.17 is held to be unreasonably broad, oppressive or unenforceable by a court or other Governmental Authority, such court or other Governmental Authority (i) shall narrow the Non-Competition Period, the scope of the Covered Business or the Territory or shall otherwise endeavor to reform the scope of such provisions in order to ensure that the application thereof is not unreasonably broad, oppressive or unenforceable and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall enforce such provisions as so reformed.

Furthermore, the Seller shall not market or promote any member in the Seller Group who is engaging in the business of providing Construction Services as the entity that performed the Construction Services projects completed by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing;  _provided,_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _however_ , that the Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to (i) state
as a part of their marketing and promotional activities that such projects
were completed by a former affiliate or subsidiary of the Seller and no
longer owned by the Seller and (ii) for a period of one year following the
Closing Date, use any marketing or promotional materials or media (including
its internet website) in existence as of the Closing Date until such
materials or media are exhausted or are updated in the ordinary course of the
Sellers and its Affiliates business.

The Seller will not vote its Shares in favor of any such acquisition. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 TAX MATTERS 

   

 SECTION 8.1. _Allocation of Tax Liabilities; Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 8.1, the Seller shall be liable for and shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless against (i) any liability for Taxes and any related Losses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including all Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or that otherwise result from any of them being a member of a consolidated federal income Tax Return or a combined/consolidated unitary state income Tax Return which includes the Seller) for any Pre-Closing Period and the portion of any Straddle Period that begins prior to and ends at the Effective Time, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected or reserved for on the Final Balance Sheet, and (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries resulting from making the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including any liability for Taxes arising from any election comparable to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code under state or local laws. 

  

 (b) The Purchaser shall be liable for and shall hold the Seller harmless against any liability for Taxes and any related Losses (i) for any Pre-Closing Period and the portion of any Straddle Period that begins prior to and ends at the Effective Time, but only to the extent that such Taxes are reflected or reserved for on the Final Balance Sheet, and (ii) for any Post-Closing Period and the portion of any Straddle Period that begins after the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Wherever it is necessary for purposes of this Section 8.1 to determine liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period, the determination shall be made by assuming (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") of the Company and its Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Company and its Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period. 

  

 (d) The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by the Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates, of notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments relating to Taxes for which the Seller would be required to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(a). 

  

 (e) The Seller shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax as to which the Seller is required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (including the right to conduct and control the conduct of such audit or proceeding and to settle any obligation for which the Seller is responsible), and may employ counsel of its own choice, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, in connection with such audit or proceeding. The Purchaser shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in any such audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which would materially adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Post-Closing Period without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Seller elects not to assume the defense of any claim for Taxes as to which the Seller is required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a), the Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct the defense thereof. Regardless of whether the Seller assumes the defense of any claim for Taxes as to which the Seller is required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a), none of the Purchaser nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to settle any claim for such Taxes without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (f) The Seller shall have no liability under Section 8.1(a) for the payment of any Tax or related Losses attributable to or resulting from any action of the type described in Section 8.2. 

  

 (g) The indemnification provided under this Article VIII shall be in addition to any indemnification provided for in Article XII. 

  

 SECTION 8.2. _No Changes in Elections, etc._ Other than the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Purchaser shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates not to, make or change any 

   ##### 

  

    

Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any Tax position on any Tax
Return, take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any
transaction that results in any increased Tax liability or reduction of any
Tax asset of the Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period. 

  

 SECTION 8.3. _Returns and Reports; Elections_. 

  

 (a) The Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (i) all Tax Returns with respect to Taxes that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period and (ii) all state and local Tax Returns in jurisdictions, if any, where the laws of such jurisdiction do not follow the federal income tax treatment of an election made pursuant to Code Section 338(h)(10). In the case of a Tax Return prepared by the Seller pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the Seller shall provide to Purchaser a copy of such Tax Return within 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the filing thereof, and Purchaser shall have the right to approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) such Tax Return. 

  

 (b) The Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns with respect to Taxes that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period.

The Seller shall promptly pay to the Purchaser the amount of the Tax liability disclosed on such Tax Return to be paid by the Seller in accordance with Section 8.1 at the time such tax return is filed or upon adjustment of such Tax amount by a Governmental Entity, as finally determined. 

  

 (d) For each Subsidiarys taxable period within which the Closing Date occurs, the Seller shall, except as described in Section 8.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, make or cause to be made an election pursuant to Code section 754 with respect to each Subsidiary. With respect to the entity described in Section 8.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent from the other owners of such entity that is required in order to cause such election to be made. 

  

 (e) The Seller will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all final partnership Tax Returns of the Subsidiaries (consistent with the Allocation Schedule) for taxable periods that include the Closing Date. A copy of such Tax Return shall be provided to Purchaser within 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the filing thereof, and the Purchaser shall have the right to comment on each such Tax Return and suggest changes thereto in good faith, which the Seller shall incorporate therein. 

   ##### 

  

 

For purposes of this Section 8.3(d) and Section 8.3(e), the term "Subsidiary"
shall mean any entity characterized as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes regardless of the percentage of the Sellers
ownership interest therein. 

   

 SECTION 8.4. _Cooperation; Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall:

 (e) execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Article VIII. 

  

 SECTION 8.5. _Refunds_. 

  

 (a) Any refunds (including interest thereon) of Taxes paid or indemnified by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(a) shall be for the account of the Seller. The Purchaser agrees to assign and promptly remit (and to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to assign and promptly remit) to the Seller all refunds (including interest thereon) of Taxes which the Seller is entitled to hereunder and which are received by the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate of the Purchaser. 

  

 (b) Any refunds (including interest thereon) of Taxes paid or indemnified by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(b) shall be for the account of the Purchaser. The Seller agrees to assign and promptly remit to the Purchaser all refunds (including interest thereon) of Taxes which the Purchaser is entitled to hereunder and which are received by the Seller or any of its Affiliates. 

  

 SECTION 8.6. _Disputes_. If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree on any calculation required to be made under this Article VIII, the Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly engage an independent accounting firm selected in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.3(d) to make such calculation as promptly as practicable, and to deliver a written notice to each of the Purchaser and the Seller setting forth the results of such calculation. The results of such calculation as made by such firm shall be final and binding, and the fees and expenses of such firm shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller. 

   #####

No party shall take any action (i) inconsistent with the treatment of this transaction as a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code or (ii) which would otherwise make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code unavailable. 

  

 (b) The Seller shall prepare and provide to the Purchaser drafts of IRS Form 8023 ( _Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases_) and any similar state and local forms at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser three originals of Form 8023 and any similar state or local forms executed by the Seller and such forms shall executed by the Purchaser on or prior to Closing. The Purchaser shall retain one executed original, and the Seller shall retain two executed originals, of the fully executed Form 8023 and any similar state or local forms.

The Purchaser and the Seller shall file Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and Form 8883 and any other state, local and foreign forms required for the Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. The parties agree not to take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule for Tax reporting purposes.

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 12.3. _Purchaser s Indemnification Obligations_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, members, employees and agents (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in Article VI, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or (c) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement, but only to the extent that such agreement or covenant is required to be performed after Closing; _provided_ , that in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, notice of the applicable breach is given to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period specified in Section 12.1. 

  

 (b) Solely for purposes of the indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to this Article XII (including the calculation of Losses pursuant to Section 12.5), in order to determine whether a breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of the Purchaser or the Company has occurred, all Materiality Qualifications contained in any such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant shall be disregarded. 

  

 SECTION 12.4. _Third Party Claims; Procedures_. 

  

 (a) If any Third Party asserts a Claim (a "Third-Party Claim") against an Indemnified Party that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right on the part of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this Article XII, the Indemnified Party shall give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable (but in no event later than fifteen Business Days after receiving notice of such Third-Party Claim or otherwise acquiring actual knowledge of the assertion thereof); _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 (b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim and shall retain counsel of its choice, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the relevant Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with such Legal Proceeding, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel. The Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Legal Proceeding; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings and, so long as it diligently pursues such defense, shall have full control of such defense and such proceedings, and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in connection with such Legal Proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties who are parties to such Legal Proceeding and are entitled to indemnification in respect thereof (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the terms of 

   ##### 

  

    

such settlement provide for no relief other than the payment of monetary
damages for which the relevant Indemnified Parties will be indemnified in
full. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) above which grant to the Indemnifying Party the right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, if (i) the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense or fails to assume the defense in a timely manner, (ii) the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party are both parties to such Legal Proceeding and a conflict of interests exists between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party which has the potential of materially and adversely affecting the interests of the Indemnified Party in the defense of such Legal Proceeding or (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines in good faith that the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could be adversely affected in any material respect in such Legal Proceeding other than as a result of monetary damages, then the Indemnified Party may employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent or defend it against any such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or separate but substantially similar Legal Proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnified Persons, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against such Legal Proceeding. If the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to and consulting with the Indemnified Party and its counsel about the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to a Third-Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 (a) The Seller shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for Losses of the type identified in clause (a) of Section 12.2 (excluding Losses that arise from a breach of any Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation) or clauses (b) or (c) of Section 12.2 (other than Losses arising from a breach of any covenants or agreements to be performed by the Seller after the Closing) ("Purchaser Covered Losses"), except to the extent that (i) the Purchaser Covered Loss arising from any specific breach exceeds $50,000 (the "Per Occurrence Basket"), in which case the Seller shall (subject to the other limitations contained elsewhere in this Section 12.5, including the limitation provided for in clause (ii) below) be liable under this Article XII for the entire amount of such Covered Loss arising from the applicable breach (including the portion that is less than the Per Occurrence Basket) and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Purchaser Covered Losses exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Aggregate Basket"), in which case the Seller shall be liable under this Article XII only for Purchaser Covered Losses which exceed the Aggregate Basket; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the limitation on indemnification set forth in this paragraph (a) shall not apply to any Losses resulting from breaches of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations, Tax Representations or Losses resulting from breaches of 

   ##### 

  

    

covenants or agreements to be performed after the Closing Date (including
Section 7.9(i) and (j)). 

  

 (b) The maximum obligation of the Seller to provide indemnification for all Purchaser Covered Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, together with that portion of all Losses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with any New Contractual Disputes for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 7.16 (unless excluded pursuant to the notice described in Section 7.16(d)), shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to $40,000,000;  _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the limitation on indemnification set forth in this paragraph (b) shall not apply to any Losses resulting from breaches of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations, the Tax Representations or breaches of covenants or agreements to be performed after the Closing Date (including Section 7.9(i) and (j)). 

  

 (c) The Purchaser shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for Losses of the type identified in clause (a) of Section 12.3 (other than Losses that arise from a breach of a Fundamental Representation) or clauses (b) or (c) of Section 12.3 (other than Losses arising from breaches of covenants or agreements to be performed after the Closing) ("Seller Covered Losses"), except to the extent that (i) the Seller Covered Loss arising from any specific breach exceeds the Per Occurrence Basket, in which case the Purchaser shall (subject to the other limitations contained elsewhere in this Section 12.5, including the limitation provided for in clause (ii) below) be liable under this Article XII for the entire amount of such Seller Covered Loss arising from the applicable breach (including the portion that is less than the Per Occurrence Basket) and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Seller Covered Losses exceeds the Aggregate Basket, in which case the Purchaser shall be liable under this Article XII only for Seller Covered Losses which exceed the Aggregate Basket; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, the limitation on indemnification set forth in this paragraph (c) shall not apply to any Losses for which the Purchaser is responsible pursuant to the terms of Section 7.16 or Losses resulting from breaches of covenants and agreements to be performed after the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) No member of the Seller Group shall have any rights of subrogation or similar rights with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on and following the Closing Date in connection with any indemnification obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XII, any amount payable by Seller pursuant to Section 12.2 in respect of any Losses shall be decreased by the full amount of any reserve or accrual in respect of such Losses reflected on the Final Balance Sheet. 

  

 SECTION 12.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law (pursuant to statutory or other provisions that cannot be waived by the parties), from and after the Closing, the provisions contained herein with respect to the final determination and payment of the Purchase Price (including the provisions of Sections 1.4 and 3.3) and the provisions of Article VIII and this Article XII shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for all matters covered or contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the right of any party to seek specific performance or injunctive relief in connection with a breach by another party of its 

   ##### 

  

    

obligations under this Agreement that occurs after the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby expressly
agrees that (a) the Purchasers sole remedy for breaches by the Seller or the
Company of representations and warranties set forth in Articles IV and V
(including pursuant to Section 9.3) and any covenants to be performed prior
to Closing shall be the indemnification claims and rights set forth in
Section 12.2 (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.5), and
neither the Seller nor the Company shall have any other or additional
liability to the Purchaser arising out of or related to any breach by the
Seller or the Company of any of the representations and warranties set forth
in Articles IV and V (including pursuant to Section 9.3) or any covenants to
be performed prior to Closing, and (b) the Purchaser shall not seek any
indemnification, contribution, repayment or other remedy or recourse directly
or indirectly (through any director or officer of the Company or the Seller
or otherwise) from the Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any matter
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
operations, properties or assets (including any matters relating to the
merchantability, value or use of any such properties or assets) or the subject
matter of this Agreement (whether on the basis of a claim sounding in tort,
contract, statute or otherwise) outside of the provisions of Article VIII and
this Article XII. In no event shall any party be liable for special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages,
lost profits, diminution in value, damage to reputation or loss to goodwill,
whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise. The Guarantor
expressly acknowledges the provisions of this Section 12.6 and agrees to be
subject to such provisions in the same manner and to the same extent as the
Purchaser. 

  

 SECTION 12.7. _Mitigation; Insurance_. In the case of any Third-Party Claims that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under Article XII, if there is a reasonable likelihood that such Indemnified Party may have a direct or indirect right of recovery against one or more Third Parties (including rights of recovery under insurance policies or indemnification arrangements with subcontractors or other Third Parties), (i) the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such right of recovery, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall pursue enforcement of such right of recovery for so long as the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, consistent with past practice, that the pursuit thereof is commercially reasonable, using the same degree of effort and otherwise in a manner consistent with the practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the three year period prior to the Closing Date and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of such right of recovery as contemplated by clause (ii) above; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall it be a prerequisite to making any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article XII or a condition to the obligations of the Indemnifying Party in respect of any such claim that the Indemnified Party shall have successfully enforced any right of recovery against a Third Party. To the extent that an Indemnified Party obtains recovery in respect of any such Third-Party Claims from any Third Parties, the amount of any Losses with respect to any Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is available under this Article XII shall be reduced by the amount of such insurance proceeds or other such funds realized or paid to the Indemnified Party, net of any applicable deductible or self-insurance retention and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery. If, after the making of any payment in respect of a Third-Party Claim under this Article XII, the amount of the Losses to which such payment relates is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, 

   ##### 

  

    

settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such
reduction will promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party, net of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by such
party in obtaining such recovery. Each Indemnified Party shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses. 

  

 SECTION 12.8. _Cooperation; Access to Documents and Information_. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with resolving any Claims (including, Third-Party Claims) as to which indemnification is or may be required to be provided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Indemnified Party who desires to assert a Claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party, (i) provide to the Indemnifying Party all documents and information relating to such Claim which are in the possession of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or can be obtained by the Indemnified Party without undue cost or expense as promptly as practicable and (ii) give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the accounting and other appropriate personnel and the independent accountants of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates in order to permit the Indemnifying Party to obtain information reasonably required to evaluate such Claim.

PARENT GUARANTEE

    

 SECTION 14.1. _Guarantee_. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, for the benefit of the Seller, the due and punctual payment in full of all payment obligations and the 

   ##### 

  

 

performance of all other obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, (i) the obligation of the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and pay the Initial Purchase
Price to the Seller at the Closing, (ii) the obligation of the Purchaser to
make the Additional Payments to the Seller and (iii) the obligation of the
Purchaser to make any indemnification payments to the Seller or any other
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.11 or Articles VIII and XII
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"), in each case in accordance with
and subject to the terms hereof. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that
the guarantee granted pursuant to this Article XIV (the "Guarantee")
constitutes an unconditional guarantee of payment and performance and
irrevocably waives any right to require that any resort be had to the
Purchaser or any other Person or any security held for payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, to any other guarantor or to any fund or account as a
condition to the enforcement of this Guarantee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Guarantor shall not be required to pay or perform any
Guaranteed Obligation hereunder unless and until there has been a failure to
pay or perform by the Purchaser with respect to such obligation in accordance
with this Agreement and the Seller shall have given written notice or demand
to the Purchaser of such failure; _provided, however,_ that (i) the
provisions of this sentence shall not be construed to require that the
Seller take any action to enforce its rights against the Purchaser (other
than giving the notice or demand provided for above) prior to seeking
enforcement of this Guarantee and (ii) the requirement that the Seller
provide prior written notice or demand to the Purchaser shall not apply if the
giving of such notice or demand is prohibited by law or the Seller reasonably
determines in good faith that complying or attempting to comply with such
requirement would reasonably be expected to jeopardize its ability to enforce
the Guarantee. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Guarantor also waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to
the Purchaser with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives
notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment,
except to the extent the Purchaser is entitled to the same under the express
terms of this Agreement. This Guarantee creates a primary obligation of the
Guarantor, and the Guarantor shall perform its obligations hereunder whether
or not the Purchaser would otherwise have the power or right to do so.
Accordingly, if the Purchaser should fail to comply with any of its
obligations set forth in this Agreement for any reason, the Guarantor shall
be responsible therefor and hereby agrees to perform such obligations
unconditionally without regard to any defense or other basis for
nonperformance that it would otherwise have or be entitled to claim, except
that the Guarantor shall be entitled to assert any and all defenses that would
be available to the Purchaser in an action brought by the Seller against the
Purchaser to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations, other than any defense that
(i) arises as a result of facts or circumstances giving rise to a breach of
or inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or (ii) arises as a result of the voluntary
or involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Purchaser, the sale of all
or substantially all of the properties, assets or liabilities of the
Purchaser, the appointment of a trustee, custodian, receiver, liquidator,
sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of the properties or
assets of the Purchaser, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, composition,
readjustment or other similar Legal Proceedings affecting the Purchaser or is
provided for under any Law providing for relief of debtors in connection with
any such Legal Proceedings. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 14.2. _Unconditional Guarantee_. Without limiting the provisions of Section 14.1, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder are absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances, and such obligations shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination, to any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, or, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to any defense, setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations, the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Purchaser, the sale of all or substantially all of the properties, assets or liabilities of the Purchaser, the appointment of a trustee, custodian, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of the properties or assets of the Purchaser, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, composition, readjustment or other similar Legal Proceedings affecting the Purchaser, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of the Purchaser from the payment or performance of its obligations under this Agreement by operation of Law in the event of any such Legal Proceeding with respect to the Purchaser or its properties or assets, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of the Purchaser or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under this Agreement or any other documents entered into from time to time in connection therewith in the event of any such Legal Proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by any act or omission or delay to do any act which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor or which would otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of Law. 

  

 SECTION 14.3. _Effect of Amendments to Guaranteed Obligations_. The Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be amended, extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it and it will remain bound by its guarantee notwithstanding any amendment, extension or renewal of the Guaranteed Obligations, including agreements and arrangements for payment, extension, subordination, composition, arrangement, discharge or release of the whole or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or for compromise, whether by way of acceptance of partial payment or otherwise, and the same shall in no way impair Guarantors liability hereunder. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of Guarantor under this Article XIV except the full and indefeasible performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; _provided, however_ , that if the Seller executes a written instrument waiving enforcement of any Guaranteed Obligation against the Purchaser, the Seller shall not be entitled to seek enforcement of such obligation against the Guarantor to the extent rights of enforcement are waived pursuant to such instrument. 

  

 SECTION 14.4. _Effectiveness and Reinstatement of Guarantee_. The Guarantor further agrees that this Guarantee shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Seller in connection with the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Purchaser or any other Legal Proceeding referred to in Section 14.2, or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 14.5. _Subrogation; Subordination_. Until the date upon which all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid or performed in full, (a) the 

   ##### 

  

    

Guarantor shall not exercise any subrogation, contribution, indemnity or any
other right to enforce any other remedy which the Guarantor now or hereafter
shall have against the Purchaser by reason of any one or more payments or
acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder
or otherwise and (b) the Guarantor hereby agrees that all rights and claims of
the Guarantor described in clause (a) of this Section 14.5, shall be
subordinated to the prior indefeasible payment and performance in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations due and payable hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 14.6. _Obligation Currency_. All obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be payable in United States dollars. The obligations hereunder of Guarantor to make payments in United States dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any other currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Seller of the full amount of in United States dollars owing to it hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 14.7. _Representations and Warranties of the Guarantor_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Seller as follows: 

  

 (a) The Guarantor is a corporation validly existing under the laws of England and Wales. 

  

 (b) The Guarantor has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder.

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Guarantor, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor and is enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. 

  

 (c) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of this Agreement and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations hereunder will not (i) result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Guarantor, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default under, any term or provision of any Contract, franchise, permit, license or other instrument or document to which the Guarantor is a party or by which its properties or assets are bound or (iii) result in any violation of any Law or any Order applicable to the Guarantor or its properties or assets, except for any of the matters referred to in clauses (ii) or (iii) above which would not reasonably be expected to affect in any material respect the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 (d) There is no requirement applicable to the Guarantor to obtain any Consent of, or to make or effect any declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Authority or other Person for the valid execution and delivery by the Guarantor of this Agreement or the due performance by the Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, except for any requirement which, if not satisfied, would not reasonably be expected to affect in any material respect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against the Guarantor or to which the Guarantor is a party that relate to this Agreement or any obligation of the Guarantor hereunder. 

  

 (f) The Purchaser is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Guarantor, and the Guarantor expects to derive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the acquisition of the Shares by the Purchaser and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby, which benefits are at least equal to the obligations undertaken by Guarantor pursuant to this Article XIV. The Guarantor directly or indirectly controls the business and affairs of the Purchaser. Based on the facts described above, the Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into this Guarantee.

 SECTION 14.9. _Binding Effect; Benefits_. This Guarantee shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Seller and its successors and assigns.

 SECTION 14.10. _Costs of Enforcement_. If a judgment is obtained against Guarantor with respect to a dispute arising pursuant to this Guarantee, reasonable attorneys fees and actual costs shall be included in such judgment. 

  

 SECTION 14.11. _Other Provisions_. The provisions contained in Article XV shall apply to the Guarantee, except to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this Article XIV, in which case the provisions of this Article XIV shall govern.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder (including under Article XIV) may be assigned without the written consent of the other parties; _provided, however_ , that the Seller shall be expressly entitled, without the consent of any other party, to assign its rights to indemnification and any other rights and benefits provided to it under Section 7.11(b) (and any related rights set forth in Article XIV) to Merrill Lynch, and any such assignee will be entitled to enforce such rights in the same manner and to the same extent as the Seller. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to the provisions of Section 7.10) and the Indemnified Parties (with respect to the provisions of Article XII) and the Persons referred to in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no other Person shall be deemed a third-party beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 15.5. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 15.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations, understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof that are not fully expressed in this Agreement and the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith. All Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules attached to this Agreement are expressly made a part of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 15.7. _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware for contracts made and to be fully performed in such state, without giving effect to any choice-of-law rules that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The parties agree that, subject to Section 15.9, any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in federal district court in the Northern District of Texas or, if such federal district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applicable matter, any Texas state court located in Dallas County, Texas. 

  

 (c) Each of the parties: (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the Northern District of Texas or, if such federal district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applicable matter, any Texas state court located in Dallas County, Texas; (ii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iii) agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than a federal district court located in the Northern District of Texas or, if such federal district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applicable matter, any Texas state court located in Dallas County, Texas; and (iv) agrees that it will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) any such Legal Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 (d) Each party acknowledges that it is the intention of the parties that any Legal Proceeding of the type referred to in paragraph (b) will be brought in the federal district court located in the Northern District of Texas, if such court has subject matter jurisdiction, and agrees that it shall not challenge the existence of diversity jurisdiction or participate with any other Person in challenging the existence of diversity jurisdiction and shall not take any action or omit to take any action that would have the effect of challenging the existence of diversity jurisdiction. If the parties have complied with paragraphs (a)-(c) of this Section 15.7, but a Legal Proceeding of the type referred to in paragraph (b) is transferred from the Northern District of Texas to a United States federal court outside that District, following the transfer, the provisions of this Section 15.7 shall apply as if the Legal Proceeding were in federal district court in the Northern District of Texas. 

  

 (e) Process in any Legal Proceeding of the type referred to in paragraph (b) may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller, Purchaser and Guarantor agree that notice to any party that is not a resident of the United States by the method set forth in Section 15.3 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party in any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 15.8. _Remedies_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the proper and legitimate interests of the other parties hereto and (ii) the other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to 

   ##### 

  

    

prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by other parties hereto
without the necessity of proving actual damages or of posting any bond, and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, which rights shall
be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto
may be entitled hereunder or at law or equity. 

  

 SECTION 15.9. _Mandatory Mediation of Certain Disputes_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, if any dispute arises between the parties in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "Dispute"), subject to clause (e) below, neither party shall initiate litigation or any other Legal Proceeding until the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 15.9 have been exhausted. All communications or negotiations pursuant to this Section 15.9 are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and applicable state rules of evidence. 

  

 (b) Any party shall give notice of a Dispute by the method set forth in Section 15.3. The notice shall describe the nature of the Dispute and any proposed remedy (the "Dispute Notice"). If such notice is given, the parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the Dispute. The executives shall confer within ten days following receipt of the Dispute Notice in person or by telephone. The parties shall work together in good faith to resolve the Dispute in this manner. 

  

 (c) If the parties do not resolve the Dispute within 30 days following receipt of the Dispute Notice, then the Dispute shall be submitted to mediation. Any party shall initiate mediation of the Dispute by notifying each other party by the method set forth in Section 15.3 that mediation is demanded. Following such notice, the Dispute shall be submitted to mediation administered by the CPR International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution under its Mediation Procedures (except as such procedures are modified by the provisions of this Section 15.9(c)), or, upon the agreement of all parties, by any other entity or person offering mediation services. No person shall serve as a mediator in any Dispute in which the person has any financial or personal interest in the result of the mediation, except by the written consent of all parties. Before accepting any appointment, the prospective mediator shall disclose any circumstances likely to create a presumption of bias or to prevent a prompt meeting with the parties. 

   

 (i) Unless the parties agree otherwise, within 10 days following the selection of the mediator, each party shall submit to the mediator a confidential "mediator-eyes only" letter concisely describing its position regarding the issues that need to be resolved ("Position Statement"). Unless the parties agree otherwise, the mediation shall be commenced within 10 days following the submission of all Position Statements and shall be concluded within 10 days from the commencement of the mediation. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the mediation shall be held in Dallas, Texas. 

   

 (ii) The mediator has discretion to conduct the mediation in the manner in which the mediator believes is most appropriate for reaching a settlement of the Dispute. The mediator is authorized to conduct joint and separate meetings with the 

   ##### 

  

    

parties and to make oral and written recommendations for settlement. The
mediator shall not have the authority to impose a settlement on the parties,
but will attempt to help them reach a satisfactory resolution of their
Dispute. 

   

 (iii) Confidential information disclosed to a mediator in the course of the mediation shall remain confidential throughout and after the mediation. 

   

 (iv) Each party to the mediation shall bear its own attorneys fees and costs in connection with such mediation. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the fees and costs charged by the mediator or the organization administering the mediation shall be divided equally among all the parties to the mediation. 

  

 (d) If and only if the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days following the conclusion of the mediation, any party may initiate a Legal Proceeding regarding the Dispute, subject to the provisions in section 15.7. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 15.9 will not be construed to prevent a party from (i) seeking a temporary restraining order or injunctive or other equitable relief hereunder or (ii) instituting litigation or other appropriate proceedings to the extent necessary to avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period or to preserve a superior position with respect to creditors. 

  

 SECTION 15.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear its own expenses (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants and other experts) incurred by it in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, each of the other documents and instruments executed in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall pay the expenses described in Section 15.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 SECTION 15.11. _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date each party hereto shall take such other actions and execute such other documents and instruments reasonably requested by the other parties as are reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement, including the conveyance and transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 15.12. _Release of Information_. The parties shall cooperate with each other in releasing information concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. No press releases or other public announcements concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by any party without prior consultation with, and agreement of, the other parties, except for any legally required communication by any party and then only with prior consultation with the other party. 

  

 SECTION 15.13. _Disclosure Schedules_. For purposes of the representations and warranties of each party contained herein, disclosure in any section of a Disclosure Schedule delivered by such party of any facts or circumstances shall not be deemed to be adequate disclosure of such facts or circumstances with respect to any other representations 

   ##### 

  

    

or warranties made by such party, unless (i) such disclosure is specifically
identified or purports to respond to (whether by specific cross-reference or
otherwise) one or more of such other representations and warranties or (ii)
with respect to any specific item of the relevant Disclosure Schedule, a
reasonable person would be reasonably likely to conclude that a matter
disclosed on such item of such Disclosure Schedule is responsive to matters
to be disclosed on another item of such Disclosure Schedule. Any information
provided in a Disclosure Schedule (other than the Allocation Schedule or
Sections 7.11(c) and 7.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
reflect agreements among the parties hereto) is solely for informational
purposes, and the inclusion of such information shall not be deemed to
enlarge or enhance any of the representations or warranties of the party
providing the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise
alter in any way the terms of this Agreement. The inclusion of any
information in any section of the Disclosure Schedule or other document
delivered by the parties pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed to be
an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it
establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever. 

  

 SECTION 15.14. _Certain Rules of Construction_. The article and section headings and the table of contents, and the recitals (except to the extent terms are expressly defined therein) contained in this Agreement are illustrative and for convenience of reference only and shall in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope or intent of any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. In addition, as used in this Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the contrary, (a) all references to days, months or years shall be deemed references to calendar days, months or years or (b) any reference to a "Section," "Article" or "Exhibit" shall be deemed to refer to a section or article of this Agreement, a Disclosure Schedule or an exhibit attached to this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes," or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Whenever this Agreement refers to an event, occurrence or development that "would reasonably be expected to have" or "would not reasonably be expected to have" a specified effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person (including a Material Adverse Effect) a determination as to whether such effect would reasonably be expected to occur shall be made from the viewpoint of a reasonable and objective third party as of the date of such event, occurrence or development that is experienced in the contracting and construction services industry, and not from the viewpoint of, or taking into account any special circumstances applicable to, any particular Person (including the Purchaser). 

  

 SECTION 15.15. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original (whether such counterpart is originally executed or an electronic copy of an original) and all of which taken together shall constitute one instrument binding on all the parties, notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart.

Exhibit A 

   

FORM OF 

   

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT 

   

 This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of ___, 2007 (the "Effective Date") by and between CENTEX SERVICE COMPANY LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("Service Co."), and CENTEX CONSTRUCTION GROUP, INC., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, on January ___, 2007, the Company, Centex Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the "Seller"), Balfour Beatty, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"), and Balfour Beatty plc, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company to the Purchaser; 

  

 WHEREAS, on the date hereof, the Seller and the Purchaser are consummating the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, certain business operations of the Company have been supported by functions and services provided by the Seller or its Affiliates (including Service Co.), and Service Co. is willing to continue to provide certain of such services to the Company for an interim period, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the terms and conditions set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Service Co. agree as follows: 

  

 SECTION 1. _Definitions; Rules of Construction_. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:

 "Company" has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Agreement. 

  

 "Effective Date" has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Agreement. 

  

 "Invoice" has the meaning specified in Section 4.3 of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 "Partial Termination" has the meaning specified in Section 8.2 of this Agreement. 

  

 "Party" shall mean the Company or Service Co. 

  

 "Purchase Agreement" has the meaning specified in the recitals to this Agreement. 

  

 "Purchaser" has the meaning specified in the recitals to this Agreement. 

  

 "Seller" has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Agreement. 

  

 "Service Fees" has the meaning specified in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. 

  

 "Services" shall mean all services described in _Exhibit A_ that are to be provided by Service Co. pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Services shall not include any services which are not being provided by Seller or its Affiliates on the date hereof, unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing and a mutually agreeable adjustment is made to the payment to be made to Service Co. pursuant to Section 4. 

  

 "Term" has the meaning specified in Section 2 of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 2. _Term_. Service Co. agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Services to the Company during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2007 (the "Term"), unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms hereof; _provided, however_ , that, in the case of any Service that, in accordance with _Exhibit A_, is scheduled to be provided for a different period or until a specified date set forth therein, Service Co. shall provide such Service during such period or until such date. 

  

 SECTION 3. _Performance of Services._  

   

 3.1 _General_. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Service Co. shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Services to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Unless specifically provided to the contrary in _Exhibit A_, all Services provided for under this Agreement shall be performed or provided, as applicable, in substantially the same manner as those Services have been provided to the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date and in a manner consistent with the usual and customary practices of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that neither Service Co. nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any Losses or other consequences arising from the inability or failure on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide the Services for itself or to arrange for replacement services to be provided by Third Parties, in either case, from and after the expiration of the Term. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.2 _Partial Expiration or Termination_. As described in _Exhibit A_, Service Co.s obligation to provide certain services shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Term if the Company is able to provide such services for itself or arrange replacement services to be provided by Third Parties on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. If a Partial Termination occurs, Service Co. and its Affiliates shall no longer provide any Services which are the subject of such Partial Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither a partial expiration of services nor a Partial Termination shall have any effect on other Services provided by Service Co. or its Affiliates hereunder and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Services which have not been expired or terminated by the Company as provided herein. 

  

 3.3 _Third Party Consents_. Service Co. shall be responsible for obtaining any Consents from Third Parties necessary to provide the Services under this Agreement. The Company shall be responsible for obtaining any Consents from Third Parties to use and access any software, hardware, databases, data or other third-party property or materials to be used by the Company and its Subsidiaries to replace any Services after the expiration of the Term. 

  

 3.4 _No Implied Representations_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, neither Service Co. nor any of its Affiliates makes any express or implied representations, warranties or guarantees relating to the Services to be performed under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 

  

 3.5 _Subcontracting_. If Seller or Service Co., as applicable, subcontracts or outsources any intercompany services it provides to its Affiliates generally, to the extent the Services provided hereunder are affected, the Company agrees to cooperate in good faith with the reasonable request of the Seller and Service Co. to reach arrangements with such third-party subcontractor or service provider for the provision of the Services to the Company and its Subsidiaries by such third-party directly. Nothing herein shall prevent Service Co. from subcontracting its obligations hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 4. _Fees; Costs and Expenses_. 

  

 4.1. _Service Fees._ In consideration of the provision of the Services, the Company shall pay to Service Co. the fees described in _Exhibit A_ (the "Service Fees"). If the Company terminates any Service prior to the end of a monthly period and the Service Fee therefor is not based on usage, such Service Fee for the monthly period in which the termination date occurs shall be determined by multiplying the amount of such Service Fee by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such monthly period during which the Services were provided and the denominator of which is the number of days in such monthly period. 

  

 4.2. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. In addition, the Company shall pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses due to Third Parties associated with the performance of the Services, including the cost of special order supplies and reasonable expenses of travel made pursuant to the Companys request. To the extent that any such out-of-pocket costs 

   ##### 

  

 

and expenses are paid by Service Co. or its Affiliates, the Company shall
reimburse Service Co. for all such out-of-pocket expenses. 

   

 4.3. _Invoices; Payment_. Promptly after the end of each month, Service Co. shall prepare and deliver to the Company an invoice for the Service Fees and out of pocket costs and expenses applicable to such month (an "Invoice"). All amounts reflected in the Invoice shall be due and payable 30 calendar days following receipt by the Company of the Invoice. Any amount not paid on or before the date such amount is due shall bear interest from and after such date until paid in full a rate equal to 8.00% per annum. Unless otherwise specified in _Exhibit B_ or mutually agreed by the Parties, all payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars. 

  

 4.4. _Taxes_. Each Party shall be responsible for (i) any real or personal property Taxes on property it owns or leases, (ii) franchise and similar Taxes on its business, (iii) the employment Taxes of its employees and (iv) Taxes based on its net income. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be responsible for all Taxes in connection with this Agreement, including any sales, use, excise, value-added, services, consumption and other Taxes assessed on the provision of Services by Service Co. or its Affiliates to the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the Service Fees and other charges to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, and on any goods or Services used or consumed by either Party in connection with the provision of Services under this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 5. _Force Majeure_. Neither Service Co. nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible or liable to the Company or its Affiliates for any delay or failure to perform under this Agreement due to circumstances beyond its control, including any acts of God, acts of any Governmental Authority or military authority, fires, explosions, power failures, telecommunications service failures, floods, storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, elements of nature, epidemics, riots or civil disturbances, wars, sabotage, terrorism, rebellions or revolutions or similar events and any delays or failures caused by the nonperformance of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the nonperformance of any Third Party under the control or responsibility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Seller will promptly notify the Company in writing upon learning of the occurrence of such event of force majeure. Upon the cessation of the force majeure event, Seller and its Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to resume their performance as promptly as practicable. 

  

 SECTION 6. _Confidentiality._ Service Co. recognizes that, by reason of performing the Services pursuant to this Agreement, Service Co. will acquire proprietary, secret or confidential information concerning the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Similarly, the Company recognizes that, by reason of receiving the Services pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will acquire proprietary, secret or confidential information concerning the business and operations of Service Co. and its Affiliates. Accordingly, (i) Service Co. covenants to the Company that Service Co. will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, for a period of three years following the Effective Date, except in performance of the terms of this Agreement, in connection with the enforcement of its rights under this Agreement or with the prior written consent of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company, disclose to any Third Party any proprietary, secret or confidential
information obtained in the course of performing the Services hereunder
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses
and operations and (ii) the Company covenants to Service Co. that the Company
will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, for a period of
three years following the Effective Date, except in the performance of the
terms of this Agreement, in connection with the enforcement of its rights
under this Agreement or with the prior written consent of Service Co.,
disclose to any Third Party any proprietary, secret or
confidential information obtained in connection with this Agreement relating
to Service Co. or its Affiliates or their respective businesses and
operations. The foregoing obligations of each Party shall not apply to any
information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by such Party or its Affiliates, (ii) it is
known by reason of ownership or operation of a business (owned or operated as
of the date hereof) other than that of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(iii) is to be disclosed by such Party as required by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 7. _Relationship of the Parties_. In connection with this Agreement, each Party is acting as a principal or an independent contractor and, as such, shall not have any authority to bind or commit the other Party. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or construed to create a joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between the Parties for any purpose. The Parties are not joint employers for any purpose, and Service Co. and its Affiliates (or their subcontractors) will have the sole right to exercise all authority with respect to the employment (including termination of employment), assignment and compensation of its employees and representatives providing Services hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 8. _Termination_. 

  

 8.1 _General_. This Agreement shall terminate, and the obligation of Service Co. and its Affiliates to provide all Services shall cease, on the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the Term, (ii) the date on which all Services have been terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2 or (iii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.3. 

  

 8.2 _Partial Termination_. The Company may terminate all or a portion of the Services provided hereunder upon at least 15 days prior written notice to Service Co. if it determines in its sole discretion that such Services are no longer desired (a "Partial Termination"). 

  

 8.3 _Termination of Entire Agreement_. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon delivery of written notice to the other Party if the other Party: (a) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or is the subject of a petition in bankruptcy, or takes advantage of any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency act, or if a receiver or receiver/manager is appointed for all or any substantial part of its property and business and such receiver or receiver/manager remains undischarged for a period of 15 days or (b) materially defaults in the performance of any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement and such default is not remedied to 

   ##### 

  

 

the nondefaulting Partys reasonable satisfaction within 15 days after notice
to the defaulting Party of such default. 

   

 8.4 _Procedures on Termination_. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Company shall promptly pay Service Co. for all Services provided and all Service Fees and other charges due pursuant to Section 4, through the effective date of such expiration or termination.

 9.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Service Co. and its Affiliates from and against all Losses incurred by Service Co. or its Affiliates based upon or arising from any third-party Claim relating to the performance of the Services (regardless of whether such Losses arise from the negligence of other fault of Service Co. or any of its Affiliates), except to the extent that such damages are determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or a mediator pursuant to Section 15.9 of the Purchase Agreement to arise out of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Service Co. or any of its Affiliates. 

  

 9.2 _Limitation on Liability_.

 (b) If either Party becomes liable to the other Party for or in connection with any matter relating to or arising from this Agreement, whether based upon an action or claim in contract, warranty, equity, negligence, intended conduct or otherwise, the aggregate amount of damages recoverable against the liable Party with respect to any and all breaches, performance, nonperformance, acts or omissions hereunder will not exceed an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Service Fees paid hereunder. 

  

 (c) In no event shall either Party be liable for consequential, indirect, incidental, exemplary or punitive damages (including, without limitation, damages due to business interruption or lost profits, savings, competitive advantage or goodwill) arising from or related to this Agreement, regardless of the type of claim, whether in contract, warranty, equity, negligence, intended conduct or otherwise and regardless of the cause of such damages even if such damages were foreseeable.
