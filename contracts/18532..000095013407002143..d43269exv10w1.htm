the Seller to review the Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing
Payment Amount; <I>provided, however, </I>that if required by the independent accountants of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, such independent accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers
or other records available to the Seller unless and until the Seller has signed a customary

acceptable to such accountants. The calculation of the Adjusted Pre-Closing Payment Amount set
forth in the Final CFO Certificate shall be binding upon each of the parties, unless the Seller
objects to such calculation in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.3(a).

performed by the Final Arbiter. The determination of the Final Arbiter, and the resulting

absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Final Arbiter shall be borne equally
by the Purchaser and the Seller.

Agreement shall mean the Final Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.2, as modified to

limited to, (i)&nbsp;the obligation of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and pay the Initial Purchase Price to the Seller at the Closing, (ii)&nbsp;the obligation of the
Purchaser to make the Additional Payments to the Seller and (iii)&nbsp;the obligation of the Purchaser
to make any indemnification payments to the Seller or any other Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section&nbsp;7.11 or Articles VIII and XII (collectively, the &#147;<B>Guaranteed Obligations</B>&#148;), in each case
in accordance with and subject to the terms hereof. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the
guarantee granted pursuant to this Article&nbsp;XIV (the &#147;<B>Guarantee</B>&#148;) constitutes an unconditional
guarantee of payment and performance and irrevocably waives any right to require that any resort be
had to the Purchaser or any other Person or any security held for payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, to any other guarantor or to any fund or account as a condition to the enforcement of
this Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantor shall not be required to pay or
perform any Guaranteed Obligation hereunder unless and until there has been a failure to pay or
perform by the Purchaser with respect to such obligation in accordance with this Agreement and the
Seller shall have given written notice or demand to the Purchaser of such failure; <I>provided,
however, </I>that (i)&nbsp;the provisions of this sentence shall not be construed to require that the Seller
take any action to enforce its rights against the Purchaser (other than giving the notice or demand
provided for above) prior to seeking enforcement of this Guarantee and (ii)&nbsp;the requirement that
the Seller provide prior written notice or demand to the Purchaser shall not apply if the giving of
such notice or demand is prohibited by law or the Seller reasonably determines in good faith that
complying or attempting to comply with such requirement would reasonably be expected to jeopardize
its ability to enforce the Guarantee. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
the Guarantor also waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Purchaser with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and
notice of protest for nonpayment, except to the extent the Purchaser is entitled to the same under
the express terms of this Agreement. This Guarantee creates a primary obligation of the Guarantor,
and the Guarantor shall perform its obligations hereunder whether or not the Purchaser would
otherwise have the power or right to do so. Accordingly, if the Purchaser should fail to comply
with any of its obligations set forth in this Agreement for any reason, the Guarantor shall be
responsible therefor and hereby agrees to perform such obligations unconditionally without regard
to any defense or other basis for nonperformance that it would otherwise have or be entitled to
claim, except that the Guarantor shall be entitled to assert any and all defenses that would be
available to the Purchaser in an action brought by the Seller against the Purchaser to enforce the
Guaranteed Obligations, other than any defense that (i)&nbsp;arises as a result of facts or
circumstances giving rise to a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties
of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;arises as a result of the voluntary or
involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Purchaser, the sale of all or substantially all of
the properties, assets or liabilities of the Purchaser, the appointment of a trustee, custodian,
receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of the properties or assets
of the Purchaser, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, composition, readjustment or other similar Legal
Proceedings affecting the Purchaser or is provided for under any Law providing for relief of
debtors in connection with any such Legal Proceedings.

to any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, or, to the fullest extent

extension or renewal of the Guaranteed Obligations, including agreements and arrangements for
payment, extension, subordination, composition, arrangement, discharge or release of the whole or

indefeasible performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; <I>provided, however</I>, that if the
Seller executes a written instrument waiving enforcement of any Guaranteed Obligation against the
Purchaser, the Seller shall not be entitled to seek enforcement of such obligation against the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 <I>Partial Expiration or Termination</I>. As described in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U>, Service Co.&#146;s
obligation to provide certain services shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Term if the
Company is able to provide such services for itself or arrange replacement services to be provided
by Third Parties on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. If a Partial Termination occurs,
Service Co. and its Affiliates shall no longer provide any Services which are the subject of such
Partial Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither a partial expiration
of services nor a Partial Termination shall have any effect on other Services provided by Service
Co. or its Affiliates hereunder and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with

herein.

without limitation, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5 <I>Subcontracting</I>. If Seller or Service Co., as applicable, subcontracts or outsources any
intercompany services it provides to its Affiliates generally, to the extent the Services provided
hereunder are affected, the Company agrees to cooperate in good faith with the reasonable request
of the Seller and Service Co. to reach arrangements with such third-party subcontractor or service
provider for the provision of the Services to the Company and its Subsidiaries by such third-party
directly. Nothing herein shall prevent Service Co. from subcontracting its obligations hereunder.
