 Section 5.03 _Further Actions_. Each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby.

   #####

Such excess initially shall be paid to the Company no later than 30 days prior to the date on which the Tax Return with respect to the final liability for such Taxes is required to be filed. If the amount of such Taxes paid by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date exceeds the amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess within 30 days after the Tax Return with respect to the final liability for such Taxes is required to be filed. The payments to be made pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(iii)_ with respect to a Straddle Period shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution of Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to Straddle Period Taxes.

(a) For the time periods and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this _Article VIII_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend Seller and its successors and permitted assigns and each of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors and employees (individually a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses that are sustained or incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties and directly arise from, relate to, or result from any of the following:

 (iii) any Transfer Taxes in accordance with  _Section 9.04_. 

  

 (b) Purchasers obligations to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to  _Section 8.03(a)(i)_ shall be limited to claims for indemnification that are made in writing and received by Purchaser on or before the expiration of the applicable survival period referenced in _Section 8.01_.

    ##### 

  

 

Agreement to each Person from whom indemnification is being claimed (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "). Promptly after written notice of a claim has been
provided as set forth above, the Indemnified Party shall supply the
Indemnifying Party with all material information and documents it has in its
possession regarding such claim, together with all material information in
its possession regarding the amount of the Loss that it asserts it has
sustained or incurred, and shall provide reasonable access to the
Indemnifying Party to inspect such other records and books in the possession
of the Indemnified Party and relating to the claim and asserted Loss as the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request. The Indemnifying Party shall
have a period of 30 calendar days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
such notice and such evidence to either (i) agree to the payment of the Loss
to the Indemnified Party or (ii) contest the payment of the Loss. If
the Indemnifying Party does not agree to or contests the payment of the Loss
within such 30-day period, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to
have accepted the Loss and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to seek
a resolution of such dispute for a 30-day period and, if not resolved through
negotiations, then such dispute will be resolved in accordance with
_Section 11.03_ of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party agrees to the
payment of the Loss within such 30-day period, then it shall, within 10
Business Days after such agreement, pay to the Indemnified Party the amount
of the Loss that is payable pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set
forth in, this  _Article VIII_. Payment shall be effected by wire transfer
or transfers of immediately available funds from the Indemnifying Party to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the applicable Indemnified Party
to such Indemnifying Party. 

   

 Section 8.05 _Third Party Claims._  

   

 (a) Except with respect to claims related to Taxes covered by _Section 9.01(c)_, if any Action is instituted or threatened in writing by a third party against an Indemnified Party (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which an Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification for any Losses under this _Article VIII_, then such Indemnified Party shall give written notice to each Indemnifying Party promptly, and in any event no later than 10 Business Days after it has knowledge of a written assertion of liability from the third party and shall not make any admissions or acceptances; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnified Party shall supply the Indemnifying Party with all material information and documents as it has in its possession regarding such claim (including court papers), together with all material information in its possession regarding the amount of the Loss that it asserts it has sustained or incurred, and shall provide reasonable access to the Indemnifying Party to inspect such other records and books in the possession of the Indemnified Party and relating to the Third Party Claim and asserted Loss as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct and control, at its own expense, through counsel of its choosing, the defense of a Third Party Claim so long as (x) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it has agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Party (subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth herein) in respect of such Third Party Claim within 20 Business Days of its receipt of the initial notice of the Third Party Claim and (y) such third party claim is fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party (other than in respect of Losses applied to satisfy the Deductible in accordance with  _Section 8.06(a)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 

   ##### 

  

 

Article VIII, Seller shall have the sole right to control the defense of any
Third Party Claim (including any Action currently pending or threatened) with
respect to which an Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification for
any Losses under Section 8.02(a)(vii). 

   

 (c) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party to the fullest extent possible in regard to all matters relating to the Third Party Claim, including, without limitation, where the Indemnified Party has assumed the control of such Third Party Claim, with respect to corrective actions required by applicable Law, assertion of defenses, the determination, mitigation, negotiation and settlement of all amounts, costs, actions, penalties, damages and the like related thereto, access to the books and records of the Company, and, if necessary, providing the party controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim and its counsel with any powers of attorney or other documents required to permit the party controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim and its counsel to act on behalf of the other party. 

  

 (d) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may pay, settle or compromise a Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, so long as such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnified Party to any monetary liability that will not be promptly paid by the Indemnifying Party or any consent order, decree or injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not include a finding, statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act that would have an adverse effect on other claims made by or threatened against the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.05_, none of the provisions of this _Section 8.05_ shall be applicable to any Tax audit, assessment, contest or other claim that is subject to the provisions of _Section 9.01(c)_. 

  

 Section 8.06 _Limitations on Indemnification._  

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims is at least $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") (and Seller shall only be required to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party for claims in excess of the Deductible). The aggregate liability of Seller or Purchaser under this  _Article VIII_ for breaches of any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement is limited to an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Losses arising from or relating to any claim or liability to the extent (but solely to the extent) such claim or liability is taken into account in determining the Final Closing Net Working Capital or Final Closing Petty Cash pursuant to _Article II_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) In valuing any Loss, no adjustment shall be made as a result of any multiple, increase factor, or any other premium over fair market value, book or historical value which may have been paid by Purchaser whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used by Purchaser at the time of, or in connection with, calculating or preparing its bid, its proposed purchase price or its final purchase price. 

  

 (d) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ shall be calculated net of (i) any net insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss, (ii) any other payment received with respect to a Loss and (iii) any Tax benefit recognized by the Indemnified Party arising from such Loss, but only to the extent that such Tax benefit is recognized in the taxable year in which such Indemnified Party receives the indemnity payment with respect to such Loss or in a prior taxable year. The Indemnified Party shall (x) seek full recovery from any third parties and under all insurance policies covering any Loss and (y) use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any actual or potential Loss, in each case to be the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which it has been indemnified under this _Article VIII_, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery or benefit shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party that provided such indemnification to the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.05_, none of the provisions of this _Section 8.05_ shall be applicable to any Tax audit, assessment, contest or other claim that is subject to the provisions of _Section 9.01(c)_. 

  

 Section 8.07 _Exclusivity of Indemnification_. Except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation or to enforce a Partys right to specific performance under this Agreement, after the Closing Date, indemnification under this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole remedy of the parties for any breach of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , that Purchaser may assert its rights to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (subject to the applicable limitations, notice and other procedural provisions of this Article VIII) pursuant to the Cerberus Guaranty. 

   

 Section 8.08 _No Contribution or Subrogation_. In connection with the matters covered by this _Article VIII_, no Person shall have (a) any right to indemnity or contribution from the Company, or (b) any right of subrogation against the Company with respect to any Losses or indemnification of an Indemnified Party by reason of any breach of a covenant, representation or warranty of Seller hereunder, it being agreed and acknowledged that the representations, warranties and covenants of Seller are solely for the benefit of Purchaser. 

   

 Section 8.09 _Adjustment to Final Purchase Price_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, and no party shall take any position inconsistent with such characterization. 

   

 Section 8.10 _Environmental Remedies_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.07_ , Purchaser understands and agrees that its right to indemnification under _Article_  

    ##### 

  

 

 _VIII_ for breach of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall constitute its sole and exclusive remedy against Seller and
its Affiliates with respect to any environmental, health, or safety matters
relating to the past, current, or future facilities, properties, or
operations associated with the Company, including without limitation any such
matter arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, any other Environmental Laws or the common law
(collectively " _Environmental, Health and Safety Matters_ "). Subject to
_Section 8.07_, aside from such right to indemnification, Purchaser hereby
waives any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek contribution,
cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy from Seller or any of
its Affiliates, and hereby releases Seller any each of its Affiliates from
any claim, demand, or liability, with respect to any Environmental, Health,
or Safety Matters.

 (c) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Purchaser or the Company of written notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Company with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If Seller so requests within 30 days after receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall take all reasonable actions requested by Seller to permit Seller to defend such audit or relevant portion of such audit in the case of a 

   ##### 

  

 

Straddle Period for the purpose of contesting any claim arising as a result
of any such audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall have agreed
to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
with contesting such claim, (ii) if any contest of any such claim shall
require the payment of the disputed Tax that is subject to indemnification by
Seller, Seller shall advance the amount of such Tax on an interest-free basis

discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any permissible forum.

 Section 9.03 _Changes to Tax Elections, Annual Tax Accounting Periods, etc_. Without the prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall not, to the extent it may affect or relate to the Company, make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment.

ARTICLE X 

   

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS  

  

 Section 10.01 _Communications_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Purchaser shall not distribute any communications to any employees of the Company, whether relating to employee benefits or post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller shall inform Purchaser of the contents of any written communications that Seller intends to give to any employees of the Company regarding or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall incorporate Purchasers reasonable comments in such communications. 

   

 Section 10.02 _Benefit Plans_. 

  

Purchaser shall give employees of the Company (" _Employees_ ") full credit
for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such

    ##### 

  

 

the Seller or its benefit plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Purchaser for the benefit
of Employees on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) cause there
to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under comparable plans of
Seller and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-
of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such Employees with respect to
comparable plans maintained by Seller. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as granting the right to enforce any provision hereof to any
Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require Purchaser
to employ the Employees for any definite period of time or prohibit Purchaser
from changing the terms and conditions of employment. 

   

 Section 10.03 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification._  

   

 (a) If the Closing occurs, Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any officer, director or manager of the Company, in each case that is an individual (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Company after the Closing in accordance with their terms. The obligations of the Company under this _Section 10.03(a)_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this _Section 10.03(a)_ applies without the consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section 10.03(a)_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.03(a)_). If the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay all expenses to any Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this _Section 10.03(a)_. 

  

 (b) For six years after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount not materially less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such insurance policy may be a "tail" policy covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. In the event that any Company Indemnitee is entitled to coverage under an officers and directors liability insurance policy pursuant to this _Section 10.03(b)_ and such policy has lapsed, terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result of the Companys failure to maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to such policy as provided in this _Section 10.03(b)_, then the Company shall pay to the Company Indemnitee such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as the Company Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such policy. 

  

 (c) In the event Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper 

   ##### 

  

 

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or
the Company, as the case may be (or their respective successors and assigns),
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 10.03_. 

   

 Section 10.04 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to provide to Seller and its representatives and agents with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal business hours, to the books and records, information and employees (without substantial disruption of employment) of the Company with respect to periods or occurrences on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with any Tax matters related to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter requiring such books and records, information or employees for any reasonable business purposes. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Seller, neither Purchaser nor the Company shall, for a period of seven years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company for the period prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to Seller a copy of such books and records or any portion thereof which Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. 

   

 Section 10.05 _Compliance with 2006 Multimax Agreement_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to comply with its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated May 10, 2006, among the Company, the equityholders named therein, the representative named therein and Seller, which obligations were assigned by Seller to the Company pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2006, by and between Seller and the Company. 

   

 Section 10.06 _Releases of Seller Guarantees._ Following the Closing, Purchaser will (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure the release by the applicable counterparty of any continuing obligation of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any Seller Guarantee  _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall not be required to incur out-of-pocket costs or other expenses or obligations unless _de minimis_ in nature, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Liability directly resulting from any continuing obligation of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any Seller Guarantee. 

   

 Section 10.07 _Confidentiality._ Seller shall keep confidential, and cause its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep confidential, all information relating to the Company, except as required by Law and except for information that is available to the public on the Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 10.07_. The covenant set forth in this _Section 10.07_ shall terminate three years after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 10.07_, the term "confidential information" should not include any information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public or (b) was or becomes available to Seller, its Affiliates (other than the Company), or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and advisors on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company.

Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. 

  

 (b) This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder (including any employee of the Company), except that each Company Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the obligations of Purchaser and the Company solely with respect to _Section 10.03_ hereof.

therein, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings or intents
between or among any of the parties hereto with respect to such subject
matter. 

    

 (b) No amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding or effective for any purpose unless it is made in a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment, modification or waiver is sought. No course of dealing between the parties to this Agreement shall be deemed to modify, amend or discharge any provision or term of this Agreement. No delay by any party to this Agreement in the exercise of any of its rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof. A waiver of any right or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right or remedy on any other occasion. 

  

 Section 11.07 _Interpretation_. Article, titles and headings to Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. The references herein to Sections, Exhibits and Schedules, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Sections of and Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement.

 Section 11.08 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable, so that the outcome of any such modifications is an amended provision that comes closest under applicable Law to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision as of the date hereof, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. 

   

 Section 11.09 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of the other parties hereto. Such counterparts may be delivered by mail and facsimile transmissions or other means of non-alterable electronic transmission.

 Section 11.11 _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. There may have been included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not "material," and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement by Seller that such items are "material" or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Disclosures included in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be considered to be made for purposes of all other Sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any other Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure. The inclusion of any items or information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is material or otherwise required to be scheduled as an exception from any representation, warranty or covenant. Matters reflected in the Seller Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 Section 11.12 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law if any party fails to perform in any material respect any of its obligations hereunder and accordingly agree that each party, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at Law, in equity or, after the Closing, as provided in  _Article VIII_, shall be entitled to seek to compel specific performance of the obligations of any other party under this Agreement, without the posting of any bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law. No remedy shall be exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies shall be cumulative.

Other than pursuant to the Cerberus Guaranty, no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, limited partner or equityholder of Seller or Purchaser shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of Seller or Purchaser under this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, except in the case of fraud or willful breach. 

   

 Section 11.14 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR RISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH AGREEMENTS.
