<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.08 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration,
or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable, so that the
outcome of any such modifications is an amended provision that comes closest under applicable Law
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision as of the date
hereof, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time
within which the judgment may be appealed.

Disclosures included in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be considered to be
