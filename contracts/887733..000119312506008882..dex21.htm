which agreement is as follows:



ARTICLE I



PURCHASE OF SHARES



1.1 _Purchase of Shares_. At the Closing described in Section 2.1, the Buyer
will purchase a total of 1,923,077 shares of Class A Stock and 8,076,923
shares of Class B Stock (together the " _Shares_ ") from the Sellers, and the
Sellers will sell the Shares (which in total will be all the Shares) to the
Buyer, as follows:



1.1.1 The Buyer will purchase from the Duff Trust, and the Duff Trust will
sell to the Buyer, 1,442,308 shares of Class A Stock and 3,830,128 shares of
Class B Stock (together, the " _Duff Shares_ ").



1.1.2 The Buyer will purchase from the Bassham Trust, and the Bassham Trust
will sell to the Buyer, 480,769 shares of Class A Stock and 4,246,795 shares
of Class B Stock (together, the " _Bassham Shares_ ").



1.2 _Purchase Price_.



1.2.1 The purchase price to be paid by the Buyer for all the Shares (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") will be (a) the sum equal to (i) $287,000,000 (the "
_Agreed Price_ "), plus (ii) the amount of the Companys deposit with the
Internal Revenue Service to ensure payment of taxes after the Company ceases
to be an S Corporation, minus (iii) the amount of any indebtedness of the
Company or its subsidiary at the Closing Date for borrowed money (together,
the " _Closing Sum_ "), plus or minus (b) the adjustment described in Section
1.3.



1.2.2 Of the Purchase Price, 52.7244% (the " _Duff Percentage_ ") will be
paid to the Duff Trust for the Duff Shares and 47.2756% (the " _Bassham
Percentage_ ") will be paid to the Bassham Trust for the Bassham Shares. 1.3 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.



1.3.1 The Purchase Price will be the Closing Sum, increased or decreased by
the amount by which the Closing Date Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth is
greater or less than the November 30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth, each
calculated as provided below.



1.3.2 In order to permit calculation of the November 30 Adjusted Consolidated
Net Worth and the Closing Date Adjusted Net Worth, the Buyer and the Sellers
will do the following:



a. The Buyer and the Sellers will cooperate to cause the Company to deliver to
the Buyer and the Sellers on the Closing Date or as soon after that as they
are available, (a) the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its subsidiary at November 30, 2005 (the " _November 30 Balance Sheet_ "),
certified by Eide Bailly and Co. to have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (" _GAAP_ ")
and fairly to present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and
its subsidiary at that date and (b) a consolidated statement of net assets of
the Company and its subsidiary at November 30, 2005 (the " _November 30 Net
Asset Statement_ ) consisting of the November 30 Balance Sheet, adjusted to
eliminate (i) all cash, and all securities held by the Company as investments
and not related to the operation of the business of the Company or its
subsidiary (" _Investment Assets_ "), reflected on the November 30 Balance
Sheet, other than the cash and Investment Assets totaling $443,761.82 held in
Account No. 3BA-352932 with MandI Brokerage Services, Inc. (the " _Deer Payment
Account_ "), (ii) any indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiary for
borrowed money reflected on the November 30 Balance Sheet and (iii) the book
value reflected on the November 30 Balance Sheet of any assets that are
required by Section 5.4 to be sold prior to the Closing Date. An example of
the November 30 Net Asset Statement, based upon an assumed November 30 Balance
Sheet, and the adjustments made to create that November 30 Net Asset
Statement, is attached as Schedule 1.3.2-A.



b. Not later than 60 days after the Closing Date (or after such later date as
is 30 days after the November 30 Balance Sheet is delivered to the Buyer), the
Buyer will deliver to the Sellers a consolidated statement of net assets of
the Company and its subsidiary at the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Net
Asset Statement_ "), consisting of the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its subsidiary at the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance
Sheet_ ") prepared in accordance with GAAP applied in the same manner as it
was applied in preparing the November 30 Balance Sheet, adjusted to eliminate
any indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiary for borrowed money
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.



1.3.3 Unless within 30 days after the November 30 Net Asset Statement is
delivered to the Buyer and the Sellers, the Buyer gives a notice (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") to the Sellers, or at least one of the Sellers gives an
Objection Notice to the Buyer, in which it states that it believes that the
adjustments reflected on the November 30 Net Asset Statement are not correct
or are not complete, specifying in reasonable detail the respects in which
the adjustments reflected on the November 30 Net Asset Statement are not
correct or are not complete, the adjusted consolidated net worth shown on the
November 30 Net Asset Statement will be conclusively deemed to be the
adjusted consolidated net worth of the Company and its subsidiary at November
30, 2005 (the " _November 30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth_ ").



 

\- 2 - 1.3.4 Unless within 30 days after the Buyer delivers the Closing Date Net
Asset Statement to the Sellers, at least one of the Sellers gives an
Objection Notice to the Buyer in which it states that it believes either that
(i) the Closing Date Balance Sheet was not prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied in the same manner in which it was applied in preparing the November
30 Balance Sheet or (ii) the adjustments reflected on the Closing Date Net
Asset Statement are not correct or are not complete, specifying in reasonable
detail the respects in which the Closing Date Balance Sheet was not prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied in the same manner in which it was applied in
preparing the November 30 Balance Sheet or the adjustments reflected on the
Closing Date Net Asset Statement are not correct or are not complete, the
adjusted consolidated net worth shown on the Closing Date Net Asset Statement
will be conclusively deemed to be the adjusted consolidated net worth of the
Company and its subsidiary at the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth_ ").



1.3.5 If within the 30 day period described in Section 1.3.3, the Buyer or a
Seller delivers an Objection Notice with regard to the November 30 Net Asset
Statement, or within the 30 day period described in Section 1.3.4, a Seller
delivers an Objection Notice with regard to the Closing Date Net Asset
Statement, the Buyer and the Sellers will make a good faith effort to agree
upon the November 30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth or the Closing Date
Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth, as applicable, within 45 days after an
Objection Notice is delivered. If the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to
agree within the applicable 45 day period upon the November 30 Consolidated
Net Worth or the Closing Date Consolidated Net Worth, the Buyer and the
Sellers will refer all items specified in the applicable Objection Notice that
have not been resolved by agreement among them to KPMG or another firm of
independent public accountants agreed to by the Buyer and the Sellers (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") with a request that within 30 days the Accounting Firm
(a) determine (i) the proper resolution of each of the items specified in the
Objection Notice to which the Buyer and the Sellers have not agreed, and (ii)
the November 30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth or the Closing Date Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth, as applicable, after giving effect to all changes to
the applicable Net Asset Statement resulting from resolution of items
specified in the Objection Notice, whether by agreement among the Buyer and
the Sellers or due to determinations by the Accounting Firm, and (b) deliver
to the Buyer and the Sellers a statement showing the November 30 Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth or the Closing Date Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth, as
applicable, together with a description of how it was calculated. The November
30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth or the Closing Date Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth agreed to by the Buyer and the Sellers or determined
by the Accounting Firm will be conclusively deemed to be the November 30
Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth or the Closing Date Adjusted Consolidated Net
Worth.



1.3.6 On a day specified by the Buyer, which will be not fewer than three nor
more than ten days after the day on which both the November 30 Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth and the Closing Date Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth
have been conclusively determined as set forth in Section 1.3.3, 1.3.4 or
1.3.5, the Buyer will pay to the Sellers, or the Sellers will pay to the
Buyer, the sum by which the Closing Date Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth is
greater or less than the November 30 Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth. Of the
amount the Sellers are entitled to receive, or are required to pay, as
described in this Section 1.3.6, the Duff Percentage will be paid to or by the
Duff Trust and the Bassham Percentage will be paid to or by the Bassham Trust.

1990, among Charles B. Duff and Dorie Duff, as grantors, and Charles B. Duff

authority that is necessary to enable them to enter into this Agreement in
their capacity as trustees of the Seller and to cause the Seller to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly

and binding agreement of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller
in accordance with its terms.



3.1.3 _No Conflict or Default_.



a. If the consents described on _Schedule 3.1.3_ are obtained, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or of any document required to be
delivered in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document required to be

of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default) under (i) the trust agreement creating
the Seller, (ii) any agreement or instrument to which the Seller is a party or
by which it is bound or (iii) any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any
court or governmental agency or other regulatory body having jurisdiction
over the Seller.



b. No court approvals or authorizations, governmental filings, authorizations,
approvals or consents, or other governmental action, other than the
termination or expiration of waiting periods under the HSR Act, are required
to permit the Seller to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement.



3.1.4 _Ownership of Shares_. The Seller owns all the Shares it is selling free
and clear of any liens or encumbrances. Except as shown on _Schedule 3.1.4_ ,
the Seller has not granted any option or right, and is not a party to any

received notice, whether written or oral, that any such customer or supplier
will, or intends to, alter the terms of its business relationship with the
Company (including price and volume) from the terms existing, or contemplated
by the agreements existing, as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 3.2.19_ , insofar as any trustee of a Seller or officer of
the Company is aware (i) there exists no actual or threatened termination,
cancellation or limitation of, or any modification or change in, the business

modification or change in, the business relationship of the Company with any
supplier or group of suppliers listed in _Schedule 3.2.19_ , or whose sales
individually or in the aggregate are material to the Company or the operation
of its business and (iii) there exists no present or future condition or state
of facts or circumstances involving  



 

\- 14 -  customers, suppliers or sales representatives which any trustee of a Seller
or officer of the Company can now reasonably foresee would materially

those liabilities or obligations reflected in the Most Recent Balance Sheet,
(ii) liabilities or obligations not required by GAAP to have been reflected in
the Most Recent Balance Sheet which are not material to the Company and its
subsidiary taken as a whole (even if they would have been required by GAAP to

notes to the Most Recent Balance Sheet) and (iii) liabilities and obligations
of a similar nature arising in the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practice, since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet. For

and (iii) in the case of finished goods, are of a quality and quantity
saleable in the ordinary course of business and, in the case of all other

business. The inventory obsolescence policies of the Company are appropriate
for the nature of the products sold and the marketing methods used by the
Company, and the reserve for inventory obsolescence reflected in the Most
Recent Balance Sheet fairly reflects the amount of obsolete inventory as of
its date in accordance with GAAP.



3.2.23 _Accounting Practices_. The Company makes and keeps accurate books and
records reflecting its assets and maintains internal accounting controls that
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed
with managements authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary

accountability for the assets of the Company, (iii) access to the assets of
the Company is permitted only in accordance with managements authorization
and (iv) the reported accountability of the assets of the Company is compared
with existing assets at reasonable intervals. The Sellers do not, however,

execution and delivery of this Agreement or of any document required to be
delivered in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document required to
be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will violate, result in a
breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) under (i) the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or its subsidiary, (ii) any agreement
or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiary is a party or by which it
is bound or (iii) any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or other regulatory body having jurisdiction over the
Company or its subsidiary.

approvals or consents, or other governmental action, other than the
termination or expiration of waiting periods under the HSR Act, are required
to permit the Company to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement.

Agreement, and no statement contained in a certificate, schedule, list or
other instrument or document specified in or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, whether heretofore furnished to Buyer or hereafter required to be
furnished to Buyer (all such documents being taken as a whole), contains or
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or
therein not misleading.

against all income Taxes payable by the Buyer, the Company or its subsidiary
with regard to any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that may
result from such Tax Returns or audits and, in the case of amendments of Tax
Returns, the amendments to the Tax Returns will not result in any increased
Taxes to the Company or its subsidiary, except to the extent of amendments
resulting from determinations by applicable taxing authorities. The Buyer
shall control all Tax Return filings and audits of the Company and its
subsidiary except as specified in the preceding sentence. The Buyer will
cause the Company and its subsidiary to cooperate with the Sellers and their

Indemnified Party harmless from, any item of loss, liability or expense, the
