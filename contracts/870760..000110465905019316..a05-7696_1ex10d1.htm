# **ARTICLE III**

  

# ** **

  

# **EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK**

  

Section 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Acquisition Sub:

  

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock._ Each share of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " **Shares**
") (other than (i) Shares held in the CompanyÂ’s treasury, (ii) Shares held
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent and (iii)
Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted into and shall
become the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, then the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated by
the Merger shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of Shares. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate
in accordance with this _Article III_ , without interest.

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share
of Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

(c) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Acquisition Sub shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 3.2. _Stock Options_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (the "
**Company Options** "), whether granted under the Company Option Plans
or otherwise, whether vested or unvested in accordance with its terms
(including by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder of a Company
Option, and each holder of a Company Option shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the positive
difference, if any, between the Per Share Merger Consideration and the
exercise price of such Company Option _multiplied by_  (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option. As soon as
reasonable practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent (as
defined below) shall mail to each holder of a Company Option entitled to
consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ a check in the amount of
such consideration.

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may be required in order that (i) each outstanding Company Option shall
automatically accelerate so that each such Company Option shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, become fully exercisable for all of the shares
of Common Stock at the time subject to such Company Option and may be
exercised by the holder thereof for any or all of such shares as fully-vested
shares of Common Stock and (ii) upon the Effective Time, all outstanding
Company Options, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time,
shall be automatically cancelled without any action on the part of any holder
of Company Options in exchange for the consideration, if any, set forth in
_Section 3.2(a)_.  For avoidance of doubt, prior to the Closing, the Company
shall take all actions as may be required in order that each Company Option
with an exercise price equaling or exceeding the Per Share Merger
Consideration to automatically and duly terminate as of the Effective Time,
and no Per Share Merger Consideration, other cash amount or other property or
obligation shall be owed, due or payable by the Company, the Parent or
Acquisition Sub in respect of such Company Option.

  

Section 3.3. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under Section 262 of the
DGCL in respect of the Merger, then Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders
who have demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such Shares in
the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the
Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to
such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " **Dissenting** **Shares** "),
shall not be converted as described in

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

 _Section 3.1_ hereof, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,_
that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, such holderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted,
at the Effective Time, as described in _Section 3.1_ , into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
without any action on the part of the holder.  The Company shall give Parent
(a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholdersÂ’
rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL.  The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demand for payment with respect to
any Dissenting Shares or settle (or offer to settle) any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

Section 3.4. _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent._  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as an
agent (the " **Exchange Agent** "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares
and Company Options, in connection with the Merger. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit into a fund (the " **Exchange Fund** ")
with the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to each Share and (ii) the consideration
set forth in _Section 3.2_ with respect to each Company Option (collectively,
the " **Merger Consideration** "). Parent shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Exchange Agent
on a prompt and timely basis, as and when needed after the Effective Time,
any additional cash necessary to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1_.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates** ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in such form as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the number of Shares evidenced by such certificate and (B)
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.4_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or
accrue

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.  Company Options will
be treated in the manner provided in _Section 3.2_.

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock._ The Per Share
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ upon conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, _subject_ , _however_ ,
to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares or Company Options for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holder of Shares or Company Options who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration.

  

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger by each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and compliance by each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub with any of the provisions hereof will not (i) violate or
conflict with any provision of the charter document or Bylaws of each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub, (ii) violate, conflict with, or result in or
constitute a default under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
contract to which Parent or Acquisition is party or bound or (iii) subject to
the filings and other matters referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_ , violate,
conflict with, contravene or give any person the right to exercise any remedy
or obtain any relief under, any Judgment or Law applicable to Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their respective properties or assets, except in the case
of each of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such violations, defaults,
terminations or accelerations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

  

Section 5.4. _No Prior Activities_. Except for obligations incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Acquisition Sub has neither incurred any obligation or liability nor engaged
in any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into

Section 5.5. _Financing Ability_.

  

(a) Parent has provided to the Company accurate and complete copies of
executed commitment letters from National Australia Bank Limited, AMP Capital
Investors Limited and UBS AG, Australia Branch (the " **Lenders** "), dated
April 18, 2005 and April 28, 2005, providing for the debt financing, which
together with the funds to be provided pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letters (as defined below), is necessary for the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration and for Parent and Acquisition Sub to perform their
respective obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " **Transaction Financing** ") and describing
the terms and conditions upon which such Lenders will arrange and provide
such financing (the " **Commitment Letters** "). The Commitment Letters are
in full force and effect on the date hereof and have not been amended or
modified in any respect.  There are no facts and circumstances known to
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates that could
reasonably be expected to (a) prevent the conditions described in the
Commitment Letters from being satisfied, (b) prevent Parent from receiving
financing pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters or (c) make any of
the assumptions set forth in the Commitment Letters unreasonable.
The Lenders have not advised Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates of any facts which cause them to believe the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be consummated substantially
in accordance with the terms thereof. All commitment fees and other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the Commitment Letters on or prior to the
date hereof have been paid.  The aggregate proceeds of the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, when taken together with the funds
provided by the Equity Commitment Letters, are sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, to pay the

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

cash amounts payable to the Company optionholders in connection with the
Merger, to effect any refinancings of existing indebtedness of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries required as a result of the Merger and to pay
the anticipated fees and expenses related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " **Required Cash Amount**
").

  

(b) Parent has provided to the Company accurate and complete copies of
executed commitment letters from Pacific Equity Partners Fund II L.P., Pacific
Equity Partners Supplementary Fund II L.P., Pacific Equity Partners Fund II
(NQP) L.P., Pacific Equity Partners Fund II (Australasia) Pty Limited as
trustee for the Pacific Equity Partners Fund II (Australasia) Unit Trust,
Pacific Equity Partners Fund II (Australasia) Pty Limited as trustee for the
Pacific Equity Partners Supplementary Fund II (Australasia) Unit Trust, PEP
Investment Pty Limited and PEP Co-Investment Pty Limited dated on or about
April 18, 2005 providing for equity financing and describing the terms and
conditions upon which financing will be provided (the " **Equity Commitment
Letters** "). The Equity Commitment Letters are in full force and effect on
the date hereof and have not been amended or modified in any respect. There
are no facts and circumstances known to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to (a) prevent
the conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letters from being
satisfied, (b) prevent Parent and Acquisition Sub from receiving financing
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters or (c) make any of the
assumptions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters unreasonable.  None
of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates have been
advised of any facts which cause them to believe the financings contemplated
by the Equity Commitment Letters will not be consummated substantially in
accordance with the terms thereof. All commitment fees and other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters on or prior to
the date hereof have been paid.

  

Section 5.6. _Compliance with Law; Litigation_.  Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is in material compliance with all Laws which would affect
its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. There is no action pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent and Acquisition Sub, threatened against Parent
or Acquisition Sub that would affect their respective abilities to perform
their respective obligations hereunder.

  

Section 5.7. _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person, other than UBS AG and PEP Advisory Pty Limited, the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by Parent, is entitled to any
brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s, financial advisorÂ’s or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Acquisition Sub.

  

Section 5.8. _Information Supplied_. None of the information relating to
Parent or Acquisition Sub supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Acquisition
Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders
or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No
representation, warranty or covenant is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

information supplied by the Company in writing for inclusion or incorporation

Section 6.2. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approval._

shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (the "Proxy
Statement") in preliminary form. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy
Statement complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and Exchange Act. The Company shall provide Parent with

comments, and advise Parent of any oral comments or communications regarding
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC.

  

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any event occurs with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company

amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or

38   

     
   

  



  

necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the

Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum

and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, provide Parent and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access during normal business
hours to the facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their

that Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that such access will give due regard
to minimizing interference with the operations, activities and employees of

information it receives pursuant to this _Section 6.3(a)_ to its advisors,
its financiers and any advisors of its financiers, subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this _Section 6.3_ shall require the Company or its Affiliates to disclose
any information to Parent if such disclosure (i) would cause significant
competitive harm to such disclosing party or its Affiliates if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated or (ii)
would be in violation of applicable Laws or agreements.

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall hold and shall cause its representatives
and Affiliates to hold in confidence all documents and information furnished
to it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.4. _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof through the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or
(ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not knowingly
authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective officers, directors,
representatives and agents (including any financial advisors) (such persons
collectively shall be referred to as the " **Company Group** ") to, directly
or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to
cooperate in any with respect to, or assist in or facilitate (including by
way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal, or (B) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person or group of
persons (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates) concerning any Company Takeover Proposal, or (C) enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any letter of intent or
similar document) involving a Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Company receives an unsolicited written proposal for
a Company Takeover Proposal from another person, without any member of the
Company Group acting or omitting to act in a manner that is inconsistent with
this _Section 6.4(a)_ , that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Takeover Proposal, the
Company and its representatives may conduct such discussions or provide such
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as the
Company shall determine, but only if, prior to such provision of information
or discussion (A) the person making the proposal shall have entered into a
non-disclosure agreement substantially in the form of the Confidentiality
Agreement (and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this _Section 6.4_ ) and (B) the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
legal counsel, that it is required to do so for the purpose of exercising its
fiduciary duties. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one
day) notify Parent in writing if any member of the Company Group receives a
Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal, including any material terms of any such inquiry or Company
Takeover Proposal, and shall keep Parent informed of the status of any such
inquiry or Company Takeover Proposal. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.4_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent
with the exercise of its fiduciary duties or any other obligations under
applicable Law.

  

(b) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_ by any
member of the Company Group, whether or not acting on behalf of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of _Section 6.4(a)_
by the Company.

  

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or propose to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the

Merger, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any Company Takeover
Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but
provided always that the provisions of

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

 _Section 6.4(a)_ are complied with in full by the Company Group, if, prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board receives a
Superior Takeover Proposal and as a result thereof the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that it is
required for the purpose of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Company
Board may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger and
this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company complies with _Section 6.4(d)_
below.

  

(d) The Company shall give Parent forty-eight (48) hours notice that the
Company Board is considering, or is prepared to (i) withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement or (ii) accept a
Superior Takeover Proposal in order to allow Parent the opportunity to make
an offer to the Company; _provided_ that the Company may not definitively
accept a Superior Takeover Proposal unless the Company concurrently therewith
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_  and makes any payment
required by _Section 8.2(b)_.

  

(e) The Company and the Board shall not terminate, redeem any rights under,
or waive or amend any provision of the Shareholder Rights Plan to permit or
facilitate the consummation of any Company Takeover Proposal unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

  

Section 6.5. _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be

cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary

or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Acquisition
Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iii) any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it; _provided_ , _however_ , 

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement.

  

Section 6.6. _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the Affected
Employees, for a period ending on the first **** anniversary of the Effective
Time, with compensation and employee benefits of the type described in
_Section 4.16_  of this Agreement (other than any equity-based compensation
or benefit plans) which in the aggregate are at least as favorable to those
currently provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to their
employees, unless, with respect to any individual Affected Employee, such
Affected Employee agrees otherwise. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume all employment-related obligations and agreements with
respect to any Affected Employees (including, without limitation, all
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any "change of
control" or similar provisions relating to employees contained in any
existing contract and all termination or severance agreements with executive
officers identified on _Schedule 4.16_ ), which obligations and agreements
shall be performed in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing contained herein shall
be construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
specific Employee Plan or to continue the employment of any specific person.

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor long service leave
entitlements, as well as all unused vacation, holiday, sickness and personal
days accrued by the employees of Company and the Company Subsidiaries under

reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations
as to preexisting and at-work conditions, exclusions and waiting periods, if
any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Affected Employee under any benefit plan in which Affected Employees
participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
CompanyÂ’s or a Company SubsidiaryÂ’s then existing plans absent any change in
such welfare plan coverage and (ii) provide credit to each Affected Employee
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any change in coverage in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
new or changed plan. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
Affected Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries under which each Affected Employee may be eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Employee
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit with respect
to the same period of service. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue the employment
of any specific person.

  

Section 6.7. _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Effective Time, the Company, Acquisition Sub and Parent shall consult
with each other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties
shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining
the other partiesÂ’ written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by applicable Law, court process or pursuant to
any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case, to
the extent reasonably feasible, the relevant parties will be given a
reasonable opportunity to contest or comment on the proposed disclosure.

  

Section 6.8. _Indemnification; Insurance_.

  

(a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all obligations of the Company
in existence or in effect as of the date hereof, under applicable Laws, the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or by contract, to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws to,
each person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " **Indemnified Officers** ") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
counsel fees and expenses), settlement payments or liabilities arising out of
or in connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether or not arising prior to the Effective Time) based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of acts or omissions
of any Indemnified Officer occurring prior to the Effective Time or the fact
that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary at or prior to the Effective Time. The parties hereto intend, to
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 6.8_ shall apply without limitation to acts or
omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, or alleged acts or
omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, by the Indemnified
Officers in their capacities as officers or directors, as the case may be,
occurring prior to the Effective Time.  In the event an Indemnified Officer
is entitled to indemnification under this _Section 6.8_ , such Indemnified
Officer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Surviving Corporation for
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Officer in
pursuing such indemnification, including payment of such fees and expenses by
the Surviving Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action
upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Officer to repay such
payment if it shall be adjudicated that such Indemnified Officer was not
entitled to such payment. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligations in this _Section 6.8_.
 Each Indemnified Officer, and his or her heirs and legal representatives,
is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.8_ and may
specifically enforce its terms.  This _Section 6.8_ shall not limit or
otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Officer may have under
any agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary or under the
CompanyÂ’s or any such Company SubsidiaryÂ’s organizational documents or under
applicable Law.

  

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering each Indemnified Officer with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the
Effective Time and providing at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms that are not less advantageous to the insured parties than
those contained in the policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance in effect as of the date hereof for

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

officers and directors of Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
amount, the " **Maximum Premium** "). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of
the Maximum Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
the most advantageous policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such person. Parent shall not
permit the Surviving Corporation to merge or consolidate with any other
person unless the Surviving Corporation ensures that the successor entity
assumes the obligations imposed by this _Section 6.8_ or agrees to provide
the same indemnification, protection and insurance to the directors and
officers referred to in this _Section 6.8_ as is provided by the
Surviving Corporation to any directors and officers appointed after the
Effective Time or any directors and officers of Acquisition Sub immediately
before the Effective Time.

  

Section 6.9. _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the Transactions shall be paid by either Acquisition Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Acquisition Sub
and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes.

  

Section 6.10 _Shareholder Rights Plan_. The Company Board shall take all
action reasonably necessary in order to render the Shareholder Rights Plan
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as approved in
writing by Parent, the Company Board shall not (i) amend the Shareholder
Rights Plan, (ii) redeem any rights under the Shareholder Rights Plan or
(iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the
Shareholder Rights Plan, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub.

  

Section 6.11. _Takeover Statutes_. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in _Section 6.4_ , in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Company Board under Section 203 of the DGCL be withdrawn,
revoked or modified by the Company Board. If Section 203 of the DGCL (or any
comparable Laws relating to takeovers) is or may become applicable to the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Board shall promptly grant such approvals and take such
lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Laws on such transactions.

  

Section 6.12. _Consents_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (a) the consents listed on _Schedule 7.3(c)_ , and (b) all
necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any agreement to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise
in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement required to prevent the occurrence of an event that has, or would
reasonably be 

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Parent and
Acquisition Sub will cooperate with the Company to obtain such consents.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use best efforts to obtain
all necessary consents or approvals with respect to the leases set forth on
_Schedule 4.12(b)(i)_.

  

Section 6.13. _Antitrust Authorities_. As soon as is reasonably practicable,
Parent and the Company shall file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice any Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification and control laws and
regulations of any other applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by
the parties. The Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply the other
with any information which may be reasonably required in order to make such
filings, except to the extent that such disclosure (i) would cause
significant competitive harm to such disclosing party or its Affiliates if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated or (ii)
would be in violation of applicable Laws or agreements, and (b) supply any
additional information which may be requested by the United States Federal
Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice or the competition or merger control authorities of any other
jurisdiction and which the parties reasonably deem appropriate.

  

Section 6.14. _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
(i) to complete the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letters and
(ii) to complete the transactions contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letters, so as to obtain financing in an amount sufficient to pay the
Required Cash Amount.

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that at
any time funds are not or have not been made available pursuant to the
Commitment Letters so as to enable Parent to proceed with the Closing in a
timely manner, Parent shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain alternative funding in an amount at least equal to the Required Cash
Amount on terms and conditions substantially comparable to those provided in
the Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letters, or otherwise on
terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and (ii) shall continue to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(c) Following the date hereof, Parent will promptly advise the Company of (i)
any amendment, modification, termination or cancellation of any of the
Commitment Letters or Equity Commitment Letters, and (ii) any change, effect,
event, situation or condition or any other information of which Parent is
aware as a result of which it could reasonably be expected that the
Transaction Financing will not be obtained on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letters or the Equity Commitment Letters. None of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates will (A) attempt,
directly or indirectly, to induce or encourage the Lenders or other entities
not to fund any of the financing provided for in the Commitment Letters or
Equity Commitment Letters or (B) amend, terminate or waive any provisions of
the Commitment

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

Letters or Equity Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of the
Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), in any manner
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect ParentÂ’s ability to
obtain the Transaction Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates and agents are permitted to
keep the Lenders and providers of equity financing apprised of all
developments related to the Company.

  

Section 6.15. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_.  No later than one business day
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to Parent a
copy of the opinion of HLHZ delivered to the Company Board to the effect that
as of such date, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Common Stock of the Company.

  

Section 6.16. _No Affiliate Agreements_. Unless Parent otherwise consents, the
Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any contracts or other agreements of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with any Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other
than with the Company itself or any of its Subsidiaries).

  

Section 6.17. _FFPE, LLC_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate any guaranties given by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (other than FFPE, LLC and its Subsidiaries in the event of
a sale of the membership interests of FFPE, LLC) in connection with the
business conducted by FFPE, LLC and its Subsidiaries and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to sell FFPE, LLC and its Subsidiaries or the
assets thereof prior to the Closing.

  

Section 6.18. _Company SEC Documents_. The Company shall, before the Closing
Date, file all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed by the Company with the SEC on or before the Closing
Date pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act or pursuant to
the Securities Act.

  

Section 6.19. _Good Standing_. The Company shall cause the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to be in good standing in its jurisdiction of
incorporation and, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary.

  

Section 6.20. _Employee Acknowledgements_. The Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, an acknowledgement, which
shall include a customary release, from each of the employees of the Company
party to a Special One Time Compensation Plan as set forth on
_Schedule 4.10(a)(iii)_ , that, upon the payment of the amount due to such
employee upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to his or her Special
One Time Compensation Plan, such employee shall not be entitled to any
severance payment in the event that such employee does not remain employed
with the Company following the Closing.

Affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders, other than any liability of
the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, for fraud
or willful or intentional breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement under this Agreement occurring prior to such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall be deemed to waive any rights
of specific performance of this Agreement available to any party.
The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ and _Sections 6.3(c)_ , _9.2_ , _9.6_
 and _9.10_ shall survive any such termination.

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ , _Section 8.1(e)_  or _Section 8.1(f)_ , Parent would suffer

Thousand Dollars ($8,420,000) as liquidated damages immediately (and in any
event within one business day) upon the occurrence of the termination of this

required to reimburse Parent for more than Five Million Six Hundred Ten
Thousand Dollars ($5,610,000).

  

Section 8.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by

This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of the parties hereto.

  

Section 8.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument, in
writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision
of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach.

Section 9.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

  

Section 9.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties.  Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

Section 9.5. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such determination that
any term or other

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

  

Section 9.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  

Section 9.7. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."  All references
to "dollars" or "$" are references to United States Dollars.

  

Section 9.8. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors
and permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Article III_ and _Section
6.8_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.9. _Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create or be
deemed to create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part
of any direct or indirect stockholder of the Company or Parent or any
officer, director, employee, agent, representative or investor of any party
hereto.

  

Section 9.10. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Sections
8.2(b)_ and _8.2(c)_ , each of the parties hereto shall bear all legal,
accounting, investment banking and other expenses incurred by it or on its
behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether or not such transactions are consummated, except that expenses
incurred in connection with (i) filing, printing and mailing the Proxy
Statement (including all applicable filing fees) and (ii) the filing of pre-
merger notification forms under the HSR Act or any similar foreign Laws shall
be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

  

Section 9.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Merger, shall cause irreparable injury to the other
parties, for which damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive
relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such
partyÂ’s obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of
specific performance of its obligations hereunder, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

Section 9.12. _Venue_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any
federal court located in the State of

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
Merger, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the Merger in any court other than any Delaware state court or
any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and (d) waives any right
to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger.

  

Section 9.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

Section 9.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 9.15. _Disclosure Generally_. If and to the extent any information
required to be furnished in any Schedule is contained in this Agreement or
disclosed on any Schedule attached hereto, such information shall be deemed
to be included in all Schedules in which the information is required to be
included to the extent such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.
The inclusion of any information in any Schedule attached hereto shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the Company, in and of itself,
that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed or is
material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the Company.

  



  

54   

     
   

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
