otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto
in _Annex A_ unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding Company Common Shares at a price
of $1.15 per Company Common Share, net to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Common Share that may
be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer
Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, following the acceptance for payment of Company
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ "), each Company Common Share (other than
Cancelled Company Common Shares and, if applicable, Dissenting Shares) that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will thereupon
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Offer Price, and the Company will continue as the Surviving
Corporation, in accordance with Nevada Law, with Parent owning all of the
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, all upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, PKN ORLEN SA, ParentÂ’s direct parent company, has resolved to make a
capital contribution to Parent in an amount sufficient to provide Parent the
financing necessary to satisfy its economic obligations under this Agreement,
pursuant to, in accordance with and at the times required by this Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has duly and unanimously (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Company
Common Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement
and that the transactions contemplated herein, including the Offer and the
Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Company
Common Stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend that the
Company Common Stockholders tender their shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer, and (iv) resolved to submit this Agreement to a vote of the Company
Common Stockholders if required by Nevada Law to consummate the Merger and, in
connection therewith, to recommend approval and adoption of

      
 

 



 

this Agreement by the Company Common Stockholders, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

withdraw or terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without

or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct or supplement any

required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so corrected,

(b) _Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(i) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms of
this _Section 1.2(b)_, the Company Board shall (A) recommend that the Company
Common Stockholders (I) accept the Offer and tender their Company Common
Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and (II) if the Shareholder
Approval is required by Nevada Law to consummate the Merger, grant the
Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (B) include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement and
(C) permit Parent and Merger Sub to include a description of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents, in each case if and to the extent that
a Company Board Recommendation Change has not been effected in accordance with
this _Section 1.2(b)_.

 



 

(ii) Subject to the terms of this _Section 1.2(b)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (A) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve, endorse or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after the CompanyÂ’s receipt
of a written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following the
date that any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) (I) shall have made an Acquisition Proposal (other than a tender offer or
exchange offer described in clause (D) below) and the existence of such
Acquisition Proposal becomes known in the public domain or (II) shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal or the existence of or information regarding an intention
to make an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become known in the
public domain, (D) fail to recommend that the Company Common Stockholders
reject, and not tender their Company Common Shares into, any tender offer or
exchange offer with respect to the outstanding Company Common Shares that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, or
(F) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions
(any action described in the preceding clauses (A)-(F) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (A) the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith is _bona
fide_ , and after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a
Superior Proposal and after consultation with its outside legal counsel
determines that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the Company
Common Stockholders under applicable Law, (B) such Acquisition Proposal did
not arise out of a breach of the provisions of this _Section 1.2(b)_ or
_Section 6.1_, (C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior written notice thereof (a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which
Determination Notice shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change), unless at the time, there is less than five (5) Business Days until
the Expiration Date, in which case the Company will provide as much notice as
possible, which Determination Notice shall set forth the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal in reasonable detail (including the
identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal), and, during such five
(5) Business Day period (or such shorter period until the Expiration Date),
the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel,
all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss
in good faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute, or to be reasonably
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be effected, and (D) Parent shall not have made, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of the Determination Notice (or such shorter
period until the Expiration Date), a counter-offer or proposal of a nature
such that the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) that
the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal. The provisions of this _Section 1.2(b)(iii)_
shall also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and
require a new Determination Notice and a new three (3) Business Day notice
period.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Closing in response to an Intervening Event if (A) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company Board is
reasonably required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in order
to comply with its fiduciary duties under Nevada Law, (B) the Company Board
shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least five (5) Business Days
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, which
Determination Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying
the Company BoardÂ’s determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and
the rationale and basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and,
during such five (5) Business Day period, the opportunity to meet with the
Company Board and its outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent
of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of
the terms and

 



   

     
 

 



 

conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected, and (C) following the
expiration of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) and
after giving good faith consideration to any offer or proposal from Parent,
that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company Board is reasonably
required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties under Nevada Law; _provided_ , that the Company
Board shall not be permitted to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
under this _Section 1.2(b)(iv)_ in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (which
shall be covered by and solely subject, in all respects, to _Section
1.2(b)(iii)_).

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
and the Company Board shall not be prohibited from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Company Common Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that any statement(s) made by the
Company or the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, other than a communication described in
clause (ii) of this sentence, shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless accompanied by a clear, unqualified and
unconditional reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, or (ii)
making a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to and in compliance
with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
Company Common Stockholders), and any such communication described in this
clause (ii) shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change
and shall not require compliance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 1.2(b)_. For avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change, and any Company Board Recommendation Change effected
simultaneously with such termination shall not require compliance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or
shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly (and in any event in sufficient
time to permit Merger Sub to commence the Offer in a timely manner) furnish
Parent with such information, including a list of the Company Common
Stockholders as of the most recent practicable date, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of all
record and non-objecting beneficial Company Common Stockholders as of the most
recent practicable date, and lists of security positions of Company Common
Shares held in stock depositories (including updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels, listings or files of securities positions as requested by
Parent from time to time), and such other information and with such assistance
as Parent, Merger Sub or their respective agents may reasonably request, in
order to mail, disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer to the record
and beneficial Company Common Stockholders. Subject to any and all applicable
Laws, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall (i) hold in confidence the
information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
listings or files of securities positions, (ii) use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) if Parent and Merger Sub
shall withdraw the Offer or the Offer shall otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

expire or terminate in accordance with the terms hereof without Merger Sub (or
Parent on Merger SubÂ’s behalf) having accepted for payment any Company Common
Shares pursuant to the Offer or this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
_Article VII_, Parent and Merger Sub shall either, in ParentÂ’s sole
discretion, (A) destroy any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from
such information then in their possession or control (and if requested by the
Company, certify in writing to such destruction) or (B) deliver (and shall
cause their agents to deliver) to the Company, any and all copies and any
extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or
control.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Directors_. If, following the Acceptance Time, the Top-Up Option
is not exercisable in accordance with Section 1.4, immediately following the
Acceptance Time, and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
elect or designate two individuals selected by Parent to serve as directors on
the Company Board, which individuals shall be "independent" under NASDAQ Rules
to the extent necessary to cause a majority of the Company Board to be
"independent" under NASDAQ Rules. If Parent is entitled to elect or designate
directors pursuant to this Section 1.3, after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon request by Parent, take all actions as are necessary, subject to
compliance with applicable Law, to enable ParentÂ’s designees to be so elected
or appointed to the Company Board, including by promptly filling vacancies or
newly created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size
of the Company Board (including by amending the Company bylaws if necessary to
increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as is necessary to
provide Parent with such level of representation, and shall cause ParentÂ’s
designees to be so elected or appointed at such time. After the Acceptance
Time, if the Top-Up Option is not exercisable in accordance with Section 1.4,
the Company shall also cause one individual selected by Parent to serve on (i)
each committee of the Company Board to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and NASDAQ Rules and (ii) the board of directors (or similar body) of FX
Energy Poland, Sp. z.o.o. (" _FX Poland_ "). No Person designated by Parent to
serve on the Company Board or any of its committees or the board of directors
(or similar body) of FX Poland pursuant to this Section 1.3 shall be entitled
to receive any compensation from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
such service. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall
not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective

Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise.

 



 

Section 1.4. _Top-Up Option._

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the Acceptance Time and only upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase at a price
per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of Company Common
Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Company
Common Shares that, when added to the number of Company Common Shares owned by
Parent or Merger Sub or any of ParentÂ’s wholly-owned Subsidiaries at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the
then outstanding Company Common Shares (on a fully diluted basis) (the "
_Short-Form Merger Threshold_") that would be outstanding immediately after
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Top-Up Option Shares shall not exceed the number of Company Common Shares then
authorized and unissued and not reserved for issuance

 



      
 

 



 

under the Company Employee Benefit Plans as of the date hereof (including as
authorized and unissued Company Common Shares, for purposes of this _Section
1.4_, any Company Common Shares held in the treasury of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Available Shares_ ") and shall not be
exercisable if immediately after exercise and issuance of all Available Shares
pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the Short-Form Merger Threshold would not be
reached; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option may not be
exercisable on more than one occasion. Upon ParentÂ’s request, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify
in writing to Parent the number of Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.
Merger Sub may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the
Top-Up Option Shares either entirely in cash or, at Merger SubÂ’s election, by
paying (x) in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) Parent and Merger Sub executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less
the amount paid in cash (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note shall
be unsecured, full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, non-negotiable and non-
transferable, shall bear simple interest at 1% per annum, shall provide that
principal and interest is due one year after the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, shall be prepayable in whole or in part without premium or penalty and
shall have no other material terms.

 



 

(b) Provided that no applicable Law (other than NASDAQ Rules, which shall not
apply for purposes of this _Section 1.4_) shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, Merger Sub may exercise the
Top-Up Option after the Top-Up Option has become exercisable and prior to the
Effective Time. The Top-Up Option shall expire upon the earlier to occur of
(i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send to the Company a
written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the number of
Top-Up Option Shares Merger Sub wishes to receive, (ii) whether the exercise
price will be paid in the form of cash or a combination of cash and a
Promissory Note, and (iii) the place, time and date for the closing of the
purchase and sale of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The
Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a
written notice to Merger Sub confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and
the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At
the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, including, at Merger SubÂ’s
option, by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount
equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall
cause to be issued and delivered to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at Merger SubÂ’s request or otherwise
if the Company does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number
of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company Common Shares which
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the

 



      
 

 



 

Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and shall be upon any purchase
of Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the
Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

the contrary, if following the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Merger Sub in
accordance with this Agreement and, if applicable, the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, Parent, Merger Sub and their controlled Affiliates shall own, in the
aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding Company Common Shares, the parties
hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Closing to

York office of

 



      
 

 



 

Greenberg Traurig, LLP, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time
and, if the Shareholder Approval is required under Nevada Law in order to

in any event no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the

but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder)
of such conditions), or at such other location, date and time as Parent and
the Company shall mutually agree in writing. The date upon which the Closing
shall actually occur pursuant hereto shall be referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

Nevada Law in order to consummate the Merger, the Shareholder Approval shall
have been obtained.

 



 

(iii) _No Governmental Restraints_. No Governmental Authority of competent

Law or Order that has the effect of making the consummation of the Merger
illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(iv) _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall have provided Parent with a
"FIRPTA Certificate", in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the effect
that the Company is not and has not been a "United States real property
holding corporation", as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, during the
period described in Section 897(c)(1) of the Code, and no interest in the
Company is a "United States real property interest" as defined in Section
897(c)(1) of the Code.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Payment of Merger Consideration._

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration, for payment to the Company Common Stockholders pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash amount being referred to herein as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Such funds shall be invested or otherwise held by
the Payment Agent in cash or cash equivalents as directed by Parent or Merger
Sub, in their sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Payment Agent to
the holders of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Shares. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the
" _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Common Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares (other than Cancelled
Company Common Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon (i) surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, or (ii) receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the
Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Payment
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares,
the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, and the Certificates
so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be
cancelled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or transfer of
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Until so surrendered or
transferred, outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of the Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer or
such Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and the Person requesting such
payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, or established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Payment Agent that
such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost,

 



      
 

 



 

stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this _Article II_; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Common Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any Company
Common Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
transferred their Book-Entry Shares evidencing such Company Common Shares for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Common Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to
Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares._

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each outstanding option to purchase Company
Common Shares under the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding and that has not vested
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall automatically vest and become
immediately exercisable at the Acceptance Time pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan. Each Company Stock Option that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding and that has not been exercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall not be assumed or substituted for by Parent and,
instead, shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such
Company Stock Option or any other Person, be cancelled without payment of
consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of any Company

 



   

     
 

 



 

Common Share subject to vesting, forfeiture or other restrictions pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") or any other
Person, each Company Restricted Share that (i) has become vested on or before
the Closing by its written terms as set forth in the applicable Company Stock
Plan or award agreement as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and
(ii) has not been settled as of the Closing Date shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the holder of any Company Restricted Share or any other Person, each Company
Restricted Share shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and any
award agreement evidencing the grant of any such Company Restricted Share
shall thereafter represent only the right, in accordance with and subject to
this _Section 2.8(b)_, to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
the Company Restricted Shares formerly represented thereby.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Dissenting Company Common Shares_. Pursuant to NRS 92A.390, no
Company Common Stockholder shall have any right under NRS 92A.300-92A.500 to
dissent from, or to obtain payment of the fair value of its Company Common
Shares in connection with, the consummation of the Merger unless, as of the
applicable date specified in subsection 2 of NRS 92A.390, the Company Common
Shares are not of a class or series specified in clause (a) or (b) of
subsection 1 of NRS 92A.390. In the event that, as of such date, the Company
Common Shares are not of such a class or series, then, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held or
beneficial owned by a Person who is entitled to assert and properly asserts
dissenterÂ’s rights with respect to such Company Common Shares (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, NRS 92A.300-92A.500
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i) and shall entitle such Person only to payment in
respect of such shares in accordance with and to the extent provided in NRS
92A.300-92A.500, unless such Person fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
loses its dissenterÂ’s rights under NRS 92A.300-92A.500. If, after the
Effective Time, any such Person fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
loses such dissenterÂ’s rights, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i). The Company,
prior to the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation, after the
Effective Time, shall comply with all applicable notice and other requirements
of NRS 92A.300-92A.500. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any assertion of dissenterÂ’s rights pursuant to NRS
92A.300-92A.500 received by the Company and any withdrawals thereof. Parent
shall have the right to participate in and, after the Acceptance Time, direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such assertion of
dissenterÂ’s rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld or delayed, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such assertion of dissenterÂ’s rights, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Necessary Further Action_. In the event that, at any time from
and after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and
necessary action on

 



      
 

 



 

behalf of the Company and Merger Sub to accomplish the foregoing. From and
after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or

_Article IV_ that specifically corresponds to the section of subsection of
the Parent Disclosure Letter in which any such disclosure is set forth, and
(ii) any other section or subsection of this _Article IV_ solely to the
extent that it is readily apparent from the text of such disclosure (without
reference to the underlying documents referenced therein and without assuming
any Knowledge of the matters disclosed) that such disclosure is applicable to
such other section or subsection of this _Article IV_ ( _provided_ that the
mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty is not deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect) Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Organization and Good Standing_. Parent is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Poland and has the
requisite entity power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Nevada and has the corporate power and
authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its properties and assets.

 



      
 

 



 

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.2. _Authorization and Enforceability_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has the corporate or other requisite entity power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this

Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the
Merger) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other entity
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate or other
entity proceeding on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to
authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (b) is
subject to rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies and general principles of equity.

 



 

Section 4.3. _Required Governmental Consents_. No Consent of any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their

as may be required by any federal or state securities Laws, including
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (c) such
filings and approvals as may be required to be made or obtained under
Antitrust Laws, and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.4. _Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the
compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of the provisions hereof do not
and will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the articles or
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable organizational
documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) violate, conflict with, or result in
the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under any Contract to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party, or by which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, (c) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.3, violate or conflict with any Law or Order

 



      
 

 



 

applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any of their properties or
assets are bound, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for such
violations, conflicts or defaults which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

employees in writing expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Offer Documents.

 



 

(b) None of the information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or their officers,
directors, Representatives, agents or employees in writing expressly for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement will, on the date the
Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, is first filed with the
SEC, first sent to the Company Common Stockholders or at the Acceptance Time,
in the case of the Schedule 14D-9, or the Effective Time, in the case of the
Proxy Statement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

or is reasonably likely to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal; and (B)
furnish to any Person that has made any such Acquisition Proposal any non-

assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing), all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this

Section 6.3. _Regulatory Approvals_. Without limiting the generality of
Section 6.2, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
fifteen (15) Business Days) following the date hereof, each of Parent and, if
applicable, the Company shall file pre-merger notification filings, forms and
submissions with any foreign Governmental Authority that may be required by
applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case as Parent reasonably deems necessary.
Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly, subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure to counsel and outside consultants retained by such counsel, and
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Law, (i)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii)
supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the competition or merger control
authorities of any jurisdiction and that Parent reasonably deems necessary.
Parent shall be solely responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with filings made in connection with this Section 6.3. Each party
hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case
may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
commit or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to

written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or

exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement from the anti-takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

afford Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company to enable Parent to
obtain all information concerning the assets and the businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however,_
that any such access shall be conducted at ParentÂ’s expense, at a reasonable
time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing
herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion
(i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene
any applicable legal requirement; _provided, however,_ that information shall
be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary
form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent (subject to
an appropriate confidentiality agreement with such counsel), to the extent
doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Antitrust Laws; and _provided, further,_ that the parties will
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to find a way to allow
diligence of such information in a manner that would not cause such results;
and _provided, further,_ that no

 



       
 

 



 

information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive (i)
any right or claim of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any representation
or warranty of the Company or a Subsidiary set forth herein, or (ii) any
condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the

of its Subsidiaries would be permitted or required to indemnify or exculpate a
Company Indemnified Person, whether pursuant to articles or certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents or any indemnification
agreement, Parent and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless against any cost or expenses (including
Indemnification Expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,

of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each Person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option,
substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and
amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such Persons than the DandO
Insurance, so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in
coverage; _provided, further_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this
_Section 6.10(c)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount

hundred percent (200%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in Section
6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter), _provided, further,_ that that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance, provided that the
cost of such Tail Policy does not exceed a net amount greater than two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the most recent annual premium. In the event that
Parent purchases such a Tail Policy prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_ for so long as such Tail Policy

shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the Merger and
shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Company Indemnified Person or other Person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Company
Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Company Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
_Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section
6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such Persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

Section 6.12. _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through its board of
directors, compensation committee or its "independent directors" to the extent
required) will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding that has been or will be entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which compensation, severance or other benefits is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule

deposit all funds necessary for such redemption in trust in accordance with
Section 5(f) of the Company Preferred Shares Designation. Thereafter, Parent
and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause such
Company Preferred Shares to be redeemed in accordance with the terms of such
notice of redemption and the Company Preferred Shares Designation.

 



 

Section 6.15. _Sale of Certain Businesses_. Notwithstanding the restrictions
set forth in Section 5.2, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate, prior to the Closing, the sale of the United States
businesses identified in Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter to one
or more Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company for an all-cash purchase
price and on arms-length terms reasonably acceptable to Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that a sale of the assets
identified in Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be
considered a condition precedent to the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger.

 



 

Section 6.16. _Post-Effective Amendments_. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent to timely provide all information and assistance that Parent reasonably
requests in order to prepare post-effective amendments to withdraw from

Section 8.12. _Remedies._

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and the

provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) any party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.12_, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



 

Section 8.13. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void

 



      
 

 



 

or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force
and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

Section 8.14. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of Law thereof _; provided, however,_ that the laws of the State
of Nevada shall govern to the extent that the provisions of the NRS are
specifically referenced herein or that it is mandatory that the NRS apply to
any of the provisions of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and to (i) the rights (including any applicable
dissentersÂ’ rights) of stockholders in connection with, the Offer and the
Merger and (ii) the duties and obligations of directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized
by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and covenants
not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction, venue and process. Each party hereto hereby agrees not to
commence any Legal Proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) in
any jurisdiction or courts other than as provided herein. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding between the parties
hereto with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named court for any reason other than
the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.15, (ii) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court
or from any legal process commenced in such court (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of
such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court.

 



 

Section 8.16. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER
SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.17. _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
Representative or Affiliate of any party hereto or of any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement)
shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations
or Liabilities of such party arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
Section 8.17 shall limit any liability of the parties to this Agreement for
breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.18. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all

transmission of signatures shall constitute original signatures for all
purposes of this Agreement and any enforcement hereof.
