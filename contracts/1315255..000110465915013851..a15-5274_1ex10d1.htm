 **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is entered into as
of February 19, 2015, by and among GTT Communications, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), Global Telecom and Technology Americas, Inc., a
Virginia corporation (" ** _Purchaser_** "), MegaPath Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Seller_** "), and MegaPath Corporation, a Virginia
corporation (the " ** _Company_** "). Purchaser, Seller and the Company are
sometimes referred to herein individually as a " ** _Party_** " and,
collectively, as the " ** _Parties_** ". Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Annex A_.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Seller owns beneficially and of record all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock and other equity interests in the Company
(collectively, the " ** _Shares_** ").

 



 

B. Parent owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser.

 



 

C. Prior to December 31, 2014, the Company conducted three lines of business,
which it referred to as (1) Network Services, (2) Cloud and Hosted Services and
(3) Managed Services.

 



 

D. The Managed Services business of the Company includes the provision of (1)
virtual private network (VPN) services, including MPLS VPN, IP Sec, Hybrid VPN
and Remote Access SSL VPN, (2) managed security services, including network-
and CPE-based unified management, firewall, intrusion detection and
prevention, managed logging, anti-virus, anti-spam and content filtering, and
(3) other managed services, consisting of compliancy solutions, proactive
network monitoring, customer portal, Cos/QoS and managed broadband (such
business, the " ** _Business_** " and as conducted by the Company, the " **
_Acquired Business_** ").

 



 

E. On December 31, 2014, the Company consummated the sale of its Network
Services business to Global Capacity, which was structured as a contribution
of the relevant assets and liabilities of the Network Services business to a
new entity and the sale of that entity to Global Capacity. Prior to the
Closing, the Company will transfer to an Affiliate of the Company (" **
_CloudCo_** ") all of the assets and liabilities of the Company that are not
directly related to the Acquired Business (such business, the " ** _Cloud and
Hosted Services Business_**") and such transfer, the " ** _Divestiture_** ").
Accordingly, immediately prior to the Closing, the business of the Company
will consist only of the Acquired Business and the employees, assets and
liabilities of the Company will consist only of employees, assets and
liabilities directly related to the Acquired Business.

 



 

F. Subject to consummation of the Divestiture, Purchaser desires to acquire
from Seller all of the Shares, and Seller desires to sell, assign, transfer
and convey to Purchaser all of the Shares, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

      
 

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the representations and
warranties and mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

 



 

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, at the Closing Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and acquire
from Seller, all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, in exchange for
the payment by Purchaser, in accordance with _Section 1.2_, of the Purchase
Price.

 



 

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall be:
(a) One Hundred Thirty- Four Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars
($134,800,000), (b) _plus_ Six Hundred Ten Thousand Eight Hundred Forty Three
(610,843) shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent
(such shares, the " ** _Parent Stock_** "), (c) _plus_ the amount of
Estimated Closing Cash, (d) _plus_ Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in cash
(the " ** _Deferred Cash Payment_** "), (e) _plus_ the amount, if any, by
which Estimated Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital, (f) _minus_
the amount, if any, by which Estimated Working Capital is less than Target
Working Capital and (g) _minus_ the aggregate amount described on _Schedule
1.2(g)_ with respect to Company Indebtedness identified on _Schedule 1.2(g)_
, determined in the manner contemplated by _Schedule 1.2(g)_ (the amount set
forth in the preceding _clause (a)_ , as adjusted pursuant to _clauses (c)_ ,
_(g)_ and _(e)_ or _(f)_ , as applicable, is the " ** _Closing Cash
Consideration_** "; and the result of the calculation set forth in the
preceding _clauses (a)_ through _(g)_ is the " ** _Closing Purchase Price_**
", and as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.5_, is the " ** _Purchase Price_**
").

 



 

1.3 _Payment of the Closing Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Payment of Closing Cash Consideration_. At the Closing, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall
pay, or cause to be paid, the Closing Cash Consideration by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as follows:

 



 

(i) to each holder of Company Indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing, other than any such Indebtedness identified on _Schedule 1.2(g)_
, the amount necessary to pay off the Company Indebtedness held by such
holder;

 



 

(ii) to each Person identified in the Closing Statement, any Company
Transaction Expenses remaining unpaid to such Person in accordance with the
Closing Statement; and

 



 

(iii) the balance to Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Payment of Parent Stock_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered to Seller, the Parent Stock by electronic deposit of such shares
in an account designated by Seller reasonably in advance of the Closing or, if
requested by Seller or if Seller fails to so identify such an account, by
delivery to Seller of a physical certificate for such shares. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, the provisions of _Section 1.2(b)_ or any other provision of
this Agreement, in the event that (i) the Parent Stock is not listed on the
New York Stock Exchange immediately prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the
representations and warranties of Parent set forth in Section 2(e) or Section
2(f) of the Subscription Agreement would be untrue when made if Parent
executes and delivers the Subscription Agreement at the Closing, then (A)
Parent will not deliver the Parent Stock at the Closing and instead the amount
referred to in _Section 1.2(a)_ shall be increased to One Hundred Forty
Million Dollars ($140,000,000) and (B) the Parties shall not, and shall not be
obligated to, execute and deliver the Subscription Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Deferred Cash Payment_. On the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including _Article VIII_), Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the Deferred Cash Payment (as reduced by any prior application of
_Section 8.8_ and any amounts subject to unresolved indemnification claims
pursuant to _Article VIII_ in favor of Purchaser) to Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

 



 

(d) _Closing Statement_. In order to facilitate the payments contemplated by
_Section 1.3(a)_, not less than three (3) Business Days nor more than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a statement (the " ** _Closing Statement_** ") setting forth: (i)
the Companys good faith estimate of (A) the aggregate amount of all Actual
Cash of the Company as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (the "
** _Estimated Closing Cash_** "), (B) the Working Capital as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date (the " ** _Estimated Working Capital_** "), (C)
the Company Indebtedness as of the opening of business on the Closing Date
(the " ** _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_** ") and (D) the aggregate amount
of any Company Transaction Expenses required to be paid pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)(ii)_ (the " ** _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_** "), in each
case under this _clause (i)_ together with supporting work papers, (ii) the
name of each Person to receive a payment at the Closing under _Section
1.3(a)_, (iii) the amount payable to each such Person and (iv) wire
instructions for each such Person. There shall be appended to the Closing
Statement (I) payoff letters for the Company Indebtedness referred to in
_Section 1.3(a)(i)_ and (II) invoices of the advisors, legal counsel,
accountants and other professionals for the fees and expenses to be paid at
the Closing pursuant to _Sections 1.3(a)(ii)_. Purchaser shall have the right
to review and comment on the Closing Statement, and Seller shall give
consideration in good faith to any such comments, but the failure or refusal
of Seller to accept any such comments shall not delay the Closing. The Closing
Statement shall be prepared (and the estimates, determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be made) in accordance with this
Agreement, including _Section 1.5(e)_.

 



 

1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the " **
_Closing_** ") shall take place: (a) at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP,
located at 901 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001, (b) at 10:00 a.m.
(New York time) on the later of (i) the fourth (4th)

 



      
 

 



 

Business Day after the date on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than conditions which, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the waiver or
satisfaction of those conditions) has been satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement or (ii) April 1, 2015; or (c) at such other place, time
and date as Purchaser and Seller shall mutually agree in writing. The " **
_Closing Date_** " shall be the date upon which the Closing occurs.

 



 

1.5 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As soon as practicable after the completion of the
audit of the Unaudited Financial Statements, but no earlier than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date or later than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a statement (the " **
_Final Closing Statement_** ") setting forth Purchasers good faith
determination of: (i) the aggregate amount of all Actual Cash (the " **
_Actual Cash_** "), (ii) the Working Capital as of the opening of business on
the Closing Date (the " ** _Actual Working Capital_** "), (iii) the aggregate
amount of all Company Indebtedness, as of immediately prior to the Closing ("
** _Actual Company Indebtedness_** "), (iv) the aggregate amount of all
Company Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " **
_Actual Company Transaction Expenses_** "), and (v) the amount by which the
sum (which may be a negative number) of the Actual Cash, plus Actual Working
Capital (which may be a negative number), minus Actual Company Transaction
Expenses and minus Actual Company Indebtedness exceeds or is less than the sum
(which may be a negative number) of the Estimated Closing Cash, plus the
Estimated Working Capital (which may be a negative number), minus the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness and minus the Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses (the amount of such excess (including any decrease in a negative sum)
being a " ** _Net Increase_** ", and the amount of such shortfall (including
any increase in a negative sum) being a " ** _Net Decrease_** "), which
statement shall also set forth in reasonable detail Purchasers calculation of
such amounts. The Final Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including _Section 1.5(e)_.

 



 

(b) _Seller Review_.

 



 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after receipt by Seller of the Final Closing
Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** ")
to Purchaser of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content
of the Final Closing Statement, which Dispute Notice shall include a written
description of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the
extent reasonably possible), all in reasonable detail. If during such sixty
(60)-day period Seller notifies Purchaser that it does not dispute the Final
Closing Statement, then the Actual Cash, Actual Working Capital, Actual
Company Indebtedness, Actual Company Transaction Expenses and Net Increase or
Net Decrease, as applicable, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement,
shall become final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller at the time
such notice is delivered. If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice within
such sixty (60)-day period, then Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have
waived any right to object to the Final Closing Statement delivered by
Purchaser and the Actual Cash, Actual Working Capital, Actual Company
Indebtedness, actual Company Transaction Expenses and Net Increase or Net
Decrease,

 



      
 

 



 

as applicable, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement shall become final,
conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller.

 



 

(ii) During the sixty (60)-day period referred to in _Section 1.5(b)(i)_ and
any subsequent time period in which the Final Closing Statement is being
disputed as provided in _Section 1.5(c)_, Purchaser shall cause the Company
to (A) provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice and during times mutually and reasonably agreeable to
Purchaser and Seller, to the books, records and working papers of the Company
that are directly related to the Final Closing Statement and necessary for
Seller to undertake is review of the Final Closing Statement and (B) undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its employees to confer with Seller
regarding the foregoing, in the case of each of the preceding _clauses (A)_
and _(B)_ for purposes of review by Seller and its representatives of the
Final Closing Statement and the calculations set forth thereon.

 



 

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered
within the sixty (60)-day period referred to in _Section 1.3(b)(i)_, (i) any
amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement and not disputed in such
Dispute Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller;
and (ii) Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith during the thirty
(30)-day period after delivery of such Dispute Notice to resolve each dispute
raised therein (each, an " ** _Objection_** "), and if any Objection is
resolved, the item so resolved shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding
on Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and Seller resolve all of the disputed
items in such Dispute Notice during such thirty (30)-day period, the Final
Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution, and as so
revised shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller. If
Purchaser and Seller, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to resolve
all of the Objections within such thirty (30)-day period (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree), then at the end of such period Purchaser
and Seller shall jointly engage BDO Siedman LLP or, if such firm is unwilling
to serve in such capacity, another nationally-recognized accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller (the " ** _Accounting
Arbitrator_** "), and shall instruct such firm to review and resolve
exclusively all of the unresolved Objections (and no other matters contained
in the Final Closing Statement) (acting as an expert and not an arbitrator) in
accordance with this Agreement (including _Section 1.5(e)_) as soon as
practicable thereafter (but in any event within thirty (30) days after
engagement of the Accounting Arbitrator). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct
the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver a written report containing its
calculation of the disputed Objections within such thirty (30)-day period.
Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to not assign a
dollar amount to any Objection greater than the greatest dollar amount for
such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, or lower than the lowest dollar amount for such item assigned by
Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. All Objections that
are determined by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final, conclusive
and binding on Purchaser and Seller, absent manifest error, effective as of
the date the Accounting Arbitrators written determination is received by
Purchaser and Seller and shall be enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Final Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such
resolution and the Final Closing Statement, as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 1.5(b)(i)_ shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Purchaser and Seller. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator incurred in connection with the resolution of

 



       
 

 



 

disputes pursuant to this _Section 1.5(c)_ shall be borne entirely by (A)
Purchaser, if (I) the difference between the Net Increase or Net Decrease (as
applicable) based on Purchasers position with respect to each Objection
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution, and the amount of the
Net Increase or Net Decrease determined based upon the Final Closing Statement
is greater than (II) the difference between the Net Increase or Net Decrease
(as applicable) based on Sellers position with respect to each Objection
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution, and the amount of the
Net Increase or Net Decrease determined based upon the Final Closing Statement
or (B) by Seller in all other cases.

 



 

(d) _Payment following Calculation of Final Closing Statement_.

 



 

(i) If the Final Closing Statement includes a Net Increase, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller cash in the amount of such Net Increase within five (5) Business
Days after it becomes final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Seller may
designate to Purchaser reasonably in advance of such payment.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Closing Statement includes a Net Decrease, Seller shall pay
to Purchaser cash in the amount of such Net Decrease within five (5) Business
Days after it becomes final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Purchaser may
designate to Seller reasonably in advance of such payment.

 



 

If any Party fails to pay any amount when due under this _Section 1.5(d)_,
such unpaid amount shall thereafter bear simple interest at a rate equal to
the prime rate in effect from time to time (as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ ) plus two (2) percentage points, until paid in full.

 



 

(e) _Accounting Procedures_. The Closing Statement, the Final Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with the accounting methods, practices,
policies and principles set forth on _Schedule 1.5_. Such statements,
calculations and determinations (i) shall not include any purchase accounting
or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall follow the defined terms contained
in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with GAAP and (iii)
shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a
pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month. By way of
example, the calculation of Working Capital (forecasted) as of March 31, 2015
is also set forth on _Schedule 1.5_.

 



 

(f) _Treatment of Payments_. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.5_
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

1.6 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payments of consideration with respect to the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Purchaser or the
Company is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any other
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Purchaser or

 



      
 

 



 

the Company and properly deposited with the applicable Governmental Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made.

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have
been duly authorized and approved by all required action on the part of Parent
and Purchaser.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Purchaser and each Transaction Document to which Purchaser will be
a party will be, at and as of the Closing, duly and validly executed and

Parent and Purchaser (to the extent that they are a party thereto),
enforceable against Parent and Purchaser (to the extent that they are a party

4.3 _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.3_ of the Purchaser

passage of time or the giving of notice or both, constitute a default) under,
or result in or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
acceleration or cancellation of any obligation under, any Contract to which
Purchaser is a party or by which it or its properties or assets are bound.

acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act
or qualified under applicable state securities laws and understands the
restrictions on resale of the Shares imposed by the Securities Act and such
applicable state securities laws. The Purchaser also acknowledges that Seller
has no obligation to register the Shares, that there is presently no public
market for the Shares, that there may never be a public market for the Shares,
and that, even if such a market develops, Purchaser may never be able to sell

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as

and in any event in accordance with applicable Law with any such inquiry or
request.

 



 

(e) _Limitation on Obligations_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 5.4_ shall obligate any Party to waive or amend any condition
set forth in _Article VII_ or any underlying representation, warranty,

(a) provide to Purchaser and the employees, directors, officers, agents or
representatives of Purchaser (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser

access, during normal business hours, and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Acquired Business, to (i) the
facilities, assets, properties, books and records of the Company and (ii) the
employees, directors, officers, agents or representatives of the Company or
Seller (collectively, the " ** _Seller Representatives_** "), (b) furnish to
Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives such documents, additional

and the Purchaser Representatives are not prohibited from contacting any such

by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents). Prior to the Closing,
all information disclosed by or on behalf of Seller and the Company to

to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

 



 

5.6 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall not, and shall

indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage, entertain, facilitate or participate
in any inquiries, proposals or offers from, discuss or negotiate with, provide
any information to, consider the merits of any inquiries, proposals or offers
from, or enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or Contract with, any
Person (other than Purchaser), in each case relating to (a) any sale,
assignment or transfer of any of the Shares or any direct or indirect interest
therein, (b) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination
or other similar transaction involving Seller or the Company, (c) any sale of
any assets or properties of the Company outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business, other than solely with respect to the Divestiture or the Cloud and
Hosted Services Business, or (d) any issue by the Company of any capital stock
or other equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for (including any rights, warrants or options to acquire) any
such capital stock, other equity securities or other securities, (any such
transaction referred to in the

 



      
 

 



 

preceding _clauses (a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ , an " ** _Alternative
Transaction_** "). If, during the Pre-Closing Period, Seller or any of the
Seller Representatives receives any inquiry, offer or proposal concerning a
proposed Alternative Transaction, Seller shall not (and shall cause the Seller
Representatives to not) make any written or oral response to such inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than to state that a contractual obligation precludes
a substantive response) and shall provide written notice to Purchaser,
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) of receipt or
awareness of such inquiry, offer or proposal by Seller or any of the Seller
Representatives, which notice shall include a reasonable description of the
material terms and conditions of the proposed Alternative Transaction
(including the identity of the Person making the inquiry, offer or proposal)
and accurate and complete copies of any documents supplied by such Person in

the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall notify the other as soon
are reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days)
after becoming aware of (a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of its or
their representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that is
qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, (b) any material breach
of, or inaccuracy in, any of its or their representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement that is not qualified by materiality or Material
Adverse Effect, (c) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of its or their
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) any change, effect,
matter, event, fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected to cause
a condition to the other Parties obligation to consummate the Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ to not be satisfied prior to the Termination Date.
Except as provided in the next sentence, such notice shall not (i) be deemed
to supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule or any such representation and warranty or covenant and
agreement of the Company, Seller or Purchaser for the purpose of determining
whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied
or (ii) affect the right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent such notice is from Seller and
(A) relates to _Section 2.8(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.8(a)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (relating to customers and suppliers), _Section 2.8(b)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (ageing of accounts receivable), _Section
2.10_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (relating to Material Contracts, but
solely with respect to the additions to or deletions of any Material Contracts
thereon arising in the Ordinary Course of Business), _Section 2.14_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (relating to employment agreements and offer
letters, but solely with respect to the additions to or deletions of any
Contracts or offer letters thereon arising in the Ordinary Course of Business)
or _Section 2.18_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (relating to the list of
insurance policies, but solely with respect to the additions to or deletions
of any insurance policies thereon arising in the Ordinary Course of Business)
and (B) the disclosure in such notice is only as to changes that do not result
from a non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant of the Company or Seller set
forth in this Agreement (or, with respect to deletions from _Section 2.10_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, that do not result from or relate to any
breach or other non-performance of any Contract), from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights it and all other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties may have arising from or

 



      
 

 



 

relating to a breach of representation or warranty with respect to such
sections that is described in such notice (including any right to
indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_); _provided, however_ , that no
such waiver shall apply if and to the extent the breach described in such
notice related to the failure of a representation or warranty of the Company
or Seller to be true and correct on and as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

5.8 _Purchaser Financing_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary in order to obtain debt financing to provide
funding for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (the " ** _Financing_** "), it being acknowledged by
Purchaser that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably apprised
of the status of the Financing.

 



 

(b) Seller and the Company shall from time to time as and when requested by
Purchaser, provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser in connection with
Purchasers efforts to obtain the Financing, as Purchaser may reasonably
request. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and
Seller shall, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
other Seller Representatives to, at the request of Purchaser (i) participate
in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) (A) furnish
Purchaser, as promptly as reasonably practicable following Purchasers
request, with such pertinent and customary information, to the extent
reasonably available to the Company or Seller, regarding the Company and the
Acquired Business, as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate
the Financing and with information regarding the Company and the Acquired
Business (including information to be used in the preparation of one or more
information packages regarding the business, operations, financial projections
and prospects of the Company and the Acquired Business), in each case, which
is reasonable and customary for the arrangement of loans contemplated by the
Financing and to the extent reasonably available to the Company, Seller or the
Seller Representatives (collectively, the " ** _Required Information_** ") and
(iii) execute and deliver customary certificates or other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees (but not any personal guarantees of any
Seller or Affiliates other than the Company), the pledge of collateral and
other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation under any such
certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Closing and
Seller shall not and, prior to the Closing, the Company shall not, be required
to pay any commitment or other fee or other amount in connection with the
Financing.

 



 

5.9 _Outstanding Letters of Credit and Guarantees_.

 



 

(a) _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
list of the letters of credit and corporate guarantees issued in support of
the Acquired Business by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Company) for the benefit of third parties (the " ** _Scheduled
Guarantees_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide a
replacement guarantee, letter of credit, security or other collateral from
Purchaser to the third party beneficiary of each Scheduled Guarantee, and to
obtain from the respective beneficiary of such Scheduled Guarantee, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, valid and binding written
releases of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), as applicable,
from any liability arising after the Closing Date under such Scheduled
Guarantees with effect as of the Closing. If, after expending its commercially
reasonable efforts, Purchaser is unable to procure such a release prior to the
Closing, then Purchaser shall continue to expend such efforts after the
Closing, and until such time as Purchaser is able to obtain such a release, or
if earlier until such time as (i) the end of the then current term of the
Contract associated with such Scheduled Guarantee in accordance with its
terms, if applicable, or (ii) the satisfaction of the underlying obligations
which such Scheduled Guarantee supports, if applicable, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and
not terminate such Scheduled Guarantee.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall after the Closing indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates from any liabilities to the extent arising out of or related to
a claim against any Scheduled Guarantees related to events or circumstances
occurring after the Closing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no breach or
violation of any agreement as the result of any failure to replace any such
letter of credit or corporate guarantee shall constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement or cause any condition
precedent set forth in _Section 7.1_ not to be satisfied.

 



 

5.10 _Publicity_. Except and solely to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange or permitted by this _Section 5.10_, no
Party shall make or permit any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the existence of or subject matter of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
without the prior written consent of Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and
Seller agree on a press release, then each of the Company, Seller, Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates may issue further press releases and similar
announcements without the consent of Purchaser or Seller; _provided_ that each
such press release or similar announcement contains, with respect to the
information concerning this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, solely the information that is
contained in the initial press release. To the extent any such press release
or other public announcement is required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange,
the disclosing party shall provide reasonable advance written notice thereof
to Purchaser and Seller and consult with the non-disclosing parties concerning
the contents of the public announcement.

 



 

5.11 _280G Matters._ Before the Closing Date, the Company shall (a) submit to
all Persons entitled to vote (within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations
under Section 280G of the Code) the material facts concerning all payments and
benefits that, in the absence of shareholder approval of such payments and
benefits, would constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code (" ** _Parachute Payments_** "), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and its counsel, which will satisfy all

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and (b) take all necessary actions (including soliciting any
required waivers of any such Parachute Payments or other consents from any
applicable "disqualified individuals," within the meaning of the Treasury
Regulations under Section 280G of the Code) in order to solicit the approval
and consent of all such Persons with respect to any Parachute Payments (the "
** _280G Stockholder Approval_** "). Purchaser shall have the right to review
and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) all documents and materials relating to the 280G Stockholder Approval
in advance of the 280G Stockholder Approval.

 



 

5.12 _Cooperation with Audit_. The Company and Seller acknowledge that
following the date of this Agreement Purchaser may conduct, at Purchasers
expense, an audit of the financial statements for the Acquired Business or of
the Company after giving effect to the disposition of its Network Services and
Cloud and Hosted Services businesses. The Company (prior to the Closing) and
Seller (after the Closing) shall, and each of them shall cause their
respective Affiliates (including for Seller, CloudCo after the Closing) to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and its
accountants in connection with such audit and to provide Purchaser and its
accountants with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser
or its accountants in connection with such audit, which assistance may include
(a) assistance in the preparation of books and records of the Company
separating the Acquired Business from the Companys Network Services and Cloud
and Hosted Services Businesses and making appropriate allocations of accounting
and financial items among such businesses and (b) making employees,
information, records and other reasonably requested materials available on a
mutually convenient basis to assist in the conduct of such audit. The Company
(prior to the Closing) and Seller (after the Closing) shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including for Seller, CloudCo after the Closing) to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to also provide such additional information
available to Seller and its Affiliates which is relevant and reasonably
necessary to enable Purchaser and its accountants to prepare and audit such
financial statements in compliance with the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission applicable to Parent, and any registration statement,
report or disclosure statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by, or on behalf of, Parent. In connection with the foregoing
audit(s), and in furtherance of the obligations of the Company and Seller to
assist Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.12_, the Company (prior to the
Closing) and Seller (after the Closing) covenants and agrees to execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to Purchasers accountants audit
representation letters with respect to the period prior to the Closing as
reasonably requested by Purchaser or its accountants.

 



 

5.13 _The Divestiture_ _._

 



 

(a) The Divesture shall be consummated by (i) the contribution by the Company
of certain assets to CloudCo as provided in the Contribution Agreement (the "
** _Contributed Assets_** "), (ii) the assumption by CloudCo of certain
liabilities of the Company as provided in the Contribution Agreement (the " **
_Assumed Liabilities_** "), (iii) the transferring by the Company of certain
employees to CloudCo or an Affiliate of Cloudco as contemplated by the

that is fourteen (14) days following the date of this Agreement (the " **
_Allocation Date_** ") (i) the assets of the Company that will be Contributed
Assets, (ii) the liabilities of the Company that will be Assumed Liabilities,
and (iii) the employees of the Company who will be Transferred Employees.

 



 

(c) For the purposes of the allocations required by _Section 5.13(b)_, Seller
and Purchaser agree as follows:

 



 

(i) all Employees other than the Acquired Company Employees will be
Transferred Employees and any severance liabilities associated with such
Employees will be Assumed Liabilities;

 



 

(ii) all of the Companys office leases other than those for the Companys
facilities at Costa Mesa, California and Austin, Texas will be Contributed
Assets;

 



 

(iii) the determination of the current assets and the current liabilities of
the Company that will be Contributed Assets and Assumed Liabilities will be
made in a manner consistent with the manner in which Purchaser and Seller
ultimately determine Actual Working Capital;

 



 

(iv) any asset (including any Contract, other than the office leases that are
addressed in the preceding _clause (ii)_ ) that is used exclusively in or
relates exclusively to the Cloud and Hosted Services Business will be a
Contributed Asset;

 



 

(vi) any liability that arises exclusively from or relates exclusively to the
Cloud and Hosted Services Business (or that arises exclusively from or relates
exclusively to any Contributed Asset) shall be an Assumed Liability; and

 



 

(vii) with respect to any asset (including any Contract, other than the office
leases that are addressed in the preceding _clause (ii)_ ) that is not used
exclusively in or relate exclusively to either the Cloud and Hosted Services
Business or the Acquired Business (any such asset, a " ** _Shared Asset_** ")
or any liability that does not arise exclusively from or relate exclusively to
the Cloud and Hosted Services Business or the Acquired Business (any such
liability, a " ** _Shared Liability_** "), Seller and Purchaser will work
together in good faith to allocate such assets and liabilities in a fair and
equitable manner, taking into account (A) the business in which such Shared
Asset is primarily used or to which such Shared Asset primarily relates, (B)
the business from which such Shared Liability primarily arose or to which such
Shared Liability primarily relates, (C) the relative value and importance of
such Shared Asset to the Cloud and Hosted Services Business as compared to its
value and importance to the Acquired Business after the Closing, (D) in the
case of any Contract that is a Shared Asset, the ease of allocating the
benefits and obligations under such Contract to one business or the other as
contemplated by _Section 5.14_, (E) the relative costs which the Cloud and
Hosted Services Business and the Acquired Business will incur to replace such
Shared Asset if such Shared Asset is not allocated to it and (F) such other
considerations they may deem appropriate.

 



      
 

 



 

5.14 _Shared Contracts_ _. _Seller and Purchaser shall, and Seller shall cause
the Company and CloudCo to, work together in good faith to mutually determine
on or before the Allocation Date (a) all of the Contracts that relate to both
the Acquired Business and the Cloud and Hosted Services Business (the " **
_Shared Contracts_** ") and (b) for each Shared Contract, whether such Shared
Contract is to be retained by the Company or to be assigned to CloudCo as part
of the Divestiture pursuant to the Contribution Agreement. For each Shared
Contract, the Transition Services Agreement shall provide for a mutually
agreeable arrangement by which each applicable Party that is not a party to
such Contract following the Closing would be able to obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations to or under such Contract in accordance with such
Contract with respect to the business operated by such Party (including by
subcontracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing to the applicable Party that is
not a party to such Contract, or by an arrangement under which the Party that
is a party to such Contract would enforce for the benefit of such other Party,
any and all rights of such Party that is a party to the Contract against a
third party thereto), in each case without mark-up or premium except as except
as expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement, with the Party
that is not a party to such Contract assuming the obligations to such third
party thereto with respect to the business operated by such Party, in each
case without mark-up or premium except as expressly provided in the Transition
Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) with respect to any
Contract other than a Shared Contract that was intended to be assigned to
CloudCo pursuant to the Contribution Agreement but was not so assigned in
accordance with Section 2.1 thereof, Cloudco will reimburse to the Company all
costs incurred by the Company in maintaining such Contract, without mark-up or
premium, and (ii) with respect to any Shared Contract that was intended to be
assigned to CloudCo pursuant to the Contribution Agreement but was not so
assigned in accordance with Section 2.1 thereof, Cloudco will reimburse to the
Company all incremental costs incurred by the Company in maintaining such
Contract, without mark-up or premium, that would not have been incurred by the
Company if such Contract had been assigned to CloudCo.

 



 

5.15 _Commercial Agreements and Shared Services_ _. _Purchaser shall, and
Seller and the Company shall cause CloudCo to, work together in good faith to
negotiate and prepare (a) mutually agreeable commercial agreements
incorporating terms and conditions consistent with those set forth on _Exhibit
D_ attached hereto and (b) the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement
(including the services to be provided and the terms and conditions upon which
such services shall be provided).

resulting from the 338(h)(10) Election, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 6.2_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare IRS Form 8023 (" ** _Form 8023_**") and any
corresponding state, local or foreign Tax forms and shall furnish such forms
to Seller, for Sellers completion and execution, no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date such forms are required to be filed with any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall deliver Form 8023 to Seller, for
Sellers completion and execution, no less than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. Seller shall (and, as necessary, cause any Person that is
treated as the owner of such Shares for Income Tax purposes to) promptly and
properly complete and execute all such forms Purchaser provides to Seller and
return the appropriately completed and executed copies to Purchaser for timely
filing by Purchaser with the applicable Governmental Authority no less than
five (5) days prior to the date such forms are required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority; _provided_ , that Seller shall return the
appropriately completed and executed copy of Form 8023 to Purchaser on or
prior to the Closing Date, in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

 



 

(c) The Purchase Price, the liabilities of the Company and any other relevant
items (the " ** _338(h)(10) Consideration_**") shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company (the " ** _Assets_** ") in accordance with this _Section
6.1(c)_ (the " ** _Allocation_** "). As promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, but in any event within one hundred eighty (180) days thereof,
Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a draft
Allocation in accordance with Code Section 338(h)(10) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the " ** _Draft Allocation_** "). If Seller does not
deliver to Purchaser a written objection to the Draft Allocation, setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such objection, within thirty
(30) days after their receipt of the Draft Allocation, then the Draft
Allocation shall become final and binding upon the Parties (the " ** _Final
Allocation_** "). If Seller timely delivers such objection to Purchaser, then
Seller and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any dispute, and if
all items of dispute are so resolved, then the Draft Allocation shall be
amended accordingly and shall become the Final Allocation. If any dispute with
respect to the Draft Allocation remains unresolved for a period of twenty (20)
days after Purchaser receives Sellers objection notice, then Purchaser and
Seller shall submit only the remaining disputed items to a the Accounting
Arbitrator for determination. The Accounting Arbitrators determination as to
each such disputed item shall be binding on the Parties, and the Draft
Allocation shall be amended in accordance with the Accounting Arbitrators
determination and shall become the Final Allocation. Purchaser shall prepare
IRS Form 8883 (and any similar form for purposes of state, local or foreign
Tax Law) for each of "Old Target" and "New Target" (as defined for purposes of
Treasury Regulations 1.338(h)(10)-1) consistent with the Final Allocation, and
Purchaser, on behalf of the Company, shall timely file or cause to be filed
such Form 8883 and other forms with the appropriate Governmental Authority. If
any adjustment is subsequently made to the 338(h)(10) Consideration pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Seller agrees to execute and deliver promptly
to Purchaser such other Tax forms relating to the 338(h)(10) Election as
Purchaser may reasonably request, and Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser to
file any and all forms with respect to the 338(h)(10) Election. The Form 8883
and other forms shall be binding on Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates for all Tax purposes, and each such Person shall file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Form 8883 and other forms; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) the amount realized by Seller may differ from the
amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount
realized for Income Tax purposes and (ii) Purchasers cost for the assets that
it is deemed to acquire may differ from the amount allocated hereunder to
reflect the inclusion in

 



       
 

 



 

the total cost of items (for example, capitalized acquisition costs) not
included in the amount so allocated. None of Seller, the Company, Purchaser or
their respective Affiliates shall take any position on any Tax Return, before
any Governmental Authority or in any Proceeding relating to Taxes that is in
any way inconsistent with the Form 8883.

 



 

(d) Seller shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item
resulting from the 338(h)(10) Election on Sellers Tax Returns to the extent
and in the manner required by applicable Law, and shall timely file such Tax
Returns and pay the Taxes reported on such Tax Returns. Seller shall also be
responsible for and shall pay any Tax imposed on the Company attributable to
the making of the 338(h)(10) Election, including any Tax imposed under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2).

 



 

6.2 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall (A) prepare and timely file
(or cause the Company to prepare and timely file) all Tax Returns of the
Company due (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) on or prior
to the Closing Date (the " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_** "), all
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes
that include Seller and the Company (the " ** _Consolidated Returns_** ") and
all other Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes of the Company with a
taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the " ** _Other Income
Tax Returns_** ", and, together with the Consolidated Returns and the Pre-
Closing Tax Returns, the " ** _Seller Prepared Returns_** ") and (B) timely
pay (or cause the Company to timely pay) all Taxes that are shown as payable
with respect to such Seller Prepared Returns. All Seller Prepared Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with existing procedures, practices, and
accounting methods of the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. Each Seller Prepared Return shall be submitted to Purchaser for
Purchasers review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date
of such Seller Prepared Return (taking into account extensions); _provided_ ,
that with respect to any Consolidated Return, Seller shall only be required to
deliver a pro forma Tax Return for the Company. Seller shall incorporate any
reasonable comments made by Purchaser in such Seller Prepared Return prior to
filing.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than the
Consolidated Returns and the Other Income Tax Returns) that are due after the
Closing Date (the " ** _Purchaser Prepared Returns_** "). To the extent that a
Purchaser Prepared Return relates solely to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, such Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with
existing procedures, practices, and accounting methods of the Company, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Purchaser Prepared Return shall be
submitted to the Seller for the Sellers review and comment at least twenty
(20) days prior to the due date of such Purchaser Prepared Return (taking into
account extensions). Purchaser shall consider any comments of the Seller in
good faith. No failure or delay in the Purchaser providing Purchaser Prepared
Returns for Seller to

 



      
 

 



 

review shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of
Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) Seller shall claim all Income Tax deductions permitted to be claimed by
applicable Law with respect to the payment of any Company Transaction Expenses
and the payment of any Company Indebtedness at or after the Closing pursuant
to _Section 1.3(a)_ (except with respect to any Indebtedness identified on
_Schedule 1.2(g)_ ) in the final Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall not take any action, or
permit the Company to take any action, inconsistent therewith, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Apportionment of Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount
of any Taxes of the Company (i) based on or measured by income or receipts,
sales or use, employment, or withholding for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) the
amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. Purchaser, the Company and Seller shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely
filing of any Tax Return of the Company, (ii) assist in any audit or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, (iii) make
available any information, records or other documents relating to any Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company, and (iv) provide any information necessary or
reasonably requested to allow Purchaser or the Company to comply with any
information reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code or
other applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Tax Contests_. Purchaser shall notify Seller within thirty (30) days upon
the receipt of any notice, or becoming aware, of any audit or other similar
examination with respect to Taxes for which Seller would reasonably be
expected to be liable pursuant to this Agreement (a " ** _Tax Contest_** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , no failure or delay of Purchaser in providing such
notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of Seller pursuant to
this Agreement, except to the extent that Seller is materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay. Purchaser shall control, or
cause the Company to control, the conduct of any Tax Contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to
participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates solely to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any Tax
Contest relates solely to a Consolidated Return, Seller shall have the right
to control such Tax Contest.

 



 

6.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser and Seller shall each be liable for one-half
(1/2) of all sales, use, transfer, stamp, duties, documentary, registration,
recording and other similar Taxes and related fees and penalties incurred as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " **
_Transfer Taxes_** "). Purchaser shall file or shall cause the Company to

 



      
 

 



 

file all required Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes. To the extent
practicable, the amount of such Transfer Taxes shall be calculated prior to
the Closing Date, and payment shall be made by Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, to settle the obligations provided in this _Section 6.3_. To the
extent Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser or the Company, on the other
hand, pays or becomes obligated to pay any such Transfer Taxes after the
Closing that was not identified and paid at the Closing in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Seller or Purchaser may, from time to time or at any time,
notify the other of such unpaid Transfer Taxes, which notice shall be
accompanied by evidence of such the payment or obligation to pay such Transfer
Taxes and the amount of such Transfer Taxes. Promptly, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, shall pay to the Party that delivered such notice its
proportionate share of such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

6.4 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company to, provide Seller and its authorized representatives with
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books, records
(including accountants work papers), properties, facilities and employees of
the Company with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date in connection
with financial reporting, Tax Return preparation or Tax compliance matters of
Seller (whether or not relating to periods prior to the Closing Date).
Purchaser and Seller agree that any access or other rights under this _Section
6.4_ shall be provided only after reasonable advance written request by
Seller, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and the Company
so that such access or other rights do not unreasonably disrupt the operations
of the Company. Subject to _Section 6.2_, the Parties agree and acknowledge
that Purchaser may condition its obligations under this _Section 6.4_ on
receipt from Seller of a customary agreement restricting use and disclosure by
Seller of the information provided by Purchaser or the Company to Seller or
otherwise obtained by Seller in exercising its rights under this _Section
6.4_. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Seller, Purchaser shall not
permit the Company, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing
Date, to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of its material books and
records, or any material portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date and matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby without first giving at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Seller and offering to surrender to Seller such books and
records or such portions thereof.

 



 

6.5 _Restrictive Covenants of Seller_. As a material inducement to Purchaser
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Seller hereby agrees as follows:

 



 

(a) _Confidentiality_. Seller shall not, and shall cause each of Sellers
Affiliates to not, at any time after the Closing, disclose to any Person or
use for any purpose other than exercising Sellers rights and performing
Sellers obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which Seller is a party, any Confidential Information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and Sellers Affiliates may make such disclosures of
Confidential Information as are required under applicable Law, in each case as
long as Seller (i) provides reasonable advance notice of such requirement to
Purchaser so that Purchaser may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy, (ii) reasonably cooperates with Purchaser to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall
be

 



      
 

 



 

accorded to such information and (iii) discloses only such information as
Seller is advised by outside legal counsel in writing that Seller is legally
required to disclose.

 



 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(i) Seller shall not, and shall cause each of Sellers Affiliates to not,
directly or indirectly, at any time during the period from the Closing Date
through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) solicit for
employment or in any other way induce or attempt to induce to leave the employ
of or engagement by Purchaser or the Company, any Person who is, on the date
of such solicitation or attempted inducement, a director, officer, employee or
consultant to Purchaser or the Company; or (B) induce or attempt to induce any
Person who is a director, officer, employee or consultant to Purchaser or the
Company to leave the employ of or terminate or breach their respective
agreements with Purchaser or the Company, or in any other way deliberately
interfere with the relationship between Purchaser or the Company and any such
Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that no general advertisement or general
solicitation of employment not targeted to the directors, officers, employees
or consultants of Purchaser or the Company shall be deemed to be a
solicitation of such individuals in violation of this _Section 6.5(b)(i)_; or

 



 

(ii) Seller shall not, and shall cause each of MegaPath Holding Corporation,
CloudCo and any future Subsidiary of MegaPath Holding Corporation to not,
directly or indirectly, at any time during the period from the Closing Date
through the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date (A) solicit, attempt
to solicit, or assist any other Person in soliciting or attempting to solicit,
any business of the type conducted by the Acquired Business or by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date from any Person who is a
customer or referral source of the Company with respect to the Acquired
Business as of the Closing Date or who was a customer or referral source of
the Company with respect to the Acquired Business at any time during the six
(6)-month period preceding the Closing Date or (B) take any action to
deliberately interfere with the relationship between the Company and Person
who is a lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, licensee or other business
associate or relation of the Company with respect to the Acquired Business
prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that the provisions of this
_Section 6.5(b)(ii)_ shall not apply with respect to VoIP services (and only
VoIP services) provided by CloudCo.

 



 

(c) _Authority for Judicial Enforcement and Revision_. Seller agrees and
acknowledges that the covenants of Seller set forth in this _Section 6.5_ (i)
are reasonable in geographic and temporal scope and in all other respects and
(ii) have been made in order to induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser would not
have entered into this Agreement or consummated the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case but for the covenants of Seller contained in this
_Section 6.5_. If, at any time of enforcement of any of the provisions of
this _Section 6.5_, a Governmental Authority determines that the duration,
scope or area restrictions stated herein are not enforceable under applicable
Law, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area (as
applicable) permitted by applicable Law shall be substituted for the duration,
area or scope (as applicable) stated herein and the Governmental Authority
shall be authorized by the Parties to revise the restrictions contained herein
to cover such maximum duration, area or scope

 



      
 

 



 

(as applicable). This _Section 6.5(c)_ shall be read in conjunction with (and
not to the exclusion of) _Section 10.6_ (Severability).

 



 

(d) _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that any breach or attempted breach
of this _Section 6.5_ would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser, which
cannot be adequately compensated in monetary damages. Therefore, Purchaser
shall have, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any of the other rights and
remedies available hereunder, the right to have the provisions of this
_Section 6.5_ specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction by
way of an injunction or other equitable relief. Purchaser shall not be
required to post a bond or other security or to prove actual damages or the
inadequacy of monetary damages in connection with its efforts to obtain
equitable relief concerning this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(e) _Exercise of Certain Rights_. With respect to each Person who is an
executive of the Company on the date of this Agreement and who will cease to
be an employee of the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing in order
to become an employee of Seller, MegaPath Holding Corporation or CloudCo,
Seller shall take such actions as shall be necessary and appropriate to either
(i) ensure that the Company will remain an express third party beneficiary of
any contractual covenant not to compete, covenant not to solicit or similar
agreement that is in effect with the Company on the date of this Agreement or
(ii) enforce, or cause MegaPath Holding Corporation or CloudCo to enforce,
such restrictive covenants from time-to-time at the request of the Company for
the benefit of the Company as the same may be applicable to the Acquired
Business, and Seller shall not, and shall cause MegaPath Holding Corporation
and CloudCo not to, waive such restrictive covenants as the same may be
applicable to the Acquired Business.

 



 

6.6 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party, each other Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable (and at the cost and expense of such
requesting Party, except to the extent such cost or expense constitutes a Loss
for which such Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article
VIII_) to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, if, after the Closing, Purchaser or the Company, on the one
hand, or Seller or any Affiliate of Seller identify (i) any tangible or
intangible property or other asset in the possession of Seller or its
Affiliates that is owned, or has been used or held for use in the operation of
the Acquired Business by the Company, other than any such property or asset
that is shared between the Acquired Business and the Cloud and Hosted Services
Business and is addressed in the Transition Services Agreement, or (ii) any
Contract to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party that Purchaser or the
Company confirms is intended to be for the benefit of the Company, other than
any such Contract that is shared between the Acquired Business and the Cloud and
Hosted Services Business and is addressed in the Transition Services
Agreement, then, in each case, unless specifically addressed in the
Contribution Agreement, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, as the
case may be, deliver or convey such property or other asset, or assign such
Contract, to the Company, accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer
or assignment, as the case may be, but without any further consideration being
required from

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser or the Company in connection with such conveyance, delivery or
assignment, as the case may be.

 



 

6.7 _Netco Transaction_. For the avoidance of doubt, all funds remaining in
the third-party escrow account established in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Netco Purchase Agreement are for the benefit of, and shall
be released to, Seller and its Affiliates other than the Company, and are not
for the benefit of the Company. Subject to the provisions of _Article VIII_,
Seller and its Affiliates other than the Company shall control any Proceeding
related to such escrowed funds or any claim for indemnification under the
Netco Purchase Agreement, and Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at Sellers expense, to cooperate and assist Seller and
its Affiliates in any such matter that arises after the Closing, including
providing such access to certain information in accordance with in _Section
6.4_ as may be reasonably requested by Seller or its Affiliates in connection
with any such matter.

 



 

6.8 _Use of Trademarks; Name Change_ _. _Purchaser acknowledges that all
rights of the Company in and to any of the MegaPath Marks shall be transferred
to an Affiliate of Seller as part of the Divestiture. Following the Closing,
Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to (i) change the legal name of the
Company to a name that does not contain the word "MegaPath" or any similar
word and (ii) ensure that neither Purchaser, nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) market or brand any products or services of the
Company using any MegaPath Marks or otherwise use the MegaPath Marks at any
time for any reason; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and the Company
shall have the right, with respect to inventory, supplies, marketing
materials, signs and other items used in the Acquired Business immediately
prior to the Closing that contain or display MegaPath Marks, to use the
MegaPath Marks in the manner and to the extent used by the Acquired Business
prior to the Closing, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser and the Company a
non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to use the MegaPath Marks in
such manner and to such extent, for such period of time as is necessary to
exhaust all such inventory and supplies and replace such signs, marketing
materials and other items with similar assets that do not contain or display
any MegaPath Marks. Purchaser shall take, and cause the Company to take, such
actions as are necessary to replace such signs, marketing materials and other
items as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing and to exhaust
such inventory and supplies in the ordinary course of business. All links
between any domain name included within the Acquired Business and any domain
names of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be removed as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in taking
all actions necessary to complete these actions.

 



 

6.9 _Financial Statements for the Acquired Business_ _. _On or before April
15, 2015, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser (a) the
unaudited balance sheets of the Acquired Business as at December 31, 2012 and
2013, together with the related unaudited statements of income, stockholders
equity and cash flows of the Acquired Business for the years then ended and
(b) the unaudited statements of stockholders equity and cash flows of the
Acquired Business for the year ended December 31, 2014 (collectively, the " **
_Prior Carve-Out Financial Statements_** "). Except as set forth in _Section
2.6(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, each of the Prior Carve-Out
Financial Statements when delivered will have been, (a)

 



      
 

 



 

prepared in accordance with the accounting methods, practices, policies and
principles set forth on _Schedule 1.5_ consistently applied as at the dates
thereof and for the periods covered thereby, and (b) prepared, in all material
respects, based upon the books and records of the Company, and each of the
Prior Carve-Out Financial Statements when delivered will present, fairly the
financial condition of the Acquired Business as of its respective date and the
results of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Business for the periods
then ended, as applicable.

Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that: (a) the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 2.17_ (Tax) shall
survive the Closing until sixty (60) days after expiration of the applicable

thereof) for the matters described in such representations and warranties and

and agreement of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall each survive
the Closing and shall terminate on the date sixty (60) days after the running

or tolling thereof) with respect to the subject matter of such covenant and
agreement, except for those covenants and agreements that contain specific
survival periods (which shall each survive the Closing and shall terminate on
the last day of such specific survival period).

 



 

8.2 _Expiration of Indemnification_. No Notice of Claim (a) concerning a
breach of or inaccuracy in a representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement or a non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by
or to be performed by a Party set forth in this Agreement may be delivered by

delivered by a Person seeking indemnification after the date ninety (90) days
after the running of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
subject matter of such indemnification; _provided, however_ , in the case of
each of the preceding _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , if a Notice of Claim
concerning any of the foregoing matters has been delivered in accordance with
_Section 8.4(a)_ or _Section 8.5(a)_ by a Person seeking indemnification
prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the preceding _clauses (a)_
or _(b)_ , as applicable, the right to indemnification with respect to the
matter set forth in such Notice of Claim and any other claim(s) arising out
of, resulting from or relating to the facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification shall survive until such later date as each such claim for
indemnification has been fully and finally resolved in accordance with this
_Article VIII_.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification by the Parties_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_, Seller hereby
agrees, from and after the Closing, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser, Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

each of Purchasers and Parents Affiliates and each of the officers,
directors, managers, members, partners, equityholders, employees,
representatives, agents, successors and assigns of Purchaser, Parent and such
Affiliates (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_** ") from
and against, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each Purchaser Indemnified
Party in respect of, any and all Losses incurred, suffered, sustained or
required to be paid, directly or indirectly, by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i) any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation and warranty made by the Company or Seller in
_Article II_ or by Seller in _Article III_, (ii) any non-fulfillment or
breach of any covenant or agreement made by or to be performed by Seller set
forth in this Agreement, (iii) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant
or agreement made by or to be performed by the Company at or prior to the
Closing, (iv) any Indemnified Taxes, (v) any Liability of the Company arising
or relating to the Pre-Closing Period that is not primarily related to the
conduct of the Acquired Business, (vi) any Liabilities that are "Assumed
Liabilities" as that term is defined in the Contribution Agreement or (vii)
any Liability of the Company arising out of or relating to the claims referred
to in _Section 2.13_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule under the heading
"Open Litigation" and identified as "Enqwest, LLC" in the column titled
"Name". Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, no
Seller Indemnified Party will be a Purchaser Indemnified Party by reason of
such Seller Indemnified Partys position with the Company or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_, Parent and
Purchaser hereby agree, from and after the Closing, to jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, each of Sellers Affiliates and
each of its and their respective officers, directors, managers, members,
partners, equityholders, employees, representatives, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " ** _Seller Indemnified Parties_** ") from and
against, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each Seller Indemnified Party in
respect of, any and all Losses incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be
paid, directly or indirectly, by any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of,
resulting from or relating to (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation and warranty made by Parent or Purchaser in _Article IV_ or
(ii) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by or to
be performed by Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedure_.

 



 

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable (in the capacity as a Person seeking indemnification under this
_Article VIII_, the " ** _Indemnified Party_** "), obtains actual knowledge
of any matter not involving a Third Party Claim that the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes will entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification from
Purchaser or Seller under this _Article VIII_ (in the capacity as a Person
against whom indemnification is sought under this _Article VIII_, the " **
_Indemnifying Party_** "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly thereafter
deliver to the Indemnifying Party a notice thereof (a " ** _Notice of Claim_**
") describing such matter in reasonable detail and, to the extent reasonably
estimable, the estimated Losses resulting therefrom; _provided, however_ ,
that any failure to give such notification on a timely basis or to provide any
particular details therein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent
that such failure to provide, delay in providing or omission of any particular
detail actually prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend
against such matter.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall respond to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) Business Days following the date that the Notice of Claim is
delivered to pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ (the " ** _Response Period_** "),
specifying whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim(s)
described in the Notice of Claim, describe in reasonable detail the basis for
each such dispute and include reasonable supporting materials (a " ** _Claim
Response_** "). If the Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response
within the Response Period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to
dispute the claim(s) described in the related Notice of Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party gives a Claim Response within the Response Period but does
not in such Claim Response dispute all of the claim(s) made in the related
Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to dispute the
undisputed claim(s) described in the related Notice of Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to dispute any claim described in a Notice of
Claim, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.6_, the amount of Losses
alleged in such Notice of Claim shall be conclusively deemed to be an
obligation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be paid
the amount specified in the Notice of Claim as provided in _Section 8.8_ (it
being acknowledged that the amount of any estimated Losses shall be revised by
the Indemnified Party from time to time as the same are determined, all of
which Losses shall be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party). If the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Response within the Response Period
indicating that the Indemnifying Party disputes one or more of the matters
identified in the Notice of Claim, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly meet in
good faith to resolve the dispute. If Purchaser and Seller do not resolve a
dispute regarding a claim within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Claim Response, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may
submit the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution. Upon
resolution of such dispute, whether by agreement or by a court of competent
jurisdiction, if it is determined that any indemnification payment is required
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ such amount shall be paid to the Indemnified
Party as provided in _Section 8.8_.

 



 

8.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any matter for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ that
relates to a Proceeding or Claim by a third party (a " ** _Third Party
Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party a
Notice of Claim relating to such Third Party Claim promptly after receiving
written notification of such Proceeding or Claim; _provided, however_ , that
any failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party
hereunder except to the extent that such failure to provide or delay in
providing actually prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend
against such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, upon delivery to the Indemnified Party,
within thirty (30) days after notice of the Third Party Claim has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party, of an acknowledgement and agreement that
(i) any Losses resulting therefrom are indemnifiable Losses for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_
(subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.6_) and (ii) that the
Indemnifying Party shall post any bond or other security

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent required in connection with the defense or appeal of such Third
Party Claim (an " ** _Assumption of Defense Notice_** "), _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall have an additional ninety (90) days after the
delivery of such notice to revoke such acknowledgement and agreement with
respect to any portion of such Losses based on matters that become known to
the Indemnifying Party during such period and which indicate that such Losses
would not be indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (and if a notice of such
revocation is not delivered by the Indemnifying Party during such ninety (90)
day period, such Losses shall conclusively be deemed indemnifiable Losses).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim
involves a purported class action, (ii) such Third Party Claim involves
criminal allegations, (iii) such Third Party Claim demands injunctive or other
equitable relief that, if granted, would have an adverse effect on any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or their respective businesses (if a Purchaser
Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party) or any of the Seller Indemnified
Parties or their respective businesses (if a Seller Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party), (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the
Losses associated with such Third Party Claim are likely to exceed the then-
remaining amount of the Indemnification Cap or (v) the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third Party Claim under applicable standards of legal ethics.

 



 

(c) Unless and until the Indemnified Party receives, with respect to any Third
Party Claim, an Assumption of Defense Notice from the Indemnifying Party
within the thirty (30)-day period provided above or if, at any time after the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party fails diligently to defend such Third Party Claim (i) the
Indemnified Party may, but shall not be obligated to, fully assume, commence
and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim in any such manner as it may
deem appropriate, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall thereafter promptly inform
the Indemnifying Party of all material developments related to such Third
Party Claim (including copying the Indemnifying Party on court filings and
correspondence); _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to turn over any attorney-client privileged information, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim, including the retention and (upon the Indemnified
Partys request) the provision to the Indemnified Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and (iv) the Indemnified Party shall not
settle any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, any attorneys fees and
expenses and other costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim prior to the time at which such Third
Party Claim has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party as provided herein or
during any subsequent time in which the Indemnified Party is conducting its
own defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 8.5_
shall be Losses hereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall control and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim and the cost of
such defense shall

 



      
 

 



 

constitute Losses of the Indemnified Party, with the indemnification by the
Indemnifying Party against all such Losses being subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 8.6_, to the extent applicable, but the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party. During any time period in which the
Indemnifying Party is defending a Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material developments
related to such Third Party Claim (including copying the Indemnified Party on
court filings and correspondence) and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim,
including the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (A) the compromise or settlement does not
involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, breach of
Contract by, or violation of Law by, the Indemnified Party, (B) the sole
relief provided in the compromise or settlement is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and does not include any requirement
that the Indemnified Party take or refrain from taking any actions other than
compliance with any non-disclosure obligations related to the terms of such
settlement contained in the settlement agreement, (C) the compromise or
settlement includes an unconditional and irrevocable release of the
Indemnified Party, (D) the settlement agreement includes a reasonable
confidentiality obligation by the Third Party claimant of the terms of the
settlement and (E) the Indemnified Party is a party to, or an express Third
Party beneficiary of, the settlement agreement, entitled to enforce such
settlement agreement. The Indemnified Party shall have no Liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claims made without
its consent (if such consent is required by this _Section 8.5_) and any such
compromise or settlement shall be void.

 



 

(e) This _Section 8.5_ shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be
governed by _Section 6.2(d)_.

 



 

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Purchaser Limitations_.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification
made pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ if the Losses associated with such claim
(or group of related claims arising out of the same or similar circumstances)
are less than Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) (the " ** _De Minimus Claim
Amount_** ").

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification
made pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate dollar
amount of all Losses of the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all claims relating to Losses that would
otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ exceeds One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " ** _Threshold Amount_** "), after which
point Seller shall be required to provide indemnification with respect to all
indemnifiable Losses with respect to any such claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ from dollar one. In addition, subject to
_Section 8.6(e)_, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(i)_, _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ or _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ to the
extent that all claims made under any or all of such Sections are in an
aggregate amount in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the " **
_Indemnification Cap_** ").

 



 

(b) _Seller Limitations_. Subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ (i) unless the Losses
associated with such claim (or group of related claims arising out of the same
or similar circumstances) exceed the De Minimus Claim Amount, (ii) unless and
until the Losses associated with all claims for indemnification made pursuant
to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties aggregate
at least the Threshold Amount, after which point Purchaser shall be required
to provide indemnification with respect to all indemnifiable Losses with
respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_
from dollar one or (iii) in an aggregate amount in excess of the
Indemnification Cap.

 



 

(c) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VIII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be entitled to receive indemnification under this _Article
VIII_ for any Losses relating to (i) any multiple of any direct Losses or (ii)
any special, exemplary or punitive damages; _provided, however,_ that this
limitation shall not apply if, and solely to the extent that, an Indemnified
Party is seeking to obtain through indemnification reimbursement of such
Losses resulting from an award in a Third Party Claim against such Indemnified
Party of such Losses.

 



 

(d) _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party
may have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of
more than one provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event,
condition or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
the amount of any Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
more than once, regardless of whether such Losses may be as a result of a
breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be able to recover
any Loss for which it is otherwise entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement if such Loss has already been taken into account in determining the
Closing Cash Consideration or in determining the Net Increase or Net Decrease,
as finally determined in accordance with _Section 1.5_.

 



 

(e) _Exceptions; Overall Indemnity Cap_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
provisions of _Sections 8.6(a)_ and _(b)_ shall not apply with respect to
any Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any action or
inaction that constitutes fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation, (ii) the De Minimus Claim Amount and the Threshold Amount
shall not apply

 



      
 

 



 

to any indemnification claims made with respect to the Fundamental
Representations and (iii) the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any
indemnification claims made with respect to the Fundamental Representations
and any such indemnification with respect to Fundamental Representations shall
be excluded in calculating when the Indemnification Cap is reached, and
instead the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which indemnification is
required to be made with respect to a Fundamental Representation by Seller
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_
shall be the Purchase Price.

 



 

8.7 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any
representation and warranty of Seller set forth in _Article II_ or _Article
III_ and (ii) the Losses for any such breach, all materiality qualifications
contained in such representations and warranties (however they may be phrased
and including the word "material", the term "Material Adverse Effect" and
words or terms of similar import) shall be ignored and not given any effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materiality qualifications shall not be ignored,
and they shall be given effect, for purposes of the definition of Permitted
Liens or Material Contracts and any use of such terms in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, in good faith, diligently
seek recovery, at its or their own expense, of all insurance proceeds from
insurers with respect to all Losses with respect to which any Purchaser
Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification under this _Article
VIII_; _provided that_ (i) the expenses incurred by Purchaser or the Company
in connection with such recovery and the net present value of any increase in
premiums of the applicable insurance policies relating to the claims so made
shall be a Loss related to such claim for indemnification and (ii) no
Indemnifying Party shall delay making any payment under this _Article VIII_
pending resolution of any such insurance claim. To the extent that Purchaser
or the Company receives any amount under insurance coverage with respect to a
matter for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has previously obtained payment
in indemnification under this _Article VIII_ from Seller, Purchaser shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such insurance proceeds, pay
and reimburse to Seller for any prior indemnification payment (up to the
amount of the insurance proceeds) by deliver of cash in such amount.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties made by the Company and Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser and Parent, on the other hand, in this Agreement are
made with the knowledge and expectation that Seller is (in the case of
representations and warranties made by Purchaser and Parent) and Purchaser is
(in the case of representations and warranties made by the Company and Seller)
placing reliance thereon in entering into, and performing its obligations
under, this Agreement.

 



 

8.8 _Source of Recovery; Payment of Amounts Due_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the application of _Section 8.6_, within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_ that any amount
is due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under _Section 8.3(a)_, such amount
shall be satisfied (i) if the amount of such payment is less than the
aggregate amount of the Deferred Cash Payment (as reduced by any

 



      
 

 



 

prior application of this _Section 8.8_ prior to the time of such payment),
then by a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Deferred Cash Payment to be made
pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_ and (ii) if the amount of such payment is equal
to or greater than the aggregate amount of the Deferred Cash Payment (as
reduced by any prior application of this _Section 8.8_ prior to the time of
such payment), then by a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the remainder of the
Deferred Cash Payment to be made pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_, with the
amount of any excess paid by Seller to Purchaser within such five (5)-Business
Day period, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For the avoidance
of doubt if there are any unresolved indemnification claims by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties outstanding on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser may defer until the resolution thereof the payment to Seller of that
portion of the Deferred Cash Payment equivalent to reduction that would occur
therein if all such unresolved indemnification claims were resolved in favor
of Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Subject to the application of _Section 8.6_, within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_ that any amount
is due to any Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, such amount shall be paid by
Purchaser to such Seller Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

(c) If any payment required under this _Section 8.8_ is not made in full
within five (5) Business Days after it is determined under this _Article
VIII_ that such payment is due, the unpaid payment shall thereafter bear
simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time
(as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus six (6) percentage points,
until paid in full.

 



 

8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedies of (a) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of
the Company and Seller contained in this Agreement or any non-fulfillment or
breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement and (b) the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any non-fulfillment or breach of any
of the covenants and agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, in
each case, whether based in contract or tort or any other theory of liability,
are the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the Parties set forth
in this _Article VIII_. The provisions of this _Section 8.9_ shall not,
however, prevent or limit the remedies (i) contemplated by _Section 1.5_,
(ii) contemplated by _Section 10.12_ with respect to specific performance or
injunctive relief for breaches of covenants, (iii) contemplated by _Section
6.2_ with respect to Taxes or (iv) for any claim based upon fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. For the avoidance of doubt, (A)
the limitation set forth in this _Section 8.9_ shall not apply to any of the
Transaction Documents other than this Agreement and (B) to the extent that any
matter is subject to indemnification under alternative provisions of this
Agreement, an Indemnified Party may seek such indemnification under such
alternative provisions of this Agreement, but such Indemnified Party may not
recover duplicate amounts for its Losses relating to such matter.

 



      
 

 



 

8.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price, unless otherwise required under applicable Law.

Seller set forth in this Agreement, in each case such that the conditions to

satisfied as of the time of such breach or inaccuracy; _provided, however,_
that if such breach or inaccuracy is curable by the Company or Seller through
the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts within twenty (20) days after
written notice thereof is delivered to the Seller, then Purchaser may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)_ prior to the end of such
twenty (20)-day period so long as the Company and Seller, as applicable,
continue to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach,
inaccuracy or non-fulfillment (and then only if such breach, inaccuracy or
non-fulfillment has not been cured);

 



 

(c) by Seller, (I) upon a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties of Purchaser set forth in _Article IV_, or upon
a breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement, in each case such that the condition to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or inaccuracy; _provided, however,_ that if such breach or inaccuracy
is curable by Purchaser through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof is delivered to
Purchaser, then Seller may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(c)_ prior to the end of such twenty (20)-day period so long as Purchaser
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach,
inaccuracy or non-fulfillment (and then only if such breach, inaccuracy or
non-fulfillment has not been cured) or (II) if the Marketing Period has been
completed and the conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and
_Sections 7.2(c)_ and _(d)_ are satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ that such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied) and Purchaser is unable
to satisfy its obligation to effect the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.4_ because of a failure to
have obtained the Financing;

 



 

(d) by either Purchaser or Seller, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before June 30, 2015 (or such other date to which Purchaser and Seller may
agree in writing) (the " ** _Termination Date_** "); _provided, however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall
not be available (i) to Purchaser at any time that there is a material breach
of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or Purchaser is in material breach or non-
fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, in each case such that the Sellers

at any time that there is a material breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of the Company or Seller contained in this
Agreement or the Company or Seller is in material breach or non-fulfillment of
any covenant or agreement of the Company or Seller set forth in this
Agreement, in each case such that Purchasers conditions to Closing under
_Section 7.1_ are not satisfied; or

 



 

(e) by either Seller or Purchaser, if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Order or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining
or otherwise prohibiting the Closing and such Order or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that (i) if Purchaser is the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_,
Purchaser shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Order
or other action and such Order or other action shall not have been principally
caused by the breach by Purchaser of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, and (ii) if Seller is the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_, Seller shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to remove such Order or other action, and such Order or
other action shall not have been principally caused by the breach by the
Company or Seller of the covenants or agreements of the Company and Seller
under this Agreement.

 



 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall give
written notice to the other of any termination by it of this Agreement
pursuant to _Sections 10.1(b)_, _(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ , which notice shall
identify the clause pursuant to which the termination is being effected. Upon
delivery of such notice or upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_, this Agreement will become null and void, and there will be
no liability on the part of any Party, any of their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, equityholders,
representatives, agents or advisors, except that:

 



 

(a) any such termination shall not affect the Parties respective rights and
obligations under _Section 5.9_ (publicity), this _Section 9.2_, _Article
X_ or the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall survive such
termination; and

 



 

(b) if such termination results from the fraud of the Company or Seller, the
willful or intentional failure of the Company or Seller to perform a covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement or the willful or intentional breach
by the Company or Seller of any of their respective representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Seller shall be fully
liable for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Purchaser as a result of
such fraud, failure or breach; and

 



 

(c) if such termination results from the fraud of Purchaser, the willful or
intentional failure of Purchaser to perform a covenant or agreement set forth
in this Agreement or the willful or intentional breach by Purchaser of any of
its respective representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall be fully liable for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
the Company and Seller as a result of such fraud, failure or breach.

10.3 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated (whether in
whole or part, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of Law, merger,
consolidation, dissolution or otherwise) by (a) Parent or Purchaser without
the prior written consent of Seller; or (b) Seller, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser or Parent shall
have the right without the consent of Seller to (i) assign its rights and

provided that such assigning party shall remain responsible for any failure of
the assignee to fulfill such obligations; _provided_ that Purchaser provides
notice of such assignment to Seller, (ii) assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to any successor to all or substantially all of the
business and assets of Purchaser or Parent; or (iii) collaterally assign its

Parent to have to obtain the consent of any Person to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the Consents set forth on
_Section 4.3_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule). Any purported assignment
or delegation of this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations
hereunder in violation of this _Section 10.3_ shall be void and of no force

hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

10.4 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing executed by Purchaser and Seller, which states that it
constitutes an amendment to this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that
are being amended. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by (a) Purchaser and Parent, by delivery to Seller of a written instrument
executed by Purchaser, which states that it constitutes a waiver of this
Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that are being waived and (b) Seller
and the Company (prior to the Closing), by delivery by Seller to Purchaser of
a written instrument executed by Seller, which states that it constitutes a
waiver of this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that are being waived.
Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth
in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time and at any
time) by a Party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for any period
of time) to exercise by a Party, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a
waiver of the right to exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the exercise of,
such right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time
and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a
Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of
such Party or shall, except to the extent so waived, impair, limit or restrict
the exercise of such right, power or remedy.

 



 

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the annex, exhibits and
schedules hereto, along with the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties, and
supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous Contracts (whether written or
oral), by or among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, including any letter of intent, term sheet or memorandum of terms
entered into or exchanged by the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates. The annex, exhibits and schedules specifically referred to herein,

be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be held to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction
under any circumstances for any reason (a) such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to be valid, enforceable
and

 



      
 

 



 

legal while preserving the intent of the Parties as expressed in, and the
benefits to such Parties provided by, such provision or (b) if such provision
cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and
an equitable adjustment shall be made to this Agreement (including addition of
necessary further provisions to this Agreement) so as to give effect to the
intent as so expressed and the benefits so provided to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. Such holding shall not affect or impair the
validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other
jurisdiction or under any other circumstances. Neither such holding nor such
reformation or severance shall affect or impair the legality, validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

10.7 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for purposes of
convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



 

10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

sign the same counterpart. Counterparts may be delivered by facsimile or other

(COLLECTIVELY, THE "DELAWARE COURTS"). EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS ASSETS, TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY OF THE DELAWARE COURTS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO
SERVICE

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT TO SERVE
PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR

SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY AGREES THAT ANY PROCEEDING (IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE)

(d) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR

OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS, (ii) SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii)
SUCH PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

10.11 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.9_, each of the Parties shall
have and retain all rights and remedies, at law or in equity, including rights
to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, arising out
of or relating to a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchasers
obligations to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate the Closing only in the event that each of the following conditions
has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Sections 7.2(c)_ and _7.2(d)_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), (ii) Purchaser fails to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and (iii) the Company has confirmed in a written
notice delivered to Purchaser that if specific performance is granted and the
Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.11(a)_, each of the
Parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that the non-breaching
Parties would be damaged irreparably and would have no adequate remedy of law
if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that
the other Parties shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance to
enforce the rights and obligations of the Parties from any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy of any
remedy at law.

 



 

10.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than Purchaser and Seller
has, is intended to have, or shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or
benefits under any provision of this Agreement, other than (a) any permitted
successors and assigns of the Parties under _Section 10.3_ (who are intended
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement) and (b) the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties (who are intended third party
beneficiaries of _Article VIII_).

 



 

10.13 _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement to annexes, exhibits,
schedules, articles, sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding annexes, exhibits, schedules, articles, sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless expressly provided
otherwise. Any capitalized term used but not defined in an annex or schedule
to this Agreement have the meaning set forth in this Agreement. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of
similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
article, section, subsection or other subdivision hereof unless expressly so
limited herein. The words "either," "or," "neither," "nor," and "any" are not
exclusive, and the word "or" is deemed to have the meaning "and/or". The word
"including" (in its various forms) means including without limitation. All
references to "$" and dollars shall be deemed to refer to United States
currency unless otherwise specifically provided. Pronouns in masculine,
feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other
gender, and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the
singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless
the context otherwise requires. Unless expressly stated to the contrary,
references in this Agreement or Annex A to any Contract are to that Contract
as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof. References in this Agreement to a Person shall include the
successors and assigns thereof. All references to materials in this Agreement,
including any report, record, file or other document, shall, in each case,
include any form or medium of such materials (including electronic form).

 



      
 

 



 

10.14 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party based on any
claim that such Party or counsel to such Party drafted this Agreement or any
provision hereof. The information contained in this Agreement and in the
schedules hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of Contract). Except for the limitation provided in _Section
2.11(d)_, each representation and warranty contained herein is independent of
all other representations and warranties contained herein (whether or not
covering an identical or a related subject matter) and must be independently
and separately complied with and satisfied. Exceptions or qualifications to
any representations or warranties contained in the text thereof or schedules
thereto shall not be construed as exceptions or qualifications to any other
representation or warranty, except that the Parties acknowledge and agree that
with respect to the Seller Disclosure Schedule, any exception to a
representation and warranty of Seller that is disclosed in a section thereof
under a caption referencing such representation and warranty shall be deemed
to also be an exception to each other representation and warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement for which a separate section is provided in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding the absence of a cross reference
thereto, if and to the extent that it would be reasonably apparent that such
exception is applicable to such other representation and warranty.

 



 

10.15 _Deliveries to Purchaser_. Any document or item shall be deemed
"provided" or "made available" by the Company to Purchaser for purposes of
_Article II_ and _Article III_ if such document or item is included prior to
the date of this Agreement in the electronic data rooms established by the
Company at https://bankstreet.firmex.com in connection with the transactions

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises and
covenants set forth herein and in the Stock Purchase Agreement and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Issue of Shares_. Investor hereby acquires from the Company in fulfillment of Section 1.3(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Company hereby issues to Investor in fulfillment of Section 1.3(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Shares. It is acknowledged that the value of the Shares was determined as of the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement, and such value was $12.28 per Share ($7,500,000 in the aggregate). On the date hereof, the Company shall record or cause to be recorded the name of Investor as the owner of the Shares in the records of the Company and shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Investor the Shares by electronic deposit of the Shares into an account designated by Investor prior to the date of this Agreement, or, if requested by Investor or if Investor has not identified such an account prior to the date of this Agreement, by delivery to Investor of a physical certificate for the Shares issued in the name of Investor.

 



 

2. _Company Representations_. The Company represents and warrants to Investor as of the date hereof as follows:

      
 

 



 

(a) _Organization and Corporate Power_. The Company is a corporation validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties
and to carry on its business as presently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, and to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Authorization and Enforceability_. All corporate action required to be
taken by the Companys board of directors in order to authorize the Company to
enter into this Agreement, and to issue the Shares has been taken. This
Agreement, when executed and delivered by the Company, shall constitute the
valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by any applicable
law of general application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights and relief of debtors
generally or (ii) as limited by general principles of equity, including
general principles of equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief
and other equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(c) _No Contravention_. The Company is not in violation or default of any
provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereunder do not (and shall
not with notice or lapse of time or both) conflict with, result in the breach
of, or constitute a default under (i) the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company, (ii) any order, injunction or judgment applicable to
the Company, (iii) any note, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or
other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the
Company is bound or to which the Company or any of the Companys assets are
subject or (iv) any statute, decree, rule or regulation of any court,
regulatory authority or governmental body applicable to the Company.

 



 

(d) _Consents_. Except as contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, no
consent or approval by any person is required to authorize, or is required in
connection with, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder by
the Company.

 



 

(e) _Valid Issuance of Securities; Capitalization_. The Shares will be, when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to, or issued in violation of, any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of law, the Companys certificate of incorporation, the
Companys bylaws or any contract or agreement to which the Company is a party
or otherwise bound. Assuming the accuracy of the representations of Investor
in _Section 3_, no registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " ** _Securities Act_** "), of the Shares is required for the issuance of
the Shares in the manner contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement. Except
as set forth in the SEC Documents (as defined below) and except for incentive
equity compensation of the Company pursuant to plans approved by the board of
directors of the Company, there is no capital stock of the Company issued and
outstanding or reserved for issuance, there are no securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock of
the Company and there are no outstanding obligations (including warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company) of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold (by
merger, consolidation or otherwise) any capital stock of the Company or any
securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of capital stock of the Company.

8-K being collectively referred to as the " ** _SEC Documents_** "). The
Company has not received any written comments from the SEC staff with respect
to the SEC Documents that have not been resolved to the satisfaction of the
SEC staff. As of their respective dates, the consolidated audited financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents, including the notes
thereto, complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the securities laws with respect thereto. Such
consolidated audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting procedures, consistently
applied, during the periods involved (except as may be otherwise indicated in
such financial statements or the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company as of the dates
thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows, as applicable, for
the periods then ended.

Agreement by Investor and the consummation by Investor of the transactions
contemplated hereunder do not (and shall not with notice or lapse of time or

breach of, or constitute a default under (i) the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of Investor, (ii) any order, injunction or judgment applicable to
Investor, (iii) any note, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or

 _Exhibit B_

 



 

 **FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Transition Services Agreement (this " **Agreement** ") is made and
entered into as of , 2015 (the " **Effective Date** "), by
and between MegaPath Corporation, a Virginia Corporation (" **MC** "), and
MegaPath Cloud Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
**CloudCo** "), on the other hand. MC and CloudCo are sometimes referred to
herein individually as a " **Party** " and collectively as the " **Parties**
".

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Global
Telecom and Technology Americas, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" **GTT** "), is
acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other
equity interests in MC pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated February 19, 2015, by and among GTT, MC, MegaPath Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and GTT Communications, Inc. (the " **Purchase
Agreement** "). Capitalized terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the
respective meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

B. As a condition to the consummation of the Closing under the Purchase
Agreement, MC has contributed to CloudCo certain assets and liabilities that
were directly related to MCs voice and cloud services business (the " **Cloud
Business** ") pursuant to a Contribution Agreement, dated ,
2015 by and between MC and CloudCo (the " **Contribution Agreement** "). In
connection with such contribution, MC has retained certain assets necessary
for CloudCo to operate the Cloud Business on a stand-alone basis and MC, in
anticipation of migrating certain systems and services to GTT, has transferred
to CloudCo certain assets necessary for MC to conduct is remaining business on
a stand-alone basis. Therefore, the Parties desire to provide transition
services to one another to afford an opportunity for CloudCo to procure, on a
stand-alone basis, the services to be provided by MC hereunder and for MC to
transition to GTT the services to be provided by CloudCo hereunder.
Accordingly, as a further condition to the consummation of the Closing under
the Purchase Agreement, this Agreement is being entered into by the Parties to
define and to establish all transition services to be provided by the Parties
following the Closing under the Purchase Agreement. This Agreement is being
entered into pursuant to Section 5.14 of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

1. **_Transition Services._**

 



 

a. _Joint Services by the Parties_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Party shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the
other Party those services set forth in the Joint Transition Service Schedules
(the " **Joint Transition Service Schedules** ") attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the " **Joint
Transition Services** "), for the period of time (unless otherwise terminated
prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

conclusion of such period in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) (the
" **Time Period** ") set forth in each Joint Transition Schedule.

 



 

b. _CloudCo to MC Transition Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, CloudCo shall provide, or cause to be provided, to MC and/or
its Affiliates those services set forth in the CloudCo Transition Service
Schedules (the " **CloudCo Transition Service Schedules** ") attached hereto
as _Exhibit B_ and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the "
**CloudCo Transition Services** "), for the Time Period set forth in each
CloudCo Transition Schedule.

 



 

c. _MC to CloudCo Transition Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, MC shall provide, or cause to be provided, to CloudCo and/or
its Affiliates those services set forth in the MC Transition Service Schedules
(the " **MC Transition Service Schedules** ") attached hereto in _Exhibit C_
and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the " **MC Transition
Services** " and, together with the CloudCo Transition Services and the Joint
Transition Services, the " **Transition Services** "), for the Time Period set
forth in each MC Transition Schedule.

 



 

d. _Identification of the Parties_. The Parties, in their respective
capacities as Transition Services providers (whether directly or indirectly)
under _Sections 1(a)_ , _1(b)_ , and _1(c)_ , as applicable, are referred to
herein from time to time as " **Provider** ", and in their (and on behalf of
their respective affiliates) respective capacities as recipients of
Transition Services under _Section 1(a), Section 1(b)_ and _Section 1(c)_,
as applicable, are referred to herein from time to time as " **Recipient** ".

 



 

e. _Cost for the Provision of the Transition Services_. For certain of the
Transition Services, there will be no charge between the Parties for the work
performed in connection with such Transition Services other than certain pre-
approved third party expenses that will be billed on a pass-through basis with
no mark-up and listed on the applicable Transition Service Schedules (the "
**No Charge Transition Services** "). For certain of the Transition Services,
the Recipient shall bear the cost for the provision of such Transition
Services (the " **Recipient Funded Transition Services** "), and the
applicable Transition Service Schedule shall set forth the cost and/or
methodology for calculating such cost. For certain of the other Transition
Services, Provider shall bear the cost for the provision of such Transition
Services (the " **Provider Funded Transition Services** "). For each
Transition Service, the applicable Transition Service Schedule shall state
whether such Transition Service is a No Charge Transition Service, a Recipient
Funded Transition Service or a Provider Funded Transition Service.

 



 

f. _Additional Transition Services_. A Party may at any time within one
hundred and twenty (120) days from the Effective Date request that the other
Party provide to it services in addition to those specified in the Transition
Service Schedules, so long as such additional services are related to the
purpose of the transition services described in Recital B. Any such request
shall be in writing and provided to the other Partys Primary Coordinator, as
that term is defined in _Section 3(a)_. To the extent requested by Recipient
and consented to by Provider, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, the appropriate Transition Service Schedule
shall be revised to include such additional services and the Time

 



      
 

 



 

Period, cost and other terms and conditions for the provision thereof. If the
Parties are unable to agree within ten (10) days after delivery of a request
for additional services to the Term, cost and other terms and conditions for
such additional service, such Dispute (as defined below) shall be resolved in
accordance with _Section 3_.

 



 

g. _Party Performing Transition Services_. As of the Effective Date, Provider
has disclosed to Recipient, and Recipient has approved, all third parties
known to Provider that are retained and will continue to be retained by
Provider or its Affiliates to provide, directly or indirectly, some or part of
the Transition Services to Recipient. Provider shall not, absent the prior
written consent of Recipient (such consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or as expressly provided for in _Section 2(c)_ or in
any Transition Service Schedule, subcontract, license, sublicense or otherwise
delegate or transfer any of the Transition Services to any other third party
or permit the use of any of the Transition Services by any Person other than
by Recipient, Provider and Affiliates of Provider. Provider shall not use any
third party to provide some or part of the Transition Services under this
Agreement unless such third party shall provide the services in accordance
with the requirements under each applicable Transition Service Schedule
(including cost) and comply with the performance standards under _Section
2(a)_.

 



 

2. **_Performance of the Transition Services_**.

 



 

a. _Performance Standard_. Except for a higher or different performance
standard that may be set forth in a Transition Service Schedule, Provider
shall perform, or cause to be performed, the Transition Services to be
provided by it to Recipient in accordance with the instructions, guidelines
and requirements set forth in the applicable Transition Service Schedule, in a
manner consistent with the practices in effect prior to the date of the
Contribution Agreement, to the extent applicable, and with at least the same
degree of skill, attention and care as if such Transition Service were being
provided to Providers business; _provided, however_ , that such skill,
attention and care shall at a minimum be timely, professional and in a
workmanlike manner and consistent with the level of care, skill, practice and
judgment exercised by other professionals in performing services of a similar
nature.

 



 

b. _Compliance with Laws_. Each Party shall comply with all applicable laws
with respect to its performance pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Party shall secure and maintain all governmental
approvals, licenses and permits reasonably necessary for the conduct by it and
its employees of the actions contemplated by this Agreement in compliance with
applicable law.

 



 

c. _Provider Responsibilities_. With respect to the Transition Services,
except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Transition Service Schedule
and in accordance with _Section 1(g)_, Provider shall have the right to
select, employ, retain, pay, supervise, administer, direct and discharge any
of its employees, consultants, subcontractors, or third party vendors or
agents who will perform such Transition Services; _provided, however_ ,
Provider shall assign necessary and sufficient resources and qualified
personnel as are reasonably necessary to provide the Transition Services in
accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2_ and the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Party shall be solely responsible
for payment of compensation to its employees. Each Party shall have full
responsibility for payment of all

 



      
 

 



 

federal, state and local taxes or contributions imposed under unemployment
insurance, social security and income tax laws with respect to its own
employees.

 



 

d. _Third Party Agreement for Services._ The Parties acknowledge and agree
that MC is a party to a Transition Services Agreement entered into as of
January 1, 2015 (" **GC TSA** ") with GC Pivotal, LLC (" **Global Capacity**
") and that some of the Transition Services provided for under this Agreement
will be provided by CloudCo to MC for the benefit of Global Capacity as part
of MCs obligations to Global Capacity under the GC TSA, and that CloudCo may
receive some of the Transition Services under this Agreement directly from
Global Capacity as part of Global Capacitys obligations to MC under the GC
TSA. This Agreement does not purport to restate all of the rights and
obligations under the GC TSA; however, the Parties agree and acknowledge that
it is implied that each of the Parties will perform certain services and
receive benefits under this Agreement which are related to the GC TSA. Neither
CloudCo nor MC will be relieved on any obligations under this Agreement by
virtue of the fact that Global Capacity is the indirect or direct recipient
of, or provider of, any of the Transition Services under this Agreement.

 



 

3. **_Governance_**.

 



 

a. _Executive Steering Committee_. Prior to the date hereof, each of CloudCo
and MC has designated at least one executive-level person to serve on an
Executive Steering Committee. Such Executive Steering Committee shall meet in
person or telephonically, no less than one time per month during the Term to
receive briefings from the Primary Coordinators as to the status and progress
of each Transition Service. Either Party may change its designated executive-
level designee upon giving the other Party notice to that effect in accordance
with _Section 15(b)_.

 



 

b. _Primary Coordinators_. Prior to the date hereof, each of CloudCo and MC
has designated a primary contact person, who is and shall be a managerial (or
higher) level employee, to oversee the implementation and completion of the
Transition Services (the " **Primary Coordinators** "). Either Party may
change its Primary Coordinator upon giving the other Party notice to that
effect in accordance with _Section 15(b)_. Each Primary Coordinator may
delegate his or her authority and responsibility hereunder with respect to any
individual Transition Service to an individual designated in the applicable
Transition Service Schedule (each, a " **Service Coordinator** "). Unless
CloudCo and MC otherwise agree, and except as set forth in a Transition
Service Schedule with respect to a particular Transition Service, all
communications relating to this Agreement and/or the Transition Services shall
be directed to the Primary Coordinators in accordance with this _Section 3_,
except that (i) any communication with respect to a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, (ii) any notice under _Section 3(e)_ or (iii) any
notice designating a new representative of a Party pursuant to this _Section
3_ shall be directed to the persons designated pursuant to _Section 15(b)_.
Each Primary Coordinator and each Service Coordinator shall devote such time
as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the responsibility of the position.

 



 

c. _Primary Coordinator Meetings_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Primary
Coordinators from time to time, the Parties agree that the Primary
Coordinators shall be required to meet in person or telephonically, no less
than once per week during the first three (3) months

 



      
 

 



 

of the Term (as defined below). During the remainder of the Term, the Primary
Coordinators shall be required to meet in person or telephonically, no less
frequently than every other week. At each scheduled meeting, the Primary
Coordinators shall review the progress on each Transition Service, including
actions to be taken to complete the transition of such service within the Time
Period set forth in the applicable Transition Service Schedule. The Primary
Coordinators will notify their respective Service Coordinators of each in-
person meeting or telephone conference call that they will need to attend.

 



 

d. _Disputes_. If a dispute arises between the Parties with respect to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or any Transition Services Schedule, or
any subject matter governed by this Agreement (excluding the following
disputes which are subject to _Section 13_: (i) disputes regarding the
default in the payment when due of any fees or expenses with respect to a
Transition Service or group of Transition Services and such default is not the
subject of a bona-fide good faith dispute, (ii) disputes regarding a Partys
compliance with the applicable confidentiality provisions, or (iii) suits to
compel compliance with this dispute resolution process or with the provisions
of this _Section 3_) (each, a " **Dispute** "), the Parties shall use and
follow the dispute resolution procedure set forth in _Section 3(e)_ (the "
**Dispute Resolution Process** ") before seeking judicial relief or initiating
arbitration pursuant to _Section 13_.

 



 

e. _Dispute Resolution Process._ A Dispute shall initially be submitted in
writing to the Primary Coordinators for resolution. The Primary Coordinators
shall promptly discuss and attempt to resolve any Dispute submitted to them in
good faith following such submission. If by the end of the fifth (5th)
business day following such submission, the matter has not been resolved to
the satisfaction of both Primary Coordinators, then the Party that initiated
the claim may provide written notification to their Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Executive Officer of the other Party, in the form of a claim
identifying the issue or amount disputed and including a reasonably detailed
reason for the claim. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Chief Executive
Officers shall promptly meet in person or by telephone and attempt to resolve
in good faith the Dispute within five (5) business days of receiving the
written request. If they can resolve the Dispute within that time period, such
resolution will be memorialized in writing. If they cannot resolve the Dispute
within that time period, either of the Parties may seek specific performance
or initiate arbitration in accordance with _Section 13_. The Parties may vary
the duration and form of these procedures by mutual written agreement.

 



 

4. **_Records_** **.**

 



 

a. _Records for Transition Services; Retention_. Provider shall keep and
maintain accurate and complete records and accounts regarding the provision,
directly or indirectly, of Transition Services by it, in a manner reasonably
consistent with the manner in which records and accounts regarding such
Transition Services were kept by MC prior to the date of the Contribution
Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
For each Transition Service, Provider shall retain such records for a period
of three (3) years following the end of the Term, or such longer period as may
be required by law.

 



 

b. _Records for Recipient Funded Transition Services; Audit_. During the Term
and for three (3) years thereafter, Recipient shall have the right, at its
expense, during normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice, to
audit and inspect Providers records and

 



      
 

 



 

accounts related to costs and expenses of Provider with respect to any
Recipient Funded Transition Services and to have access to Providers
employees having knowledge of such matters. For each Recipient Funded
Transition Service, no such audit may cover the same time period more than one
time. Recipient specifically agrees that all such books and records related to
the documentation of the Recipient Funded Transition Services shall be "
**Confidential Information** " (as that term is used in _Section 9_) and
shall be treated as provided under _Section 9_.

 



 

5. **_Intellectual Property._**

 



 

a. _Intellectual Property Approvals_. Each Party shall secure and maintain all
necessary intellectual property rights and approvals from third parties
reasonably necessary for the performance by such Party of its obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

b. _No Joint or Derivative Works_. All copyrights, patents, trade secrets,
trademarks or other intellectual property rights of a Party (in this capacity,
the " **Providing Party** ") to which the Providing Party provides access to
the other Party (in this capacity, the " **Receiving Party** ") in connection
with the performance of this Agreement shall be and shall remain the sole and
exclusive property of the Providing Party and nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to create, or represent the intent of the Providing Party to
authorize the creation of, any joint work with the Receiving Party or allow
any derivative work to be created by the Receiving Party, in each case based
on any intellectual property rights of the Providing Party, or otherwise to
confer upon the Receiving Party any right or interest of ownership in any such
intellectual property rights.

 



 

c. _No Grant of License_. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party is not
by this Agreement granting any right or license whatsoever, by implication,
estoppel, or otherwise, to such Party to utilize any information, know-how,
proprietary data, trademarks, copyrights or patent rights which such other
Party may have or may secure in the future.

 



 

6. **_Disaster Recovery; Backup_**. During the Term, while and to the extent any software, data, computer equipment, communications equipment and other similar items are used by Provider to provide Transition Services, Provider shall continue to have in place business continuity, disaster recovery services and backup and archival services pursuant to a disaster recovery and business continuity plan maintained by Provider, which plan shall be no less comprehensive and robust than the plan maintained by MC prior to the date of the Contribution Agreement. A copy of Providers plan shall be promptly provided to Recipient upon Recipients request.

 



 

7. **_Time Period, Term and Termination of the Services_**.

 



 

a. _Time Period; Term._ With respect to the Transition Services, each
Transition Service shall have the Time Period set forth in the applicable
Transition Service Schedule, unless otherwise extended in accordance with
_Section 7(b)_ or terminated early in accordance with _Section 7(c)_. This
Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration of the last Time Period
set forth in any Transition Services Schedule, unless otherwise earlier
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof (the " **Term** ").

 



      
 

 



 

b. _Extension of Time Period_. Recipient may at any time not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the scheduled termination date of a Transition Service, as
set forth in the applicable Transition Service Schedule, request in writing to
Provider to extend the Time Period for such Transition Service. To the extent
requested by Recipient and consented to by Provider, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Provider shall provide such
Transition Services during the extended Time Period (the " **Extended
Transition Services** ") on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (after taking into account any amendments or modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that are implemented in connection with
such extension), and for a such time period and at such cost as shall be
mutually agreed to in good faith by Provider and Recipient; _provided,
however_ , that any Extended Transition Services shall not be provided after
unless Provider has consented thereto, which consent may be given or withheld
in Providers sole and absolute discretion. To the extent that the termination
date for any Transition Service has been extended pursuant to this _Section
7(b)_, the Time Period for such Service shall be deemed to be extended
accordingly. If CloudCo and MC are unable to agree within ten (10) days of a
request on the terms and conditions of an extension of a Time Period, such
Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 3_.

 



 

c. _Early Termination of Transition Service_. Except as otherwise set forth on
the applicable Transition Service Schedule, at any time or from time to time
Recipient (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not Provider) may terminate any
individual Transition Service or group of Transition Services prior to the end
of the applicable Time Period(s) by providing thirty (30) days advance
written notice to Provider of Recipients intention to terminate such
Transition Service(s). All Transition Services shall end on the month-end of
such month of termination. Except as provided in the Transition Service
Schedules, Recipient shall be responsible for (i) the cost of such Transition
Service up to the date such Transition Service is terminated, and (ii) any and
all expenses Provider contracted for and were approved by Recipient prior to
the notice to terminate in anticipation of providing such Transition Service
until the expiration of the applicable Time Period for such Transition
Service, and for which Provider cannot cancel for less than the cost of such
expense. All such expenses shall be billed and paid in accordance with
_Section 8_.

 



 

d. _Cessation of Transition Service Obligation_. Recipient agrees and
acknowledges that all obligations of Provider to provide Transition Services
shall immediately cease upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Time
Period for such Transition Service, (ii) the early termination of such
Transition Service in accordance with _Section 7(c)_ or (c) any termination
of the Agreement as provided in _Section 7(e)_. Recipient shall bear sole
responsibility for instituting permanent services and/or obtaining replacement
services in respect of the Transition Services terminated in accordance with
the provisions hereof, and Provider shall have no liability for Recipients
failure to implement or to obtain such service or for any difficulties in
transitioning from the Transition Service to such permanent or replacement
service.

 



 

e. _Termination of the Agreement_. The Time Period for any Transition Service
may be accelerated with respect to any individual Transition Service or group
of Transition Services by mutual written consent of the Parties, and may be
terminated with respect to any individual Transition Service or group of
Transition Services by (i) Provider in the event that a

 



      
 

 



 

Bankruptcy Event occurs with respect to Recipient or Recipient Defaults in the
payment when due of any fees or expenses with respect to such individual
Transition Service or group of Transition Services and such Default (A) is not
the subject of a bona-fide good faith Dispute, and (B) continues uncured for a
period of thirty (30) days after such Recipients receipt of written notice of
such default or (ii) Recipient in the event that a Bankruptcy Event occurs
with respect to Provider or Provider materially breaches this Agreement and
such breach is not curable or, if curable, continues uncured for a period of
thirty (30) days after Providers receipt of written notice of such breach.
Any such termination shall be effective immediately upon delivery of a notice
of termination by the terminating Party to the other Party (subject to the
foregoing cure periods).

 



 

f. _Definition of Bankruptcy Event_. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
**Bankruptcy Event** " means, with respect to a Party, that: (i) such Party
commences a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its debts under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or
seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
similar official of such Party or any substantial part of its property, or
consents to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by
any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against
it, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or fails
generally to pay its debts as they become due, or take any corporate action to
authorize any of the foregoing; or (ii) an involuntary case or other
proceeding shall be commenced against such Party seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or
seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
similar official of such Party or any substantial part of its property, and
such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and
unstayed for a period of forty-five (45) days.

 



 

g. _Survival of Certain Provisions and Obligations_. Notwithstanding any
termination or expiration of this Agreement or any Transition Service under
this Agreement, _Sections 4_ , _5_ , _8_ , _9_ , _13_ , _14_ and _15_ and this
_Section 7(g)_ shall each survive termination or expiration of this
Agreement. The termination or expiration of this Agreement or any Transition
Service hereunder shall not affect: (i) any outstanding payment obligations of
any Party under this Agreement as of such termination or expiration; or (ii)
any liability of a Party relating to any default or breach of this Agreement
by such Party prior to such termination or expiration.

 



 

8. **_Consideration; Payment and Billing for the Transition Services_**.

 



 

a. _Payment_. As consideration for the Transition Services, Recipient shall
pay to Provider the amount specified for each such Transition Service as set
forth in the Transition Schedules in _Exhibits A_ , _B_ and _C_. Any out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Provider and included in any invoice under this
Agreement shall be fully documented and reflect the actual reasonable cost
incurred (without mark-up).

 



 

b. _Billing_. Provider will bill Recipient on no more than a monthly basis in
arrears for the provision of the Transition Services. Payment of any such
invoices by Recipient will be due and payable forty-five (45) days following
the date of receipt of such invoice by Recipient (except for Disputed Amounts,
which are addressed in _Section 8(c)_). Any payments

 



      
 

 



 

that are not paid within such forty-five (45) day period shall incur interest
at a rate of 1.0% percent per annum from the day following the day on which
payment was due and payable and ending on the day on which the amount is paid.
To the extent that Transition Services are provided to an Affiliate of a
Party, amounts owed attributable to such Transition Services shall be paid, or
caused to be paid, by such Party on behalf of its Affiliate receiving such
Transition Services. Recipient shall pay and reimburse Provider for any and
all taxes and government charges, including, without limitation, sales or use
charges, imposed on Provider so long as Provider has any obligation to collect
with respect to, in connection with or relating to its provision of the
Transition Services, other than income tax, gross receipts tax or similar
taxes imposed on revenue or income.

 



 

c. _Billing Disputes._ If the billed Party has a bona fide, good faith dispute
with any of the amounts on an invoice (" **Disputed Amounts** "), the billed
Party must pay all amounts not in dispute as set forth in this _Section 8_,
and provide the billing Party with a written request for a billing adjustment
together with a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis for such
adjustment within forty-five (45) days from the date of it received the
invoice on which the disputed amount first appeared. If the billing Party
denies, in good faith, the billed Partys dispute after reviewing the
supporting documentation the billed Party submits, either Party may seek
arbitration to resolve the dispute in accordance with the process described in
_Section 13_. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to dispute an invoice
within such forty-five (45) day period shall not limit Recipients rights to
subsequently challenge any invoice or constitute a waiver of Recipients
rights under this Agreement with respect to the Transition Services covered by
such invoice.

 



 

d. _Default_. If Recipient fails to pay the fees for a Transition Service
(other than fees related to Disputed Amounts) within forty-five (45) days
after it receives the invoice (a " **Default** "), Provider may send Recipient
a notice of such default and may, in its discretion and without further
notice, suspend or terminate such Transition Service if Recipient fails to
cure the non-payment within thirty (30) days after the notice of Default. In
that event, Provider shall be entitled to pursue any remedy to which it may be
entitled in law or in equity to recover the amount owing.

Information Disclosing Party that is provided to an Information Receiving
Party shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Information
Disclosing Party and no license in, or other rights with respect to, such
Confidential Information is or shall be deemed to have been granted by such
provision of Confidential Information (but subject to the provisions of the
last sentence of _Section 9(b)_).

 



 

d. _Required Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
9(b)_, the Information Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information
of the Information Disclosing Party if and to the extent required by any third
party subpoena or judicial order or decree or by applicable law, regulation or

such Confidential Information, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Information
Receiving Party provides advance notice of such requirement (other than
disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange Commission or stock
exchange rule) to the Information Disclosing Party so that the Information
Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 9_ and if, in
the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver
from the Information Disclosing Party, the Information Receiving Party is
legally required to disclose any Confidential Information of the Information
Disclosing Party, the Information Receiving Party: (i) reasonably cooperates
with the Information Disclosing Party to obtain, at the Information Disclosing
Partys expense, an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such Confidential

Receiving Party is legally required to disclose.

request from the Information Disclosing Party, either: (i) deliver to the
Information Disclosing Party or its representative all materials containing
Confidential Information of the Information Disclosing Party that were
received by the Information Receiving Party from the Information Disclosing
Party; or (ii) destroy all materials containing Confidential Information of

perjury, such destruction; _provided, however_ , that (A) the Information
Receiving Party may retain Confidential Information in accordance with (i) the
Information Receiving Partys document retention and disaster recovery
policies and procedures and (ii) applicable legal, governmental or regulatory
requirements, (B) the Information Receiving Party may retain one archival copy
of such materials for use by the Information Receiving Party solely in
connection with any disputes with the Information Disclosing Party concerning
this Agreement, and (C) this obligation shall not apply to any Confidential
Information referred to in the last sentence of _Section 9(b)_; and

Information Receiving Party shall not to remove any proprietary rights legend
from, and upon the Information Disclosing Partys reasonable request shall add
such legend to, materials disclosing or embodying Confidential Information.

 



 

f. _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this _Section 9_, and any breach of the
terms of this _Section 9_ would result in irreparable injury and damage for
which neither Party would have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the
event of a breach or a threatened breach of this _Section 9_, each Party, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at law or in
equity, shall be entitled to specific performance or immediate injunctive or
other equitable relief from a court in order to enforce, or prevent any
violations of, the provisions of this _Section 9_ (without posting a bond or
other security), without having to prove damages. The terms of this _Section
9_ shall not

 



      
 

 



 

prevent any Party from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



 

g. _Non-Exclusive Obligation_. The foregoing provisions of this _Section 9_
are in addition to, and in no way limit, any applicable rights or obligations
of the Parties under any other agreements by or among them.

 



 

10. **_Status of Parties; Adherence to Computer and other Policies_**.

 



 

a. _Relationship of the Parties_. None of the provisions of this Agreement is
intended to create nor will it be deemed or construed to create a partnership,
employment, agency, franchise or joint venture or other relationship between
the Parties other than that of independent entities contracting with each
other under this Agreement solely for the purpose of effecting the provisions
of this Agreement. Neither Party will be construed to be the employer of the
other. Provider and its agents shall act under this Agreement solely as an
independent contractor and not as an agent of Recipient. Provider shall not
incur any debts or make any commitments for Recipient, except to the extent,
if at all, specifically provided herein. Neither Provider nor any person
working for or with Provider will be eligible for any employee benefits from
Recipient (nor does Provider or any such person desire any such benefits) and
any entitlement to such benefits is expressly waived. Each Party shall be
solely responsible for the management, direction and control of its employees.
Neither Party shall have any right, power or authority, express or implied, to
enter into any agreements on behalf of the other Party, assume or create any
obligations or responsibilities, or make any representation or warranty,
express or implied, for or on behalf of the other Party, or bind the other
Party in any way.

 



 

b. _Computer and other Policies_. Each Party gaining access to the other
Partys employees, facilities or information technology systems (an "
**Accessing Party** ") shall cause all of its employees to adhere to all
reasonable and law abiding policies of the other Party that are communicated
to the Accessing Party pertaining to the other Partys employees, facility
and/or information technology systems.

 



 

11. **_Modification of Procedures_**.

 



 

a. _Right to Modify Procedures_. Subject to the procedure set forth herein and
to the extent applicable, Provider may make changes from time to time in its
standards and procedures for performing the Transition Services, provided that
the Transition Services provided with any such new standards or procedures
will be of a level that is comparable, or exceeds, those previously provided
and Provider provides written notice of such changes to Recipient.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, unless required by law, Provider shall
not implement any substantial changes affecting any Transition Services
provided to Recipient unless Provider gives Recipient written notice thereof
and thirty (30) days (i) to accept, and adapt its operations to accommodate,
such changes or (ii) to reject the proposed changes and terminate the
applicable Transition Services.

 



 

b. _Process for Modification_. During the Term, Recipient shall, within ten
(10) Business Days after such plans are available, provide Provider with a
plan identifying any changes in Recipients business that may affect the
provision of the Transition Services in order

 



      
 

 



 

for Provider to provide the Transition Services to Recipient; _provided,
however_ , that Provider shall not be required to alter the method in which it
provides the Transition Services or increase the level of such Transition
Service in any material manner except as expressly provided herein; and
_provided, further_ , that the failure of Recipient to provide such notice
shall not alter or diminish Providers obligation to provide the Transition
Services on the terms set forth herein.

 



 

12. **_Representations and Warranties_**. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that:

 



 

a. Such Party possesses, and shall continue to possess, the skill, expertise,
and knowledge to provide the Transition Services to be provided by it
hereunder, and further represents that it holds, or shall obtain at its sole
expense, all consents, licenses, permits, registrations or authorities
necessary to perform the Transition Services to be performed by it hereunder.

 



 

b. Such Party is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of the state of its organization, and has all
requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted in each jurisdiction where the failure to do
so would have a material adverse effect on its business, properties, or
ability to conduct the business currently conducted by it.

 



 

c. (i) Such Party has the requisite power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder, (ii) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by such Party of the
transactions contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by its board of
directors, (iii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such
Party, and (iv) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
against such Party, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its
terms, except as the enforceability of this Agreement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

 



 

d. No authorization, consent, or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is necessary on the part of such Party for the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

e. No action by or against such Party is pending or, to the best of such
Partys knowledge, threatened which could affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of this Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

13. **_Dispute Resolution_**.

 



 

a. _Specific Performance_. The Parties shall be entitled to seek specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary
damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief against any such breaches
or threatened breaches of the performance of Transition Services.

 



 

b. _Arbitration_. The Parties agree that, with the exception of seeking
specific performance in accordance with _Section 13(a)_ and the recovery of
unpaid fees as provided in

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8(d)_, binding arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
for resolution of disputes between the Parties. Such dispute shall be
submitted for arbitration in New York, New York, before a single arbitrator
agreed upon by the Parties, or, if they are unable to agree, a single
arbitrator appointed by American Arbitration Association (" **AAA** "). Such
arbitration shall be governed by the commercial rules of the AAA. The
arbitrators decision will be final and entered into any court of competent
jurisdiction. The prevailing party will be entitled to recover its attorneys
fees and costs in connection with such arbitration.

 



 

14. **_Indemnification; Limitation of Liability_**.

 



 

a. Subject to _Section 14(b)_, each Party shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party, each of its Affiliates
and each of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, managers,
members, stockholders, agents and representatives from and against, any and
all damages, fines, penalties, deficiencies, losses, liabilities (including
settlements and judgments), demands, claims, actions or causes of action,
assessments, taxes (including excise and penalty taxes), penalties and
expenses (including, without limitation, interest, court costs, reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts and
professionals or other reasonable fees and expenses of investigation,
litigation or other proceedings) (collectively, " ** _Losses_** ") incurred by
such indemnified Person resulting from, arising out of or relating to any (i)
breach of any of the representations and warranties of the indemnifying Party
set forth in _Section 12_ or of any covenant or agreement of the indemnifying
Party set forth in this Agreement; (ii) violation of applicable law or willful
misconduct by, or grossly negligent act of, any such indemnifying Party, any
of its Affiliates or any of its and their respective employees, officers,
directors, managers, members, stockholders, agents or representatives in
connection with performance, directly or indirectly, of such indemnifying
Party of any Transition Services to be provided by such indemnifying Party
under this Agreement; (iii) any material misrepresentation or omission made to
a third party by such indemnifying Party, any of its Affiliates or any of its
and their respective employees, officers, directors, managers, members,
stockholders, agents or representatives regarding the Transition Services that
was not authorized by the other Party in writing or (iv) use of any materials
supplied by, or receipt of any services from, the indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Agreement constituting or resulting in an infringement of any patent,
copyright or trademark of any third party or resulting in any misappropriation
of any trade secret of such third party.

 



 

b. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE IN CONTRACT, TORT, FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR
OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
ARISING FROM ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH PARTY, OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM THE
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF A PARTY OR ITS EMPLOYEES. FOR THE
AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS _Section 14(b)_ SHALL NOT APPLY
TO SUCH DAMAGES THAT A PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY TO A THIRD PARTY IN RESOLUTION
OF ANY CLAIM BY SUCH THIRD PARTY AGAINST SUCH PARTY.

 



      
 

 



 

c. The indemnified Party agrees to promptly notify the indemnifying Party in
writing of any written claims or demands against the indemnified Party for
which the indemnified Party seeks indemnification from the indemnifying party
under this _Section 14_ ( _provided, however_ , that any failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent
that such failure to provide or delay in providing actually prejudices the
ability of the indemnifying Party to defend against such matter) and the
indemnifying Party will have the opportunity to direct the defense of any such
claims that relate solely to monetary damages. The indemnified Party will
cooperate with the indemnifying Party in connection therewith; _provided_ that
the indemnified Party will be entitled to participate therein through counsel
of its own choice and at its own expense. The indemnifying Party shall not
settle any such claim or action without the prior written consent of the
indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The indemnifying Party agrees to accept liability for the
indemnified Partys defense or settlement of any such claims or demands if the
indemnifying Party either does not have the right to assume the defense of
such claim or demand hereunder or, if it has such right, fails to timely
assume the defense of such claim or demand after being notified of such claim
or demand.

 



 

15. **_Miscellaneous Provisions_**.

 



 

a. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement
or any of the Transition Service Schedules, each Party shall bear all costs

Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

b. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required
or permitted to be given in this Agreement shall be provided pursuant to
Section 10.2 of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

c. _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated (whether in
whole or part, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of Law, merger,
consolidation, dissolution or otherwise) by (i) MC without the prior written
consent of CloudCo; or (ii) CloudCo, without the prior written consent of MC.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall have the right without the
consent of any other Party to assign its rights and delegate its obligations
hereunder to any successor to all or substantially all of the business and
assets of such Party; _provided_ that the rights and obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and that an assignment or
delegation of this Agreement by a Party or of any of a Partys obligations
under this agreement shall not operate to release such Party from any of its
obligations under this Agreement or from the specific obligation assigned or
delegated by such Party. Any purported assignment or delegation of this
Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations hereunder in violation of
this _Section 15(c)_ shall be void and of no force or effect. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

d. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing executed by each of the Parties, which states that it
constitutes an amendment to this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that
are being amended. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by (i) MC, by delivery to CloudCo of a written instrument executed by MC,
which states that it constitutes a waiver of this Agreement and specifies the
provision(s) that are being waived and (ii) CloudCo, by delivery by CloudCo to
MC of a written instrument executed by CloudCo, which states that it
constitutes a waiver of this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that are
being waived. Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from
time to time and at any time) by a Party of, nor the delay or failure (at any
time or for any period of time) to exercise by a Party, any right, power or
remedy shall constitute a waiver of the right to exercise, or impair, limit or
restrict the exercise of, such right, power or remedy or any other right,
power or remedy at any time and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any
right, power or remedy of a Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other
right, power or remedy of such Party or shall, except to the extent so waived,
impair, limit or restrict the exercise of such right, power or remedy.

 



 

e. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the schedules hereto, along
with the Purchase Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties,
and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings
and negotiations (whether written or oral), by or among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. The schedules specifically referred to
herein are an integral part of this Agreement.

 



 

f. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be held to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction
under any circumstances for any reason (i) such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to be valid, enforceable
and legal while preserving the intent of the Parties as expressed in, and the
benefits to such Parties provided by, such provision or (ii) if such provision
cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and
an equitable adjustment shall be made to this Agreement (including addition of
necessary further provisions to this Agreement) so as to give effect to the
intent as so expressed and the benefits so provided to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. Such holding shall not affect or impair the
validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other
jurisdiction or under any other circumstances. Neither such holding nor such
reformation or severance shall affect or impair the legality, validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

g. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for purposes of
convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



 

h. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which (when executed and delivered) shall be considered one and the
same Agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterpart
signature pages have been signed by each Party and delivered by each Party to
the other Parties, it being understood that the Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Counterparts may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic

 



      
 

 



 

transmission method (including pdf), and any counterpart so delivered shall be
deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for
all purposes.

 



 

i. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, ALL
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ALL DISPUTES AND PROCEEDINGS
(IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE
FOREGOING SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ENFORCED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION
OF LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 



 

j. _Remedies_. Each of the Parties shall have and retain all rights and
remedies, at law or in equity, including rights to specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief, arising out of or relating to a breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and
that the non-breaching Parties would be damaged irreparably and would have no
adequate remedy of law if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each
Party agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to a decree of specific
performance to enforce the rights and obligations of the Parties from any
court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith, without the necessity of
posting a bond or other security or proving actual damages and without regard
to the adequacy of any remedy at law.

 



 

k. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than MP or CloudCo has, is
intended to have, or shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits
under any provision of this Agreement, other than any permitted successors and
assigns of the Parties under _Section 15(c)_ (who are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement).

 



 

l. _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement to schedules, sections,
subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding schedules,
sections, subsections and other subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless
expressly provided otherwise. Schedules to this Agreement are attached hereto
and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes. Any capitalized
term used but not defined in an annex or schedule to this Agreement have the
meaning set forth in this Agreement. The words "this Agreement," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import, refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular article, section, subsection or
other subdivision hereof unless expressly so limited herein. The words
"either," "or," "neither," "nor," and "any" are not exclusive, and the word
"or" is deemed to have the meaning "and/or". The word "including" (in its
various forms) means including without limitation. All references to "$" and
dollars shall be deemed to refer to United States currency unless otherwise
specifically provided. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall
be construed to state and include any other gender, and words, terms and
titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise
requires. References in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to a Person shall include the successors and assigns thereof. All
references to materials in this Agreement, including any report, record, file
or other document, shall, in each case, include any form or medium of such
materials (including electronic form).

 



 

m. _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Party based on any claim
that such Party or counsel to such Party drafted this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

 



 

n. _Force Majeure_. Any delay in or failure of performance by a Party, other
than payment of money, shall not constitute default hereunder if, and solely
to the extent, such delay or failure of performance is caused by occurrences
or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of such Party, including: "acts
of God", acts of a public enemy, acts of terrorism, acts of a nation or any
state, territory, province or other political division thereof, fires, floods,
riots, quarantine restrictions or any other causes, whether or not of the same
class or kind as those specifically named above, in each case which are not
within the reasonably control of such Party and which in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, such Party would be unable to prevent (each, a " **Force
Majeure Event** "). The Party whose performance is affected by a Force Majeure
Event shall: (i) provide prompt (under the circumstances) notice to the other
Party of the occurrence of such Force Majeure Event, including its good faith
estimate of the time required to rectify such Force Majeure Event and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of such Force Majeure
Event upon performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and upon the
receipt of such notice, the Parties shall promptly confer, in good faith, to
agree upon equitable, reasonable action to minimize the impact, on both
Parties, of such conditions.

 



 

o. _Conflicts in Provisions_. If there is any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms and conditions set forth in the main body of this Agreement
and the Transition Service Schedules, the provisions of the main body of this
Agreement shall control. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control solely with respect to the rights
and obligations of the parties regarding the Transition Services.

In consideration of the foregoing recitals and the respective covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties contained herein, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE 1

 

 _CONTRIBUTION_

 



 

1.1 _Contributed Assets_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Transferors hereby contribute, transfer and assign to Transferee,
effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the date of this Agreement (the " _Effective

the Effective Time, all of the following assets and rights of Transferors
(collectively, the " _Contributed Assets_ "):

  (1) The date of this Agreement will be one day prior to the Closing Date (as

Contributed Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Transferor hereby disclaims any warranty (express or implied) of
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose as to any portion of the
Contributed Assets. Accordingly, Transferee accepts the Contributed Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "WITH ALL FAULTS."

 



 

ARTICLE 2

 

SUPPORT OF TRANSFER

 



 

2.1 _Non-Assignable Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if any contract intended to be included in the assets to be
contributed to Transferee under this Agreement is not assignable without the
consent, approval or waiver by a third party, either as a result of the
provisions thereof or applicable law, and such consent, approval or waiver has
not been obtained on or prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Non-Assignable
Contract_ "), this Agreement and any related instruments of transfer shall not
constitute an assignment or transfer of such Non-Assignable Contract (and such
Non-Assignable Contract shall not be included in the Contributed Assets and
the obligations under such Non-Assignable Contract shall not be Assumed
Liabilities) unless and until the such required consent, approval or waiver is
received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Transferee shall and, to the extent
requested by Transferee, the applicable Transferor will use its commercially
reasonable efforts (at Transferees expense) for a period of at least six (6)
months following the Effective Date to

  (2) To be completed prior to the Allocation Date (as such term is defined in
the Purchase Agreement) as contemplated by Section 5.13 of the Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

(3) To be completed prior to the Allocation Date (as such term is defined in
the Purchase Agreement) as contemplated by Section 5.13 of the Purchase
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

obtain all such consents, approvals or waivers and Transferee will cooperate
with such efforts. Pending the receipt of any required consent, approval or
waivers, such Non-Assignable Contracts shall be treated as a Shared Contract
under Section 5.14 of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

2.2 _Updating of Schedules_.

 



 

(a) No later than 120 days after the Effective Time, MC shall deliver to
Transferee (i) one or more new schedules under _Section 1.1_ updating the
information thereon to accurately reflect the assets actually transferred by
Transferors to Transferee at the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The new schedules described in _Section 2.3(a)_ shall be final and
binding on the Parties unless Transferee delivers to MC a written notice of
disagreement with such schedules within 60 days following the receipt thereof.
Such written notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in
reasonable detail, identifying the specific items (whether included in, or
omitted from, such schedules) as to which Transferee disagrees and shall be
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation. During such 60 day period,
each of the Parties shall provide each of the other Parties and their
respective advisors with on-site access during regular business hours and upon
reasonable notice to all relevant books and records and employees of such
Party to the extent necessary to review the matters and information used to
prepare such schedules, all in a manner not unreasonably interfering with the
business of such Party. If Transferee delivers a notice of disagreement in a
timely manner, then Transferee and MC shall attempt to resolve all such
matters identified in such notice. If Transferee and MC are unable to resolve
all such disagreements within 30 days after the receipt by MC of the notice of
disagreement (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties), then
either MC or Transferee may submit the remaining disputed matters to the
Delaware Courts for resolution.

 



 

2.3 _Further Assurances_. Each Party will execute, acknowledge and deliver
such documents and instruments reasonably requested by any other Party, and
will take any other action consistent with the terms of this Agreement that
may reasonably be requested by any other Party, in each case at the expense of
the requesting Party, for the purpose of giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon the request of Transferee at any time, Transferors shall
execute a separate assignment agreement evidencing the assignment of any
intellectual property assets for recording in the United States Patent and
Trademark office or with any other governmental entity.

 



 

ARTICLE 3

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

3.1 _Indemnification_. Each Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each other Party from and against, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each
other Party in respect of, any and all Losses (as such term is defined in the
Purchase Agreement) incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid,
directly or indirectly, by such other Party arising out of, resulting from or
relating to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made
by the indemnifying Party in this Agreement or any non-fulfillment or breach
of any covenant or agreement made by or to be performed by such indemnifying
Party set forth in this Agreement.

in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time and at any
time) by a Party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for any period
of time) to exercise by a Party, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a
waiver of the right to exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the exercise of,
such right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time
and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a
Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of

the exercise of such right, power or remedy.

to herein, and delivered pursuant hereto, are an integral part of this
Agreement.

be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be held to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction
under any circumstances for any reason (a) such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to be valid, enforceable
and

 



      
 

 



 

legal while preserving the intent of the Parties as expressed in, and the
benefits to the Parties provided by, such provision or (b) if such provision
cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and
an equitable adjustment shall be made to this Agreement (including addition of
necessary further provisions to this Agreement) so as to give effect to the
intent as so expressed and the benefits so provided to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law. Such holding shall not affect or impair the
validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other
jurisdiction or under any other circumstances. Neither such holding nor such
reformation or severance shall affect or impair the legality, validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

4.7 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for purposes of
convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

counterparts, all of which (when executed and delivered) shall be considered
one and the same Agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterpart signature pages have been signed by each Party and delivered by

and effective for all purposes.

 



 

4.9 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, ALL
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ALL DISPUTES AND PROCEEDINGS
(IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE
FOREGOING SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ENFORCED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION
OF LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 



 

4.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL
PROCEEDINGS (IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ANY DISPUTES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE
FOREGOING SHALL BE COMMENCED AND PROSECUTED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL AND
STATE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND ANY APPELLATE COURT THEREFROM
(COLLECTIVELY, THE "DELAWARE COURTS"). EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS ASSETS, TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY OF THE DELAWARE COURTS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN _SECTION 4.2_.
NOTHING

 



      
 

 



 

IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT TO
SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, ANY
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ANY DISPUTES WITH RESPECT TO
ANY OF THE FOREGOING IN ANY OF THE DELAWARE COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY OF THE

PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii)

remedies, at law or in equity, including rights to specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief, arising out of or relating to a breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and
that the non-breaching Parties would be damaged irreparably and would have no
adequate remedy of law if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each
Party agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to a decree of specific
performance to enforce the rights and obligations of the Parties from any
court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in

 



      
 

 



 

connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy of any
remedy at law.

shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision
of this Agreement, other than any permitted successors and assigns of the
Parties under _Section 4.3_ (who are intended third party beneficiaries of
this Agreement).

 



 

4.13 _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement to schedules and
sections refer to the corresponding schedules and sections of or to this
Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular article, section,
subsection or other subdivision hereof unless expressly so limited herein. The
words "either," "or," "neither," "nor," and "any" are not exclusive, and the
word "or" is deemed to have the meaning "and/or". The word "including" (in its
various forms) means including without limitation. Pronouns in masculine,
feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other
gender, and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the
singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless
the context otherwise requires.

 



 

4.14 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Party based on any claim
that such Party or counsel to such Party drafted this Agreement or any
provision hereof.
