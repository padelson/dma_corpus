Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to (a) take such actions to reorganize their respective

reasonably (collectively, the "Pre-Arrangement Reorganization") and (b)
cooperate with Parent and its advisors in order to determine the nature of the
Pre-Arrangement Reorganization that might be undertaken and the manner in
which it might most effectively be undertaken; provided that the Pre-
Arrangement Reorganization (i) does not interfere with the ongoing operations
of Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) is not prejudicial to Company or any
Subsidiary of Company or Shareholders or inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement; (iii) shall not, and any actions taken in furtherance thereof
shall not be considered to, constitute a breach of the representations or
warranties or covenants of Company hereunder; (iv) does not require the
directors, officers, employees or agents of Company or its Subsidiaries to
take any action in any capacity other than as a director, officer or employee;
(v) does not impede, or interfere with, delay the occurrence of the Effective

third party. Parent shall provide written notice to Company of any proposed
Pre-Arrangement Reorganization at least 5 business days prior to the Effective
Time provided that the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization shall in no event be
effective prior to the granting of the Final Order. Company shall advance all
costs of the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization, including any liability for Taxes
of Company or any of the Subsidiaries that may arise as a result of such Pre-
Arrangement Reorganization, and Parent shall reimburse such costs prior to the
Effective Time such that, for the avoidance of doubt, all of such reimbursed
costs shall be not be deducted for the purpose of calculating Net Cash and/or
Working Capital. The parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to structure the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization in such a manner that it is
made effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the

Financing

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Parent represents and covenants to Company that it has sufficient funds
available to it to pay the Consideration on the Effective Date. Parent
covenants to maintain such funds available to it until the Effective Time and
to utilize such funds to pay the Consideration, unless this Agreement is
terminated as herein provided. To the extent that Parent and its financing
sources have not executed binding definitive documentation covering the Debt
Financing on the date hereof, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to enter
into such definitive documentation as promptly as practicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, a mere commitment letter shall not be deemed to be
definitive documentation for purposes hereof. The sole remedy for Parent\'s
breach of this Section 6.3(a) shall be payment of the Reverse Termination Fee,
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2(a).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Company shall cooperate with Parent in a reasonably timely manner and will
provide such information as shall be reasonably requested by Parent as
required by its financing documents to be entered into on or about the date
hereof (the "Debt Financing") and as expressly set forth in Schedule 6.3.
Company shall not unreasonably withhold further co-operation should additional
information be required by Parent\'s lenders.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Company acknowledges and agrees that under no circumstances shall it have any
recourse to any lender connected to the Debt Financing under this Agreement or
any other instrument.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

Parent shall not assert as a defense(or counterclaim) to any claim brought by
(or against) Company the refusal or failure of its lender to provide the Debt
Financing.

  |  

Net Cash and Working Capital Statements

(a)

  |  

On the second Business Day after the date of the Final Order, Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement, in the form attached as Schedule
6.4, setting out Working Capital, as of the end of the month preceding the
date on which the Final Order is issued, and Net Cash, computed on a fully-
reconciled basis or "book balance," as of the close of business on the
Business Day on which the Final Order is issued; provided that if the Final
Order is issued in the first 15 days of a calendar month, such statement shall
set out the Working Capital as of the end of the month prior to the preceding
month. Such statement shall be determinative of whether a Net Cash
Termination Event or a Working Capital Termination Event has occurred, absent
manifest error.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The parties shall in good faith reasonably cooperate so that Parent is kept
apprised of Company\'s financial position. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, for the period commencing on the date of first distribution of
the Company Circular to the Shareholders and ending on the Effective Date,
Company shall prepare and promptly deliver to Parent (i) weekly statements of
cash computed from Company cash in account or "bank balance" (to be delivered
within 2 Business Days after the last day of the relevant week), (ii) monthly
statements of Working Capital ( to be delivered within 25 days after the end
of the relevant fiscal month); provided however that Company shall notify
Parent on a weekly basis if it reasonably believes that Working Capital will
deviate by more than 10% from the most recently provided statement of Working
Capital; (iii) monthly unaudited consolidated balance sheet computed on a
fully-reconciled basis or "book balance" (and, to the extent prepared by
Company, income statement) of Company and its Subsidiaries for each fiscal
month of Company (to be delivered within 25 days of the end of each fiscal
month); and (iv) such other financial information as Parent shall reasonably
request.

7 prior thereto, and (ii) the board of directors of Company has determined by
formal resolution, in good faith and after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to result in,
if consummated in accordance with its terms, a Superior Proposal, but only to
the extent that the board of directors of Company also has determined by
formal resolution, in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties.

   
---|--- 
  

  

The board of directors of Company shall not, except in compliance with
Sections 7.5 and 7.6, approve, recommend, accept, support or enter into any
other agreement, arrangement or understanding in respect of any such
Acquisition Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by
Section 7.4.

  

     

7.3

  |  

Notification of Acquisition Proposal

   
---|--- 
  

  

Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt by
Company) notify Parent, at first orally and then promptly thereafter in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof and any
inquiry that Company reasonably expects to lead to any Alternative
Transaction, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
any Alternative Transaction or for access to the properties, books, or records
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that Company reasonably
believes is proposing to make, or has made, any Alternative Transaction. Such
notices shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of
any proposal and the identity of the person making such proposal or inquiry.
Company shall thereafter provide such other details of the proposal or
inquiry, discussions or negotiations as Parent may reasonably request and
shall attach copies of all letters, agreements and other documentation
(whether executed or in draft) exchanged by or on behalf of Company and the
party making the Acquisition Proposal in respect of such Alternative
Transaction. Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed by way of further
notices of the status including any change to the material terms of any such
Alternative Transaction.

  

    

7.4

  |  

Access to Information

   
---|--- 
  

  

If Company receives a request for information from a person that has made a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that complies with Section 7.2(b),
then, and only in such case, the board of directors of Company may, subject
to, only if such person is not already party to a confidentiality agreement in
favour of Company, the execution by such person of a confidentiality agreement
containing a standstill provision (which, for greater certainty, shall in no
event prevent or restrict such person, Company, its Subsidiaries or its or
their Representatives, or the board of directors of Company from engaging in
any activities otherwise permissible under Section 7.2(b)), with terms that
are no less favourable to Company in any material respect to the terms
applicable to Company in the Confidentiality Agreement and a prohibition on
such person\'s use of any information regarding Company or its Subsidiaries
for any reason whatsoever other than as relates to such person\'s evaluation
and consummation of the transaction that is the subject of the Acquisition
Proposal, provide such person with access to information regarding Company and
its Subsidiaries; provided for greater certainty that the substance of all
confidential discussions between Company and Parent or Buyer must remain
confidential; and further provided that Company sends a copy of any such
confidentiality agreement to Parent promptly upon its execution and Company
provides Parent (to the extent it has not already done so) with copies of the
information provided to such person and promptly provides Parent with access
to all information to which such person was provided access.

  

    

7.5

  |  

Implementation of Superior Proposal

   
---|--- 
  

  

Subject to Parent\'s rights under Section 7.6, Company may recommend, or
propose to publicly recommend, the approval or adoption (and thereby change
its recommendation regarding the Transactions) of a Superior Proposal, or
resolve or agree to take any such action (each a "Change of Recommendation")
in respect of which there has been no breach of Article 7 only if:

  

    

(a)

  |  

Company has complied with its obligations under this Article 7 with respect to
the Superior Proposal, including by providing Parent with all documentation
required to be delivered under Section 7.3 and a copy of the Superior Proposal
(including any draft agreement proposed to be entered into by Company which
governs the Superior Proposal and the financial value that the board of
directors of Company has, in consultation with its financial advisors,
determined in its good faith judgment should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under the Superior Proposal);

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

such Change of Recommendation is made following the period expiring at 5:00
p.m. (Toronto time) on the fifth business day (the "Response Period") after
the later of (i) the date on which Parent received written notice from the
board of directors of Company that it intends, subject only to compliance with
this Section 7.5, to effect a Change of Recommendation, and (ii) the date
Parent received a copy of the Superior Proposal as provided in Section 7.5(a);

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

the board of directors of Company has considered any amendment to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent (or on its behalf) before the end
of the Response Period as contemplated in Section 7.6 and determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal (as assessed
against this Agreement, together with the written amendments, if any, proposed
by Parent before the end of the Response Period) and that it would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties not to effect a Change of
Recommendation; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

the Special Meeting has not occurred.

   
---|--- 
  

  

If the Response Period would not terminate before the Special Meeting, Company
shall adjourn the Special Meeting to a date specified by Parent that is no
less than 2 and no more than 10 business days after the Response Period.

  

     

7.6

  |  

Response by Parent

   
---|--- 
  

  

During the Response Period, Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement. The
board of directors of Company shall review any such written offer by Parent to
amend this Agreement in good faith, in consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal to which Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when
assessed against this Agreement, as would be amended in accordance with the
written amendments, if any, proposed by Parent before the end of the Response
Period. If the board of directors of Company does not so determine by formal
resolution, it shall enter into an amended agreement with Parent and Buyer
reflecting Parent\'s proposed written amendments. If the board of directors
of Company does so determine then, Company may effect a Change of
Recommendation; provided that in no event shall the board of directors of
Company take any action that may obligate Company or any other person to seek
to interfere with the completion of the Transactions, or impose any "break-
up," "hello" or other fees or options or rights to acquire assets or
securities, or any other obligations that would survive completion of the
Transactions, on Company or any of its Subsidiaries, property or assets.

  

     

7.7

  |  

General

   
---|--- 
  

  

Nothing in this Article 7 (except as contemplated in Section 7.5) shall limit
the obligation of Company to convene and hold the Special Meeting to consider
the Arrangement as contemplated in Section 2.1. Each successive amendment to
any material terms of an Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of Section 7.5 and 7.6 and Parent shall
be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such Acquisition
Proposal.

  

ARTICLE 8 - TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT

  

    

8.1

  |  

Termination

   
---|--- 
  

  

Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.1, the rights and obligations
of the parties pursuant to this Agreement may be terminated at any time before
the Effective Time:

  

    

(a)

  |  

by mutual agreement in writing executed by Company and Parent (for itself and
on behalf of Buyer) (for greater certainty, without further action on the part
of Shareholders if termination occurs after the holding of the Special
Meeting);

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

by Company,

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

after the Outside Date, if the conditions provided in Section 3.1 or Section
3.2 have not been satisfied or waived by Company on or before the Outside
Date, provided however that the right to terminate pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to Company if its failure to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement or if its breach of any of its
representations and warranties under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such Outside Date;
or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

if there shall be enacted or made any applicable Law that makes consummation
of the Arrangement illegal or otherwise prohibited or enjoins Company, Buyer
or Parent from consummating the Arrangement and such applicable Law or
enjoinment shall have become final and non-appealable; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

at any time following the Special Meeting, if Shareholders do not cast (or do
not cause to be cast) sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to permit
completion of the Arrangement (provided Company has paid the Termination Fee
to Parent if there has been a Change of Recommendation); or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

by Parent,

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

after the Outside Date, if the conditions provided in Section 3.1 or Section
3.3 have not been satisfied or waived by Parent on or before the Outside
Date, provided however that the right to terminate pursuant to this Section
8.1(c)(i) shall not be available to Parent if its or Buyer\'s failure to
fulfill any of its or Buyer\'s obligations under this Agreement or if its or
Buyer\'s breach of any of its or Buyer\'s representations and warranties under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur by such Outside Date; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

if there shall be enacted or made any applicable Law that makes consummation
of the Arrangement illegal or otherwise prohibits or enjoins Company, Parent
or Buyer from consummating the Arrangement and such applicable Law or
enjoinment shall have become final and non-appealable; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

at any time if the board of directors of Company, or Company, as applicable,

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(A)

  |  

does not recommend in the Company Circular, or refuses to affirm (following
the public announcement of any bona fide Acquisition Proposal within the later
of (i) 5 days after a written request from Parent, and (ii) 1 day following
the expiry of any applicable Response Periods) its recommendation, that
Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(B)

  |  

does not recommend against (following the public announcement of any bona fide
Acquisition Proposal within the later of (i) 5 days after a written request
from Parent, and (ii) 1 day following the expiry of any applicable Response
Periods) the Shareholders voting in favour of an Alternative Transaction, or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(C)

  |  

effects a Change of Recommendation but excluding the resolution referred to in
Section 7.2(b); or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(D)

  |  

breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or agreements set forth in
Article 7 (other than those covenants and agreements set forth in Sections 7.3
and 7.4), or materially breaches or fails to perform in all material respects
any of the covenants or agreements set forth in Sections 7.3 and 7.4; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

it being acknowledged and agreed that a recommendation that Shareholders vote
in favour of the Arrangement or against an Acquisition Proposal, in either
case, made by the board of directors of Company after the date hereof (other
than in the Company Circular) other than on a unanimous basis shall not
constitute a failure to recommend or to reaffirm the recommendation of the
board of directors of Company;

  

    

(iv)

  |  

at any time if the Special Meeting is cancelled, adjourned or delayed except
as expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement or agreed to by
Parent in writing or requested by Parent; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(v)

  |  

at any time following the Special Meeting, if Shareholders do not cast (or do
not cause to be cast) sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to permit
completion of the Arrangement; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(vi)

  |  

at any time if Company shall have (A) breached any of its representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement (without giving effect to, applying to,
or taking into consideration any materiality qualification contained in such
representations and warranties), which breach, individually or in the
aggregate, is, or would reasonably be expected to be, Materially Adverse; or
(B) failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which failure, individually or in the aggregate, (1) is, or would
reasonably be expected to be, Materially Adverse, or (2) prevents, or impairs,
or would reasonably be expected to prevent or impair the ability of Parent or
Buyer to consummate the Transactions; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(vii)

  |  

there is a Working Capital Termination Event and/or Net Cash Termination
Event.

   
---|--- 
  

  

Neither Company nor Parent may seek to rely upon the failure to satisfy any
conditions precedent in Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3 or exercise any termination
right arising therefrom or any termination right provided in Section
8.1(c)(vi), unless forthwith and in any event prior to the filing of the
articles of arrangement for acceptance by the Director, Company or Parent, as
the case may be, has delivered a written notice to the other specifying in
reasonable detail all breaches of and failures to perform covenants,
representations and warranties or other matters which Company or Parent, as
the case may be, is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment of the
applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as
the case may be. If any such notice is delivered, provided that Company or
Parent, as the case may be, is proceeding diligently to cure all such matters,
if and for so long as all such matters are susceptible of being cured (for
greater certainty, except by way of disclosure in the case of representations
and warranties) ("Curable Matters"), the other may not terminate this
Agreement as a result thereof until the earlier of (i) the date that any
Curable Matter is no longer susceptible of being cured, (ii) the date that
Company or Parent, as the case may be, is no longer proceeding diligently to
cure all Curable Matters, and (iii) the later of (A) the Outside Date and (B)
the expiration of a period of 15 days from such notice (the "Termination
Period"). If such notice has been delivered prior to the date of the Special
Meeting, such meeting shall, unless the parties agree otherwise, be postponed
or adjourned until the earlier of (1) the date that is 2 business days after
the date that Company or Parent, as the case may be, notifies the other that
all Curable Matters have been cured, and (2) the expiry of the Termination
Period unless this Agreement is terminated on such date. If such notice has
been delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order or
the filing of the articles of arrangement for acceptance by the Director, such
application and such filing shall be postponed until the earlier of (x) the
date that is 2 business days after the date that Company or Parent, as the
case may be, notifies the other that all Curable Matters have been cured, and
(y) the expiry of the Termination Period unless this Agreement is terminated
on such date. For greater certainty, if all Curable Matters are cured within
the Termination Period without being Materially Adverse, this Agreement may
not be terminated as a result of the Curable Matter having been cured.

  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this Section
8.1 , this Agreement shall forthwith have no further force or effect and there
shall be no obligation on the part of Parent, Buyer or Company hereunder
except as set forth in Section 2.2(b), the last sentence of Section 5.6(a),
the last sentence of Section 5.10 , this Article 8, Article 9, Section 10.3
and Article 11, which provisions shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; provided further that, subject to Section 9.3, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.1 shall not relieve any party
from any liability for any material breach by it of this Agreement. A
termination of this Agreement shall not constitute a termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

  

     

8.2

  |

---|---

Agreement or waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of the

approvals of the Court and Shareholders in respect of any amendments to this
Agreement, including the Plan of Arrangement, to the extent required by
applicable Law.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE 9 - TERMINATION PAYMENTS

  

    

9.1

  |  

Payment to Parent

   
---|--- 
  

  

Provided that neither Parent nor Buyer is in breach of or has failed to

and the Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement at the Special Meeting,

shall immediately pay (or cause to be paid) the Termination Fee to Parent in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (I) Section 8.1(c)(v) in the
circumstances where there has been no Change of Recommendation, or (II)
Section 8.1(c)(vi)(B)(2); and (i) prior to the time of the Special Meeting, an
Alternative Transaction has been publicly announced and has not been withdrawn
prior to the Special Meeting, and (ii) at any time within the 12 months after
the date of such termination, Company approves, recommends, accepts, or enters
into any agreement, undertaking or arrangement in respect of, or Company or
its Shareholders consummate, an Acquisition Proposal, then Company shall
immediately pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Termination Fee, or, if
Parent Expenses have previously been paid pursuant to Section 9.1(d), an
additional cash amount equal to the difference between the Termination Fee and
the Parent Expenses in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

If Parent exercises its right of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(vi);
or Section 8.1(c)(vii); then Company shall immediately pay (or cause to be
paid) to Parent, in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, Parent\'s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (excluding
any financial advisor fees that were agreed to be contingent upon a successful
completion of the Transactions) incurred in connection with this Agreement up
to a maximum of $3 million (such amount so paid, the "Parent Expenses").

   
---|--- 
  

  

For greater certainty, and except as set forth in subparagraph (c) of this
Section 9.1, in no circumstance shall Company be obligated to make a payment
under more than one of subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section
9.1.

  

     

9.2

  |  

Payment to Company

   
---|--- 
  

  

Provided that Company is not in breach of or has failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, where such breach or failure would render Company incapable of
consummating the Transactions.

  


 

  

    

(a)

  |  

If Parent shall be unable to pay on the Effective Date in full the aggregate
Consideration for any reason other than the failure of any condition set out
on Schedule B or Schedule D to be satisfied, Parent shall immediately
thereafter pay (or cause to be paid) the Reverse Termination Fee to Company in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Company.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

If (i) Company is unable to obtain any applicable HSR Approval or (ii) Parent
breaches the covenants set forth in Section 10.7(a) with respect to any

incurred in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum of $3 million (such
amount so paid, the "Company Expenses"); provided, however that the right to
receive the Company Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.2(b) shall not be
available to Company if its failure to fulfill any of its obligations under
this Agreement, including Sections 5.2 and 10.7, has been the cause of, or
resulted in the failure of Parent being unable to obtain any applicable HSR
Approval in the case of clause (i) above or required Novation Agreement or
Other FAR 42.12 Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above.

   
---|---

9.3

  |  

Damages

   
---|--- 
  

  

The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Termination Fee or
other amounts set forth in Section 9.1, or the Reverse Termination Fee or
other amounts set forth in Section 9.2, as the case may be, are payments of
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which
Parent and Buyer, or Company, would suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement
and are not a penalty. The parties further acknowledge and agree, however,
that, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
in connection with any termination of this Agreement where a Termination Fee
or other amount set forth in Section 9.1, or the Reverse Termination Fee or
other amounts set forth in Section 9.2, is not paid or payable, Company,
Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to any additional remedies set forth in
this Agreement, including injunctive relief and specific performance, and all
additional and other remedies available at law or in equity to which Company,
Parent or Buyer, as applicable, may be entitled. Company, Parent and Buyer
each irrevocably waive any rights they may have to raise a defence that any
amounts that are required to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 9.1, or to
Company pursuant to Section 9.2, are excessive or punitive. Parent and Buyer,
and Company, as the case may be, agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
and other amounts set forth in Section 9.1, or the Reverse Termination Fee or
other amounts set forth in Section 9.2, are the sole and exclusive remedies of
Parent and Buyer, or Company, as the case may be, in respect of the events
giving rise to the payment of such amounts; provided that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply in the event of fraud or willful breach of this
Agreement by a party. Notwithstanding any provision set forth in this
Agreement to the contrary, including the provisions of this Section 9.3, the
provisions of Section 9.2(a) shall provide Company\'s sole and exclusive
remedy for the circumstances contemplated in Section 9.2(a).

10.1

  |  

Indemnities

   
---|--- 
  

  

From and after the Effective Time, and subject to Section 10.2, Company shall,
and Buyer shall cause Company to indemnify and hold harmless and provide
advancement of expenses to, and honour all exculpation rights of, all present
and past directors and officers of any member of Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Persons") pursuant to all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now
existing in favour of any Indemnified Person as provided in the articles of
incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizing documents of any member of
Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification contract or policy between
such Indemnified Person and any member of Company and its Subsidiaries
existing on the date hereof. Such rights shall survive the Effective Time and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

  

    

10.2

  |  

Directors and Officers Insurance and Other Indemnification Matters

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Directors and Officers Insurance Coverage. Prior to the Effective Time,
Company shall secure directors\' and officers\' liability tail insurance
coverage effective at the Effective Time from a reputable and financially
sound insurance carrier and containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous as a whole to the directors and officers of Company and its
Subsidiaries or Company and its Subsidiaries itself than those contained in
Company\'s policy in effect on the date hereof for the current and former
directors and officers of each member of Company and its Subsidiaries and
Company and its Subsidiaries on a 6 year "trailing" (or "run-off") basis with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Company shall not obtain policies
providing such coverage except to the extent such coverage can be provided at
an annual cost of no greater than 200% of the most recent annual premium paid
by Company prior to the date hereof (the "Premium Cap"); and provided,
further, that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained
only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Premium Cap, Company shall
only obtain coverage limits as can be obtained by paying an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap, beginning with the primary coverage of the type
currently in place. Company may expend more than the Premium Cap only with
the written consent of Parent.

   
---|--- 
  

  

If any member of Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) amalgamate, consolidate with or merge or wind-
up into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Company set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2.

  

    

(b)

  |  

Director and Officer Indemnification. Parent shall cause, for a period of at
least 6 years from the Effective Date, the organizing documents of Company as
of the Effective Date to contain provisions no less favourable with respect to
exculpation and indemnification of directors, officers, and employees from and
against liabilities arising prior to the Effective Date than are set forth in
the organizing documents of Company as of the Effective Date, except as
required by applicable Law.

10.3

  |  

Third Party Beneficiaries

   
---|--- 
  

  

This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other person
any rights or remedies hereunder, except as required under applicable Law, or
as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Sections 4.4,
9.3, 10.1, 10.2, 11.14, this Section 10.3, the last sentence of Section
2.2(b), and the first sentence of Section 5.9 (which provisions shall for

ordinarily resident in the United States terms and conditions of employment
that are comparable in the aggregate (including with respect to base pay and
Employee Benefit Plans, and including equity-based or other incentive
compensation plans for executive employees in appropriately comparable
subsidiary positions of Parent) to such terms and conditions of employment
that Parent provides, in the aggregate, as of the date hereof to similarly
situated Parent employees (including awarding service credit to each
Continuing Company Employee for his or her past service with Company for
purposes of eligibility and vesting only in each such Employee Benefit Plan of
Parent, but not benefit accrual, for any of Parent\'s Employee Benefit Plans;
provided, however, that in no event shall such credit result in the
duplication of benefits. With regard to severance, however, notwithstanding
the foregoing expression of intent, Parent currently intends that each
Continuing Employee\'s service with Company shall be counted for determining
the amount of severance from Parent.)

Continuing Company Employees ordinarily resident in the United States under
the terms and conditions of such Parent plans and benefits then in effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing expression of intent, for purposes of providing
group health plan coverage, (A) Parent shall provide the Continuing Employees
with health plan coverage identical or comparable to that provided to
Parent\'s employees, and (B) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, all
pre-existing conditions or eligibility waiting periods for each Continuing
Company Employee (and for the spouse and dependents of each such Continuing
Company Employee) covered by Parent\'s group health plan. Parent also
currently intends to allow Continuing Company Employees to participate
immediately in its 401(k) plan, under the terms of such plan, giving credit
for vesting and eligibility for service with Company or its Subsidiaries.

of the date hereof, to Company employees (including awarding service credit to
each Continuing Company Employee for his or her past service with Company for
purposes of eligibility and vesting only, but not benefit accrual, for any of
Parent\'s employee benefit plans; provided, however, that in no event shall
such credit result in the duplication of benefits).

With respect to severance, however, notwithstanding the foregoing expression
of intent, Parent currently intends that each Continuing Employee\'s service
with Company shall be counted for determining the amount of severance from
Parent.

Nothing in this Section 10.6 or any other provision of this Agreement shall
(i) create or confer any right of continued employment for any person, (ii) be

to amend, modify or terminate without notice any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iv) limit or restrict any right which employees

(b)

  |

required and in the event that any and all Novation Agreements or Other FAR
42.12 Agreements of any Assigned Contract, or any right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, shall not have been obtained within 90 days
after the Effective Date, then this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law,
shall constitute full and equitable assignment by Company to Buyer of all of
right, title and interest of Company in and to, and all liabilities of Company
under, such Assigned Contracts, and Buyer shall be deemed Company\'s agent for
purpose of completing, fulfilling and discharging all liabilities of Company
under any such Assigned Contract. The parties shall take all necessary steps
and actions to provide Buyer with the benefits of such Assigned Contracts, and
to relieve Company of the performance and other obligations thereunder,
including entry into subcontracts for the performance thereof. Parent and
Buyer agree to pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify Company against and
hold Company harmless from, all liabilities of Company relating to such
performance or failure to perform under such Assigned Contracts provided that
Buyer receives the rights and benefits thereunder.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

In the event that Company shall be unable to make the equitable assignment
described in Section 10.7(b), or if such attempted assignment would give rise
to any right of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the rights of
Company or Buyer under any such Assigned Contract, or would not assign all of
the rights of Company thereunder, Company and Buyer shall continue to
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with all such
rights.

with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or

preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto hereby agree

entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or

relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement in the event that
this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided
for in this Section 11.9 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(b) nothing set forth in this Section 11.9 shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any party\'s right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.9 prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Section 8.1 (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal
proceeding restrict or limit any party\'s right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.1 or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

not have exercised Dissent Rights,

   
---|--- 
  

  

but in no case shall Company, Parent, Buyer, the Depositary or any other

SCHEDULE D - SHARE DEPOSIT AND PAYMENT

  

  

4.1 Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate or
certificates (as applicable) which, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented outstanding Common Shares or Holdco Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(d), together with a duly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments
as the Depositary may reasonably require, each Shareholder represented by such
surrendered certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, after the Effective Time, the
consideration which such holder has the right to receive under this Plan of
Arrangement for such Common Shares or Holdco Shares, less any amounts withheld
as provided under the Arrangement Agreement, and any certificate(s) so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

  

  

4.2 From and after the Effective Time, each certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Common Shares or Holdco Shares shall be
deemed to represent only the right to receive the consideration in respect of
such Common Shares or Holdco Shares required under this Plan of Arrangement,
less any amounts withheld as provided under the Arrangement Agreement. Any
such certificate formerly representing Common Shares or Holdco Shares not duly
surrendered on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall
cease to represent a claim by, or interests of, any former holder of Common
Shares or Holdco Shares of any kind or nature against, or in, Company, Parent,
Buyer or Holdco. On such date, all cash to which such former holder was
entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to Buyer.

  

  

4.3 No former Shareholder shall be entitled to receive any consideration with
respect to such Common Shares or Holdco Shares other than the consideration to
which such former holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section
2.2(c) or 2.2(d) and, for greater certainty, no such Shareholder will be
entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in
connection therewith.

  

  

4.4 Lost Certificates. In the event any certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Common Shares or
Holdco Shares that were transferred pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(d) shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Depositary will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the consideration to which the holder is entitled pursuant to
this Plan of Arrangement. When authorizing such delivery in exchange for any
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to whom such consideration
is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such
consideration, give a bond satisfactory to Buyer (acting reasonably) in such
sum as Buyer, acting, reasonably, against any claim that may be made against
Buyer with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  

  

4.5 Withholding Rights. Company, Buyer, Parent and the Depositary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, price or consideration
otherwise payable to any Shareholder, such amounts as Company, Buyer, Parent,
Holdco or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under the ITA (or corresponding provincial legislation), United
States tax laws or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated
for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the securities in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such
withheld or deducted amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
Agency by or on behalf of Company, Buyer, Parent, Holdco or the Depositary, as
the case may be.

---|---
