<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.01. <U>Effect on Capital Stock</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) each share of Parent Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at
the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury
Stock) shall become and be converted into the right to receive 1.241 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;3.01(b) and Section
8.01(i), the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) of Parent Common Stock (the &#147;Stock
Consideration&#148;) or, at the election of a holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.02(a), 1.055 shares of Parent Common Stock (subject
to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;3.01(b) and Section&nbsp;8.01(i), the
&#147;Stock/Cash Exchange Ratio&#148;) and $6.12 in cash, without interest (the
&#147;Stock/Cash Consideration&#148;). The Stock Consideration and the Stock/Cash
Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the
&#147;Merger Consideration.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Exchange Ratio and the Stock/Cash Exchange Ratio shall be subject
to appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities through reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other like changes in Parent&#146;s capitalization (a &#147;Capital Change&#148;).
In addition, if Parent enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of
Parent Common Stock would be converted, prior to the Effective Time, into
shares or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper
provision shall be made in such agreement so that each Company shareholder
shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time such number of shares or
other securities or amount of obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred
immediately prior to the consummation of such conversion.

materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock (the

an unaffiliated bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">and Parent shall mutually agree (the &#147;Election Form&#148;), shall be mailed no
later than 15&nbsp;days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the &#147;Mailing Date&#148;) to each
holder of record of Company Common Stock as of a date which is no more than ten
days prior to the Mailing Date (the &#147;Election Form&nbsp;Record Date&#148;). Each
Election Form shall permit each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of
the Election Form&nbsp;Record Date (or in the case of nominee record holders, the
beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) to elect to
receive the Stock/Cash Consideration for all or some of such holder&#146;s shares (a
&#147;Stock/Cash Election&#148;) and shall provide that in the absence of such an
election by a holder all of such holder&#146;s shares of Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the Stock Consideration. Holders of record of shares of
Company Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacities (a &#147;Representative&#148;) may submit multiple Election
Forms, provided that such Representative certifies that each such Election Form
covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by that Representative for a
particular beneficial owner.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
calendar day following but not including the Mailing Date (or such other time
and date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (the &#147;Election
Deadline&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If a holder of Company
Common Stock either (i)&nbsp;does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a
timely fashion or (ii)&nbsp;revokes the holder&#146;s Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be
converted into the Stock Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Parent shall cause the Certificates described in clause (ii)&nbsp;of the
immediately preceding sentence to be promptly returned without charge to the
Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from
the Person who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election
Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters
shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall
be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, (i)&nbsp;Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and deliver to the Exchange Agent
certificates evidencing such number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
and (ii)&nbsp;Parent shall deliver, or cause Parent Bank to deliver, to the Exchange
Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable
pursuant to this Article&nbsp;III in exchange for Certificates representing
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such certificates for shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, and any such cash are hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Exchange Fund&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by
it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and provided that the
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered
such Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.01 of this
Agreement (which in all such cases shall be comprised of the Stock
Consideration). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of the Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i)&nbsp;a certificate representing
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such former holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii)&nbsp;a check representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former
holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and/or (iii)&nbsp;a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock which such former holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;3.03(b), each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Sections&nbsp;3.01
and 3.02 and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in
paragraph (c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;3.03. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
cash constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable
to holders of Certificates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section&nbsp;3.03. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section&nbsp;3.03, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders
the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange as provided in this Section&nbsp;3.03, or, in default thereof, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an
amount as may be required in each case by Parent. If any certificates
evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance

of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the shares of Company Stock which were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration
provided under this Article&nbsp;III. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and any
payment of cash as provided herein.

shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time (as well as
any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange

with Section&nbsp;3.03(b) shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of
Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed
prior to the date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency,
the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and
any other applicable law, become the property of Parent (and to the extent not
in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of
stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall
be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby
in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with
respect to any claims thereto.

to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Parent is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent.

provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip for

holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of the
Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the closing
price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Effective Date (as reported in <I>The Wall Street
Journal, </I>or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded

whether or not exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company
Option, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option
Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that
from and after the Effective Time, (i)&nbsp;Parent and the Human Resources and
Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors shall be substituted for the
Company and the committee of the Company Board (including, if applicable, the
entire Company Board) administering such Company Stock Option Plan, (ii)&nbsp;each
Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent
Common Stock, (iii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest
share, and (iv)&nbsp;the per share exercise price under each such Company Option
shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such
Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall
be rounded to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding clauses (iii)&nbsp;and (iv)&nbsp;of the
preceding sentence, each Company Option which is an &#147;incentive stock option&#148;
shall be adjusted as required by Section&nbsp;424 of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code.
Accordingly, with respect to any Company Option which is an incentive stock
option, fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares and where necessary the per share exercise price shall be rounded up to
the nearest cent. Parent and the Company agree to take all necessary steps to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.05.

expected to be a Lien, under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f)
of ERISA or Tax under Section&nbsp;4971 of the Code imposed against any
Company Benefit Plan. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any
single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an &#147;accumulated
funding deficiency&#148; (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section
412 of the Code or Section&nbsp;302 of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of the

the meaning of Section&nbsp;4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined
on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the Company
Pension Plan&#146;s most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then
current value of the assets of such Company Pension Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition of such Company
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

employees who have a significant role in Parent&#146;s internal controls, and Parent

other documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the

Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and

in no event shall Parent be required to continue any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the
Company for which there is no corresponding Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall

Sections&nbsp;7.02(a) or 7.03(a) hereof, respectively, or the compliance by the
Company and Parent with their respective covenants and agreements contained
herein.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.15 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of

construed as concurrence of the Company or its management with any such
adjustments.

Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a
risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock into shares of Parent Common Stock and Company Options
into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.15. Assuming that

Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock

Company Insider and expected to be converted into options
to purchase Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that
the requirement for a description of any Company Options shall be deemed to be
satisfied if copies of all Company Stock Plans, and forms of agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Company Options have been
granted have been made available to Parent. &#147;Company Insiders&#148; shall mean

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of June&nbsp;20, 2004, by and
between <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, a shareholder (&#147;Shareholder&#148;) of
BostonFed Bancorp, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, and Banknorth
Group, Inc. (&#147;Parent&#148;), a Maine corporation. All terms used herein and not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement
(defined below).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent and the Company are simultaneously entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended
from time to time pursuant to its terms, the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), pursuant to
which the Company will merge with and into Parent on the terms and conditions
set forth therein (the &#147;Merger&#148;) and, in connection therewith, each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.241
shares of Parent Common Stock or, at election of a holder of Company Common
Stock, 1.055 shares of Parent Common Stock and $6.12 in cash, without interest,
plus in each case cash in lieu of any fractional share interest; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Company Common Stock identified on
Annex I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock
subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being
referred to as the &#147;Shares&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder&#146;s capacity as a shareholder of the
Company and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform
this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <U>Agreement to Vote Shares</U>. Shareholder agrees
that at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or in connection
with any written consent of the shareholders of the Company at which a
proposal of the type set forth in clause (ii)&nbsp;below is presented for
consideration by the shareholders of the Company, Shareholder shall:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be
counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the
Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially
owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or
indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (x)&nbsp;in favor of
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (y)&nbsp;against
any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in
this Agreement; and (z)&nbsp;against any Acquisition Proposal or any other
action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be
expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with,


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect
consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <U>No Transfers</U>. After the date hereof and
prior to the special meeting of the Company shareholders held to consider
and vote upon approval of the Merger Agreement, Shareholder agrees not
to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise
dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares if such sale,
transfer, pledge, assignment or disposition could occur prior to such
meeting, except the following transfers shall be permitted: (i)&nbsp;transfers
by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the
transferee, subject to applicable law, (ii)&nbsp;transfers pursuant to any
pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement, (iii)&nbsp;transfers in connection with estate
and tax planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and
charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iv)&nbsp;transfers to any other
shareholder of the Company who has executed a copy of this Agreement on
the date hereof with respect to some or all of the Shares held by such
shareholder, (v)&nbsp;transfers or dispositions to the Company for the
surrender or delivery of Shares for the payment of the exercise price of
outstanding stock options, the payment or withholding of applicable taxes
in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or any other
surrender or deemed surrender of Shares in connection with the exercise
of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
and (vi)&nbsp;such transfers as Parent may otherwise permit in its sole
discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section&nbsp;2 shall be null and void.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <U>Representations and Warranties of
Shareholder</U>. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees
with Parent as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;A. <U>Capacity</U>. Shareholder has all requisite
capacity and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;B. <U>Binding Agreement</U>. This Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors&#146; rights and to general equity
principles.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;C. <U>Non-Contravention</U>. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default
under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a
party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or
regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;D. <U>Ownership of Shares</U>. Shareholder has good
title to all of the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set
forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares are so owned free and clear of any
liens, security interests, charges or other encumbrances.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Specific Performance and Remedies</U>.
Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money
the damage to Parent if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations
imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure,
Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity.
Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate
remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such
relief on the basis that Parent has an adequate remedy at law.
Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive
any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with
Parent&#146;s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after
discussing the matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to
inform any third party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be
contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from
Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of
this Agreement and of the rights of Parent hereunder, and that
participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in
violation of Shareholder&#146;s agreement with Parent set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such third party.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <U>Term of Agreement; Termination</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;B. This Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time of the
Merger or the earlier of (i)&nbsp;at any time prior to consummation of the
Merger by the written consent of the parties hereto and (ii)
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions
hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing
signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by
either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by
any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver
of any provision hereof by such party. No party hereto may assign any
rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, except as required
by Section&nbsp;2 or upon the prior written consent of each other party.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person or entity, other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>Notices</U>. Notices may be provided to Parent
and the Shareholder in the manner specified in the Merger Agreement, with
all notices to the Shareholder being provided to him or her at the
