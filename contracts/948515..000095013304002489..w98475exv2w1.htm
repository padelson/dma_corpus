 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 (i) each share of Parent Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger;    

 (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; and    

 (iii) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock) shall become and be converted into the right to receive 1.241 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.01(b) and Section 8.01(i), the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration") or, at the election of a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.02(a), 1.055 shares of Parent Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.01(b) and Section 8.01(i), the "Stock/Cash Exchange Ratio") and $6.12 in cash, without interest (the "Stock/Cash Consideration"). The Stock Consideration and the Stock/Cash Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration."   

 (b) The Exchange Ratio and the Stock/Cash Exchange Ratio shall be subject to appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities through reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other like changes in ParentÂ’s capitalization (a "Capital Change"). In addition, if Parent enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of Parent Common Stock would be converted, prior to the Effective Time, into shares or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each Company shareholder shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time such number of shares or other securities or amount of obligations of such other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such conversion.   

 3.02. _Election Procedures_.   

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to an unaffiliated bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent")) in such form as the Company    ##### 

  

 

and Parent shall mutually agree (the "Election Form"), shall be mailed
no later than 15 days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on such
earlier date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the "Mailing
Date") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of a date which is
no more than ten days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record
Date"). Each Election Form shall permit each holder of record of Company
Common Stock as of the Election Form Record Date (or in the case of nominee
record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to elect to receive the Stock/Cash Consideration for all or
some of such holderÂ’s shares (a "Stock/Cash Election") and shall provide that
in the absence of such an election by a holder all of such holderÂ’s shares of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the Stock Consideration. Holders
of record of shares of Company Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees,
trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative") may
submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such Representative certifies
that each such Election Form covers all the shares of Company Common Stock
held by that Representative for a particular beneficial owner.    

 (b) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th calendar day following but not including the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline").   

 (c) An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If a holder of Company Common Stock either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes the holderÂ’s Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be converted into the Stock Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Parent shall cause the Certificates described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the Person who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.   

 3.03. _Exchange Procedures_.   

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, (i) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock and deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates evidencing such number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and (ii) Parent shall deliver, or cause Parent Bank to deliver, to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article III in exchange for Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, and any such cash are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any    ##### 

  

 

rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock held
by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to
such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.    

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and provided that the Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01 of this Agreement (which in all such cases shall be comprised of the Stock Consideration). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of the Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a check representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and/or (iii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.03(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 3.03. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.03. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.03, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate.   

 (d) The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 3.03, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by Parent. If any certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance    ##### 

  

 

thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.    

 (e) At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article III. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and any payment of cash as provided herein.   

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.03(b) shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Parent (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.   

 (g) Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.   

 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Company Affiliate shall not be exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Affiliate may    ##### 

  

 

be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until Parent has received
a written agreement from such person as specified in Section 6.13.    

 3.04. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of the Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Date (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal,_ or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.   

 3.05 _Company Options_.   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is then outstanding, whether or not exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company Option, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors shall be substituted for the Company and the committee of the Company Board (including, if applicable, the entire Company Board) administering such Company Stock Option Plan, (ii) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest share, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each Company Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. Accordingly, with respect to any Company Option which is an incentive stock option, fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares and where necessary the per share exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. Parent and the Company agree to take all necessary steps to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05.   

 (b) Within five Business Days after the Effective Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.06 and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain outstanding in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form S-3, until the shares subject to    ##### 

  

 

such options may be sold without a further holding period under Rule 144
under the Securities Act.

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.08, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate reasonably in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation    #####

the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and
regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking agency or a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08.   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.08 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 6.09 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who become employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the "Transferred Employees") shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each Parent Benefit Plan of general applicability to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Parent Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans and that any grants to any former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any equity compensation plan of Parent shall be discretionary with Parent). To the extent that Transferred Employees are not entitled to participate in any Parent Benefit Plan effective as of the Effective Time, such employees shall continue to participate in the corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company and its Subsidiaries so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in participation or coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation or coverage), as applicable, prior to participation in such Parent Benefit Plan; provided that in no event shall Parent be required to continue any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company for which there is no corresponding Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall cause each Parent Benefit Plan in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Parent Benefit Plans (other than for benefit accruals under ParentÂ’s defined benefit pension plan) the service of such    ##### 

  

 

employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities) to the same extent as such service was credited generally for such
purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.    

 (b) If Transferred Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health or disability plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, dental or disability plans of Parent, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.   

 (c) An employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than in each case any employee who is party to an employment agreement or a change-in-control agreement) whose employment terminates under circumstances entitling him or her to salary continuation under the terms of the Company Bank Employee Severance Compensation Plan as in effect on the date hereof (the "Company Bank Severance Policy") during the one-year period following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the Company Bank Severance Policy. The Company Bank Severance Policy shall not be amended in a manner adverse to participants prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time.   

 (d) Except as set forth in Section 6.09(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified in Section 5.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including without limitation any benefits or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination with any other event).   

 (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.09, nothing contained in this Section 6.09 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings in accordance with their terms and applicable law.   

 6.10. _The Bank Merger_. Parent and the Company agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to cause the Company Bank to merge with and into Parent Bank in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement, it being the intention of the Parties that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately prior to the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a) Parent shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause Parent Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, and (b) the Company shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of the Company Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause the Company Bank to    ##### 

  

 

execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank
Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of the Company Bank.
The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain terms that are normal and customary
in light of the transactions contemplated hereby and such additional terms as
are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.    

 6.11. _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; provided that a failure to comply with this Section 6.11 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, or give rise to any right of termination under Section 8.01(d) or (e), unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied or the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.01(d) or (e), as the case may be. From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each of Parent and the Company will supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and Parent contained in Article V in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a) hereof, respectively, or the compliance by the Company and Parent with their respective covenants and agreements contained herein.   

 6.12. _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with representatives of Parent and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees to provide Parent (or make available to Parent in the case of documents filed with the SEC) (i) within ten Business Days following the close of each calendar month between the date hereof and the Effective Time (20 Business Days in the case of the month of December), a consolidated statement of financial condition at the end of such month and comparative consolidated statements of operations for such month and the same month in the prior year, (ii) a copy of each report filed by the Company and the Company Bank with a Governmental Authority within three Business Days following the filing thereof and (iii) monthly updates of the information required to be set forth in Section 5.01(v)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company will promptly notify Parent of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep Parent fully informed of such events.   

 6.13. _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify those persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (the "Company Affiliates") and to cause each    ##### 

  

 

person so identified to deliver to Parent as soon as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Closing Date, a written agreement with respect to
compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act in
connection with the sale or other transfer of Parent Common Stock received in
the Merger, which agreement shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit
6.13 hereto.    

 6.14. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.   

 6.15. _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(a) and 7.01(b); and further provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of the Company or its management with any such adjustments.   

 6.16. _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock into shares of Parent Common Stock and Company Options into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.15. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Parent Board, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and of options to purchase Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Options, in each case pursuant to the Merger and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the number and description of the Company Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the requirement for a description of any Company Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Company Stock Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Company Options have been granted have been made available to Parent. "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting    ##### 

  

 

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in
the Section 16 Information.    

 6.17. _Certain Other Agreements_.   

 (a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by the Company and Parent, the Company, the Company Bank and each of David F. Holland, David Conley, John Simas, Shawn McGee, John Mullen, Jan Forsler, Dennis Furey, Mark Kellet, Stephen Kelly, Dennis Kildulf, Barbara Martin and Marylea Oates shall enter into a Termination and Release Agreement substantially in the forms previously agreed to by Parent and the Company and included in Section 6.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Release Agreements").   

 (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by the Company and Parent, Parent and David F. Holland shall enter into an Employment Agreement in the form previously agreed to by Parent and Mr. Holland and included in Section 6.17(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

ARTICLE VIII    

TERMINATION    

 8.01. _Termination_ _._ This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:   

 (a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company if the Board of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.   

 (b) _No Regulatory Approval_. By the Company or Parent, if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event any Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied by final, nonappealable action by such Governmental Authority or a Governmental Authority shall have requested the permanent withdrawal of an application therefor.   

 (c) _No Shareholder Approval_. By the Board of Directors of either Parent or the Company (provided that in the case of the Company it shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.02), if the approval of the shareholders of the Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to    ##### 

  

 

obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof.    

 (d) _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. By the Board of Directors of either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other Party, which breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the Party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation or warranty not to consummate the Merger hereby under Section 7.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by Parent) or Section 7.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by the Company).   

 (e) _Breach of Covenants_. By the Board of Directors of either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating Party is not then willfully in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other Party, which breach shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching Party of written notice of such breach from the other Party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing, provided, however, that neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the Party receiving the benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the Merger under Section 7.02(b) in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement by Parent or Section 7.03(b) in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement by the Company.   

 (f) _Delay_. By the Board of Directors of either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May 31, 2005, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material breach of this Agreement by the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement.   

 (g) _Failure to Recommend_.

 (h) _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By the Board of Directors of Parent if a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company    ##### 

  

 

Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and
the Board of Directors of the Company recommends that shareholders of the
Company tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or
otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer
or exchange offer within the 10 business day period specified in Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.    

 (i) _Possible Adjustment_. By the Company, if the Company Board so determines by the vote of a majority of all of its members, at any time during the three-day period commencing with the Determination Date, if both the following conditions are satisfied:    

 (1) the Average Share Price shall be less than 82.5% of the Starting Price; and    

 (2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Share Price by the Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio") shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Average Index Price by the Starting Index Price and subtracting 0.175 from such quotient (such number being referred to herein as the "Index Ratio");  

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If the Company elects
to exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall give written notice to Parent (provided that such notice
of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the
aforementioned three-day period). During the three-day period commencing with
its receipt of such notice, Parent shall have the option of increasing the
consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock hereunder
by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (i) a number equal to
the quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth) determined by
dividing the product of the Starting Price, 0.825 and the Exchange Ratio by
the Average Share Price and (ii) a number equal to the quotient (rounded to
the nearest one ten-thousandth) determined by dividing the product of the
Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio by the Parent Ratio. If Parent makes an
election contemplated by the preceding sentence within such three-day period,
it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the
revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 8.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to
this Section 8.01(i). In the event of an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this Section 8.01(i), the Stock/Cash Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted in the same manner as the Exchange Ratio.    

 For purposes of this Section 8.01(i), the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them below.   

 "Average Index Price" means the average closing values of the NASDAQ Bank Index (the "Bank Index") for the ten trading-day period ending on (and including) the Determination Date.   

 "Average Share Price" means the average of the per share closing prices of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source) for the ten trading-day period ending on (and including) the Determination Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent.    ##### 

  

  

 "Determination Date" means the later of (i) the date on which the last approval of a Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Transactions has been obtained, without regard to any waiting period in respect thereof, and (ii) the date on which the condition set forth in Section 7.01(a) shall have been satisfied.   

 "Starting Index Price" means $2,837.93, the closing value of the Bank Index on June 18, 2004.   

 "Starting Price" means $32.64.   

 8.02. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.   

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no Party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any other Party hereunder except (i) as set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 9.01 and (ii) that termination will not relieve a breaching Party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.   

 (b) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by Parent while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the Parties hereto agree that the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $7.3 million (the "Company Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:    

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or (h), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent on the first Business Day following such termination;    

 (ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to the meeting of shareholders of the Company contemplated by Section 6.02, or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal and shall not have publicly withdrawn such announcement, communication or intention prior to the meeting of shareholders of the Company contemplated by Section 6.02, and if within 18 months after such termination of this Agreement the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction which is the subject of, an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee on the earlier of the date of execution of such agreement or consummation of such transaction; and    

 (iii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e), (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before such termination an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall been publicly announced, or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known, or communicated or made known to the senior management of the Company, an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, (C) following the occurrence of an event specified in clause (B),    ##### 

  

   

the Company shall have intentionally breached (and not cured after notice
thereof) any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach shall have materially contributed to
the failure of the Effective Time to occur prior to the termination of this
Agreement, and (D) if within 18 months after such termination of this
Agreement the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction which is the subject
of, an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Company Termination Fee on the earlier of the date of execution of such
agreement or consummation of such transaction.   

 Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent.   

 (c) The Company and Parent agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) of this Section 8.02 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Company. If the Company fails to pay Parent the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified therein, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action in which Parent prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall be obligated, subject to the terms of this Section 8.02, to pay only one Company Termination Fee.   

ARTICLE IX    

MISCELLANEOUS    

 9.01. _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections 6.06(c), 8.02 and, excepting Section 9.13 hereof, this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a Party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including without limitation any shareholder or former shareholder.   

 9.02. _Standard_. No representation or warranty of a Party contained in Section 5.01 or 5.02, as applicable, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no Party shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together    ##### 

  

 

with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any
representation or warranty contained in Section 5.01 or 5.02, as applicable,
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
such Party (disregarding for purposes of this Section 9.02 any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualification contained in any representation or

 9.08. _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto) and the Bank Merger Agreement, together with Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, represent the entire understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement and the Shareholder Agreements supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made, other than the Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in Section 6.08.   

 9.09. _Severability_ _._ Except to the extent that application of this Section 9.09 would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.    ##### 

  

  

 9.10. _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that a Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity.   

 9.11. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to June 20, 2004.   

 9.12. _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   

 9.13. _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the Merger and/or the Bank Merger subject to the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that (i) the Merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Article III hereof is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii) there are no adverse tax consequences to the shareholders of the Company as a result of such modification, (iii) there are no adverse tax consequences to Parent or the Company as a result of such modification and (iv) such modification will not jeopardize or materially delay receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities or otherwise impede or materially delay consummation of the Merger.

EXHIBIT A    

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT    

 SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of June 20, 2004, by and between _ _, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of BostonFed Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, and Banknorth Group, Inc. ("Parent"), a Maine corporation. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).   

 WHEREAS, Parent and the Company are simultaneously entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended from time to time pursuant to its terms, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Parent on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection therewith, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.241 shares of Parent Common Stock or, at election of a holder of Company Common Stock, 1.055 shares of Parent Common Stock and $6.12 in cash, without interest, plus in each case cash in lieu of any fractional share interest; and   

 WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Company Common Stock identified on Annex I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and   

 WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such ShareholderÂ’s capacity as a shareholder of the Company and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement;   

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:    

 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of the Company at which a proposal of the type set forth in clause (ii) below is presented for consideration by the shareholders of the Company, Shareholder shall:    

 (i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and    

 (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with,    ##### 

  

   

delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation
of the Merger or this Agreement.    

 2\. _No Transfers_. After the date hereof and prior to the special meeting of the Company shareholders held to consider and vote upon approval of the Merger Agreement, Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares if such sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or disposition could occur prior to such meeting, except the following transfers shall be permitted: (i) transfers by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, subject to applicable law, (ii) transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iv) transfers to any other shareholder of the Company who has executed a copy of this Agreement on the date hereof with respect to some or all of the Shares held by such shareholder, (v) transfers or dispositions to the Company for the surrender or delivery of Shares for the payment of the exercise price of outstanding stock options, the payment or withholding of applicable taxes in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or any other surrender or deemed surrender of Shares in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and (vi) such transfers as Parent may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.    

 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Parent as follows:    

 A. _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to
enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.    

 B. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights and to general
equity principles.    

 C. _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or
any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is
a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation
to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other
organizational document of Shareholder.    ##### 

  

   

 D. _Ownership of Shares_. Shareholder has good title to all of the Shares
as of the date hereof, and, except as set forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares
are so owned free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges or
other encumbrances.    

 4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Parent if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Parent has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with ParentÂ’s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to inform any third party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Parent hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of ShareholderÂ’s agreement with Parent set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such third party.    

 5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.    

 A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.    

 B. This Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time of the Merger or
the earlier of (i) at any time prior to consummation of the Merger by the
written consent of the parties hereto and (ii) termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however,
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.    

 6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. No party hereto may assign any rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, except as required by Section 2 or upon the prior written consent of each other party. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.    

 7\. _Notices_. Notices may be provided to Parent and the Shareholder in the manner specified in the Merger Agreement, with all notices to the Shareholder being provided to him or her at the address set forth in Annex I hereto.    ##### 

  

   

 8\. _Miscellaneous_.    

 A. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or
application shall be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity
or unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid
or unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons
or circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and
the remainder of this Agreement, shall not be affected.    

 B. _Capacity_. The covenants contained herein shall apply to Shareholder
solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and no
covenant contained herein shall apply to Shareholder in his or her capacity
as a director, officer or employee of the Company or in any other fiduciary
capacity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or
limit in any manner, the obligations of the Shareholder to comply with his
or her fiduciary duties as a director of the Company.    

 C. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.    

 D. _Headings_. All Section headings herein are for convenience of
reference only and are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or
reference shall be derived therefrom.    

 E. _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made under,
and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Maine, without reference to its conflicts of law principles.   

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first written above.
