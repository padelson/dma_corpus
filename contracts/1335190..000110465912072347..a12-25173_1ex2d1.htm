this Agreement in respect of a breach that would be cured by such Supplemental
Disclosures, including any rights or remedies under _Article 10_, and such
Supplemental Disclosure shall not be effective to cure and correct for any
purpose any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which

(a) _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_. Seller Representative shall cause to be
timely prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Company Group, applicable Law and this Agreement all Income Tax Returns with
respect to the Company Group for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due
after the Closing Date, including for those jurisdictions and Tax authorities
that permit or require a short period Income Tax Return for the period ending
on and including the Closing Date. The Sellers shall cause any income, gain,
loss or deduction resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections to be
included in each such Tax Return for a taxable period ending on the Closing
Date to the extent required by applicable Law. The Sellers shall bear the
costs of the preparation of all such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall provide to

prepaid assets, fixed asset schedules for the current year additions broken

returns, oil and gas revenue broken down by state, other revenue broken down

provide Purchaser with copies of each such Tax Return at least 10 days before
the due date (including extensions) for filing thereof. Purchaser shall have
no right to comment upon any such Tax Returns so long as on the Closing Date
the Company is treated as an S corporation and its Subsidiaries are treated
either as qualified subchapter S subsidiaries or as disregarded entities or
partnerships for federal income tax purposes (and state and local tax
purposes, as applicable) and there is no Tax due under Section 1374 of the
Code (or any similar provision of state of local Law). Purchaser and Seller
agree that Ernst Nepa shall continue to be an officer of the Company Group
after the Closing Date for the purpose of executing such Tax Returns as an
officer and on behalf of the Company Group.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Other Tax Returns_. All Tax Returns other than described in _Section
8.1(a)_ with respect to the Company Group after the Closing Date shall be

pay any Taxes due and owing with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



 

(c) _Partnership Returns_. The following rules shall apply with respect to the
Tax Returns of any partnership (as determined for federal Tax purposes and
where applicable state and local purposes) in which any member of the Company
Group is a partner on the Closing Date (the " _Partnership_ "). To the extent
the Partnership is terminated under Section 708(b)(1)(B) as a result of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Seller Representative shall cause to be
timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice, applicable Law and
this Agreement all Income Tax Returns of the Partnership for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, provided that Seller Representative has authority to prepare and
file such Tax Returns on behalf of the Partnership. All other Tax Returns of
the Partnership shall be prepared by Purchaser as a complete termination of
the Companys interest in the Partnership under Section 706(c) of the Code,
and the amount of any income, gain, deduction or credit allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books through (and including) the Closing Date to the extent permitted by the
applicable partnership agreement or applicable Law and otherwise by use of the
pro ration method provided by Treasury Regulation 1.706. Any income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
included in the Income Tax Returns of the Sellers for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

Section 8.3 **_Refunds_**. The amount of any refund of any Tax (including any
refundable Tax credit) other than Income Tax of any member of the Company
Group attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is received by Purchaser
or any member of the Company Group shall be the property of the Purchaser and
any refund of any Income Tax shall be the property of the Sellers.

 



 

Section 8.4 **_Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_**. Any and all
existing Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnity agreement binding upon
any member of the Company Group and another Person other than a member of the
Group, shall be terminated as of the date before the Closing Date and, on and

any further rights or Liabilities thereunder.

 



 

Section 8.5 **_Section 338(h)(10) Elections_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Parties intend the Transactions to be treated, and agree to treat the
Transactions, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and for all applicable
state and local income Tax purposes), (i) as a fully taxable sale of the
Shares by the Sellers to Purchaser, and (ii) as a "qualified stock purchase"
within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code. The Parties agree to
prepare and file all Tax Returns to be filed with any Tax authority in a
manner consistent with the foregoing and further agree to not take any
position inconsistent therewith. Sellers and Purchaser shall make a joint
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any comparable
provision of applicable state and local Law with respect to Purchasers
purchase of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Elections_").

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax item
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections on their Tax Returns to the
extent required by applicable Law. Sellers shall pay any Tax incurred by any
member of the Company Group that is imposed by Section 1374 of the Code and
any analogous state or local Tax that results from the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections. Purchaser and the Sellers shall take all necessary steps and
cooperate in good faith, including the exchange of information, to effect and
preserve valid and timely Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Unless required by
applicable Law, (1) each of the Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates to, report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects
and for all purposes consistent with the 338(h)(10) Elections, and (2) no
Party shall take, or shall cause any of its Affiliates to take, any position
that is inconsistent with the 338(h)(10) Elections.

 



 

(b) At least ten days before Closing, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with a
list of the states for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election would be made and a
copy of a blank election form, if any applicable for each state. At the
Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser an Internal Revenue Service
Form 8023, Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock
Purchases, and any corresponding forms under comparable provisions of
applicable state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the Section
338(h)(10) Elections, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
and duly executed by each Seller. As requested from time to time by Sellers or
Purchaser (whether before, at, or after the Closing), the Sellers and
Purchaser shall assist each other in, and shall provide the necessary
information to each other, in connection with the preparation of any other
forms and documentation required to effect valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Elections. Upon delivery of any other additional forms or documentation by
Purchaser to the Sellers, the Sellers shall cause any additional form or
documentation to be duly executed and promptly deliver such executed
additional form or documentation to Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible
for the timely filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections with the appropriate
Tax authority and shall provide the Seller Representative with a copy of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election forms as filed within five days after filing.

 



 

Section 8.6 **_"S" Election_**. Neither any member of the Company Group nor
any Seller shall revoke the Companys election to be an S corporation, and
neither any member of the Company nor any Seller shall take or allow any
action to be taken (other than the consummation of the Transactions) that
would result in the termination of either of the Companys status as an S
corporation. No Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall revoke or
allow any action to be taken (other than the consummation of the Transactions)
that would result in the termination of any Companys Subsidiarys election to
be treated as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary or disregarded entity.

 



 

Section 8.7 **_Cooperation_**. Each of the Parties and MHR shall provide any
other Party with such cooperation and information as such Party may request in
filing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Article 8_ or in connection with any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of any member of the Company
Group. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns of the Company Group or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Tax authorities. Each Party agrees to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to the members of the
Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period

 



      
 

 



 

for the full period of any statute of limitations of the respective Pre-
Closing Tax Period (and, to the extent notified by another Party, any
extensions thereof). Each of the Parties shall give prompt written notice to
the other Parties if the notifying Party receives any communication or notice
with respect to any audit, assessment, or administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to the Taxes of any member of the Company Group for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Each Party further agrees, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document

be imposed on any such Party with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

for which the Sellers could be liable under _Section 10.2_ or which could
affect the Tax Liability of any Seller (a " _Tax Matter_ "), and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, however, that the Sellers
acknowledge that they are jointly and severally indemnifying MHR, Purchaser
and the Company Group to the extent provided under _Article X_ for any
Liability in connection therewith. Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause
the Company Group to reasonably cooperate with Seller Representative and its
counsel in the defense or compromise of any Tax Matter. Purchaser shall be

expense. Except for all matters that are expressly left to the sole
representation of Seller Representative under this _Section 8.8_, Purchaser

10.2(b)(iii)_, provided that the Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and any amended Income Tax Returns have been prepared consistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and that the representations and warranties in
_Section 3.7(n)_ are true and correct through the Closing Date, and provided
further that Seller Representative shall provide a copy of any such amended
Income Tax Return (together with supporting schedules) to Purchaser at least
30 days prior to the date the amended Income Tax Returns are filed with a

Indemnification Claim, (2) the Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will have
the financial resources to defend against the Indemnification Claim and pay,
in cash, all Damages the Indemnitee may suffer resulting from, relating to,
arising out of, or attributable to the Indemnification Claim, (3) the
Indemnification Claim involves only money Damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief, (4) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Indemnification Claim is not in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnitee likely to establish a precedential custom or
practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnitee, and (5) the Indemnitor continuously conducts the defense of the
Indemnification Claim actively and diligently.

 



 

(iii) So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the
Indemnification Claim in accordance with _Section 10.4(a)(ii)_, (1) the
Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Indemnification Claim, (2) the Indemnitee
will not consent to the entry of any Order with respect to the Indemnification
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (not to be withheld
unreasonably), and (3) the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any
Order with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee (not to be withheld unreasonably, provided that it
will not be deemed to be unreasonable for an Indemnitee to withhold its
consent (A) with respect to any finding of or admission (1) of any violation
of any Law, Order or Permit, (2) of any violation of the rights of any Person,
or (3) which Indemnitee believes could have a material adverse effect on any
other Proceeding to which the Indemnitee or its Affiliates are party or to
which Indemnitee has a good faith belief they may become party, or (B) if any
portion of such Order would not remain sealed).

 



 

(iv) If a firm offer is made to settle a claim without leading to liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation or restriction on the part of
any Indemnitee and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release
of each Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such claim, then the Indemnitee shall give written notice to that effect to
the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor desires to accept and agree to such firm
offer, it shall provide written notice to that effect to the Indemnitee. If
the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within fifteen Business
Days after its receipt of the written notice from the Indemnitor indicating
its desire to accept and agree to such firm offer, the Indemnitee may continue
to contest or defend such claim and in such event, the maximum liability of
the Indemnitor as to such claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to
assume defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor may settle the claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such claim.

 



 

(v) If any condition in _Section 10.4(a)(ii)_ is or becomes unsatisfied, (1)
the Indemnitee may defend against, and consent to the entry of any Order with
respect to, an Indemnification Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate
(and the Indemnitee need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, any
Indemnitor in connection therewith), (2) each Indemnitor will jointly and
severally be obligated to reimburse the Indemnitee promptly and periodically
for the Damages relating to defending against the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnification Claim, and (3) each Indemnitor will remain jointly and
severally Liable for any Damages the Indemnitee may suffer relating to the
Indemnification Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Article 10_.

 



 

(vi) Each Party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
Governmental Authority in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnitee
for purposes of any Indemnification Claim that an Indemnitee may have under
this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein,
and agrees that process may be served on such Party with respect to such claim
anywhere in the world.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 10.4_, the terms of _Section
11.5_ shall control with respect to the Retained Litigation Matters and the
Other Litigation Matters.

 



 

(b) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of Damages that
does not result from a third-party claim shall be asserted by the Indemnitee
giving the Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however relieve the indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnitor
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnitor shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof to the extent reasonably
practicable and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnitee. The Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice
to respond in writing to the Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnitor does not
so respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have
accepted the Indemnification claim and shall promptly provide the
indemnification required pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as
applicable.

 



 

Section 10.5 **_Limitations on Indemnification Liability of the Seller
Parties_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers aggregate Liability for money Damages under this _Article 10_
related to Breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article 3_ and _Article 4_ will not exceed $12,000,000, _provided_ that the
limitation contemplated hereby shall not be applicable with respect to the
Seller Indemnification Carve-Outs.

 



 

(b) If the Closing occurs, Sellers will have no Liability for money Damages
under this _Article 10_ related to Breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ unless and until the
aggregate Damages claimed under _Section 10.2_ (for Liabilities other than as
set forth in subsection (ii) below) exceed $250,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_
") in which event Sellers shall have Liability for such money Damages only in
excess of the Threshold Amount, _provided_ , that (i) the limitation
contemplated hereby shall not be applicable with respect to the Seller
Indemnification Carve-Outs, and (ii) with respect to any representation and
warranty regarding Taxes other than Income Taxes the Threshold Amount for
Breaches of such representation and warranty shall be $50,000 (rather than
$250,000).

 



 

(c) The Seller Parties liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
several and not joint (in an amount pro rata to each Sellers respective
percentage ownership of the

 



       
 

 



 

Shares as set forth in _Exhibit A_), except that Robert T. Healey and William
Healey shall be jointly and severally liable for all Damages.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Account is intended to secure in part Sellers indemnification
obligations under _Article 10_, and the Purchaser Indemnified Persons will
first seek to satisfy any Indemnification Claims from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement to the extent there are sufficient funds
in the Escrow Account therefor. If the Closing does not occur, or the Escrow
Account has been, or will be as a result of such Indemnification Claim,
reduced to zero or if it has been released, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
will be entitled to seek to satisfy any Indemnification Claims directly from
Sellers or the Company (if the Closing does not occur).

 



 

Section 10.6 **_Limitations on Purchaser s and MHRs Indemnification
Liability_** **.**

 



 

(a) Purchasers and MHRs aggregate Liability for money Damages under this
_Article 10_ related to Breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article 5_ will not exceed $12,000,000, ****_provided_ that the
limitation contemplated hereby shall not be applicable with respect to the
Purchaser Indemnification Carve-Outs.

 



 

(b) If the Closing occurs, Purchaser and MHR will have no Liability for money
Damages under this _Article 10_ related to Breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 5_ unless and until the aggregate
Damages claimed under _Section 10.3_ exceeds the Threshold Amount in which
event Purchaser shall have Liability for such money Damages only in excess of
the Threshold Amount, _provided_ , that the limitation contemplated hereby
shall not be applicable with respect to the Purchaser Indemnification Carve-
Outs.

 



 

Section 10.7 **_Certain Additional Provisions Relating to Indemnification_**
**.**

 



 

(a) The indemnification provided in this _Article 10_ will be applicable
whether or not the sole, joint, or contributory negligence of the Indemnitee
is alleged or proven. Indemnitees rights and remedies set forth in this
Agreement will survive the Closing and will not be deemed waived by the
Indemnitees consummation of the Transactions and will be effective regardless
of any inspection or investigation conducted, or the awareness of any matters
acquired (or capable or reasonably capable of being acquired), by or on behalf
of Indemnitee, or by its directors, officers, employees or representatives or
at any time (regardless of whether notice of such knowledge has been given to
Indemnitor), whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date with respect to any circumstances constituting a condition under this
Agreement, unless any waiver specifically so states.

 



 

(b) Except for: (i) claims of, or causes of action for which the remedy sought
is, equitable relief, specific performance or injunctive action, or (ii)
rights, claims and causes of action arising as a result of fraud or willful
misconduct, the indemnification provided by this _Article 10_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for any Indemnitee with respect to any
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations or
warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any covenants or
agreements made in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Seller
hereby agrees that it will not make any claim for indemnification or
contribution against

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser, any Purchaser Indemnified Person, the Company or its Subsidiaries
by reason of the fact that such Seller was a stockholder, manager, employee or
representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any claim
brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Person against any Seller relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions or that is based on any facts or
circumstances that form the basis for a claim for indemnification by a
Purchaser Indemnified Person hereunder.

 



 

(d) The following principles shall apply to this _Article 10_: (i) the right
to defend provided in _Section 10.4_ shall not apply to any third party claim
which is being defended under a policy of insurance or as to which an
insurance company is advancing defense costs; (ii) an Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery of any Damage under an
applicable insurance policy relating to an indemnified claim to the extent
such Indemnitee reasonably believes such Damage is recoverable under such
policy and shall take commercially reasonable actions to report any claim and
cooperate with any insurer, and (iii) in calculating the amount of any Damage,
the amount of proceeds (if any) actually received by an Indemnitee under any
insurance policy on account of such Damage (including the amount of such
proceeds (if any) received by such Indemnitee after payment has been made by
an Indemnitor to the Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 10_), net of any
costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or obtaining
such proceeds, shall be deducted, and to the extent of any such proceeds are
received by the Indemnitee after payment has been made by the Indemnitor to
the Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 10_ and have not been deducted from
the calculation of Damages, such amount shall be paid by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnitor as promptly as practicable following receipt thereof by the
Indemnitee.

 



 

(e) An Indemnitor shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnitee for any
individual claim where the Damages relating to such claim are less than $7,500
(the " _Eligible Claim Threshold_ "), _provided_ , that with respect to any
representation and warranty regarding Taxes other than Income Taxes, the
Eligible Claim Threshold shall be $1,250 (rather than $7,500). For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Damages relating to an individual claim exceed the
applicable Eligible Claim Threshold, then an Indemnitors liability for such
Damages will relate back to and include the first dollar of the aggregate
amount of Damages so claimed; provided further that such Damages will remain
subject to the Threshold Amount.

 



 

(f) Each of the representations and warranties that contains any "in all
material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality (or
correlative meaning) qualification shall be deemed to have been given as
though there were no such qualification for purposes of this _Article 10_,
including for purposes of determining the amount of Damages and whether any
Breach of representations or warranties have occurred.

 



 

(g) Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual intent
that (i) Purchaser not incur any extraordinary material liability of Company
existing on the Effective Date and not reflected in either the 2011 Balance
Sheet or the Latest Balance Sheet and (ii) the Sellers not be deprived of the
value of any extraordinary material asset of the Company existing on the
Effective Date and not reflected on either the 2011 Balance Sheet or the
Latest Balance Sheet. Accordingly, if at any time prior to the end of the
14-month period immediately following the Closing Date Purchaser or Sellers
become aware of any such extraordinary material liability and/or any such
extraordinary material asset, Purchaser and Sellers shall

 



      
 

 



 

mutually cooperate and endeavor to make any net adjustment relating to the
consideration payable under this Agreement as shall be reasonable and
appropriate to take such extraordinary material liability and/or extraordinary
material asset into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 10.7(g)_ shall affect the representations, warranties and
indemnification obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11 
POST-CLOSING COVENANTS**

 



 

The Parties and MHR agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing:

 



 

Section 11.1 **_General_**. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
each Party and MHR will take such further action (including, the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the requesting Partys sole cost and expense
(unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
_Article 10_). Sellers acknowledge and agree that Purchaser will be entitled
to possession of all documents, books, records, agreements, and financial data
of any sort relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the
Closing, and therefore, Sellers will cause all such books, records, agreements
and financial data to be delivered to Purchaser promptly following the
Closing, but in no event later than five Business Days following the Closing,
at Purchasers offices in Reno, Ohio.

 



 

Section 11.2 **_Dispute Support_**. So long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any Proceeding in connection with (a) the
Transactions or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, each other Party will cooperate with such Party and such
Partys counsel in the contest or defense, make available their personnel, and
provide such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be
necessary in connection with the contest or defense, at the sole cost and
expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or
defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article 10_).

 



 

Section 11.3 **_Transition_**. No Seller will take any action that is designed
or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Each Seller will refer all customer
inquiries relating to the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
Purchaser from and after the Closing.

 



 

Section 11.4 **_Release_**. Each Seller, on behalf of such Seller and each of
such Sellers heirs, representatives, and assigns, hereby **RELEASES AND
FOREVER DISCHARGES** Purchaser, MHR, and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, stockholders, controlling persons,
representatives, Affiliates, successors, assigns, and the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and collectively, "
_Releasees_ ") from any and all Proceedings, Orders, Damages, Liabilities, and
Contracts whatsoever, whether

 



      
 

 



 

known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in equity, which
such Seller or any of such Sellers respective heirs, representatives, or
assigns now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the respective
Releasees arising contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing or on account
of or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously
with or prior to the Closing, including any Liability of any nature whatsoever
relating to the Non-Acquired Entities (including any Liabilities arising out
of the Precedence Transactions and Precedence Agreements), any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether pursuant to their respective Organizational Documents, Contract or
otherwise and whether or not relating to Proceeding pending on, or asserted
after, the Closing, _provided_ _, however_, _that_ nothing contained herein
shall operate to release any obligations of Purchaser and MHR arising under
this Agreement. Each Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any Proceeding, or commencing, instituting,
or causing to be commenced, any Proceeding, of any kind against any Releasee,
based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

 



 

Section 11.5 **_Litigation Matters_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Retained Litigation Matters_. The following pertains to the Retained
Litigation Matters identified in subpart(a) of _Schedule 3.6_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 11.5_, **** the
Parties agree that, as of and after the Closing, Seller Representative shall
control, and defend against, the Retained Litigation Matters on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, with counsel of its choice, but reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser (and the Parties stipulate that counsel currently
representing the Company, as set forth in _Schedule 11.5_ , is satisfactory to
both Parties), and Seller Representative shall actively and diligently conduct
such defense of the Retained Litigation Matters. During such time, Seller
Representative shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed as to the status of
the Retained Litigation Matters and Seller Representative shall provide
Purchaser with copies of, and the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, all pleadings, court documents and other litigation materials relating
to the Retained Litigation Matters. Seller Representative shall not settle, or
consent to the entry of any Order with respect to, any matter pertaining to
the Retained Litigation Matters without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _that_
it will not be deemed to be unreasonable for Purchaser to withhold its consent
to the extent such settlement or Order (a) would reasonably be expected to
result in the aggregate amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties relating to the Retained Litigation Matters
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, all legal fees incurred by them in
connection therewith) exceeding the value (based on liquidation preference) of
the Depositary Shares remaining in the Escrow Account at such time, (b)
involves an injunction or other equitable relief, or (c) would reasonably be
likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to
the continuing business interests of the Purchaser, MHR or their respective
Affiliates. Purchaser shall be entitled to retain separate legal counsel and
other advisors for purposes of evaluating any such proposed settlement or
Order and keeping itself reasonably apprised as to the status of the Retained
Litigation Matters and the rights and obligations of the Purchaser Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Parties with respect thereto, and the reasonable costs and expenses of such
counsel and advisors shall be paid 50% by the Sellers and 50% by MHR.

 



 

(ii) In the event that Seller Representative does not fulfill its obligations
hereunder with respect to the Retained Litigation Matters, Purchaser may, upon
written notice to Seller Representative, immediately assume the Seller
Representatives defense of, and consent to the settlement or entry of any
Order with respect to, the Retained Litigation Matters on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in any manner it may deem appropriate (and
Purchaser need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, Seller
Representative in connection therewith).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
that there are claims by the Company against third Persons, including insurers
and counterclaims, to the extent related to the Retained Litigation Matters,
the Sellers shall be entitled to any such claims and the monetary recovery of
the same, and the Purchaser and MHR shall pay over to the Seller
Representative any such monetary award so long as Purchasers indemnity claims
are not in excess of the amount of the Escrow Account.

 



 

(iv) In accordance with _Section 10.2(a)(vii)_, the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Seller Parties from, and
the Seller Parties shall pay any and all Damages, directly or indirectly,
resulting from, relating to, arising out of, or attributable to the Retained
Litigation **** Matters (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all legal fees
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in connection therewith), which
shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to such matters.

 



 

(b) _Other Litigation Matters_. The following pertains to the Other Litigation
Matters identified in subpart(b) of _Schedule 3.6_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall pay the reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses of the
Other Litigation Matters (the " _Other Litigation Matters Legal Expenses_ ")
through the law firm of Theisen Brock, Marietta, Ohio on behalf of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Sellers shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser
from the results of the Proceedings, but shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons for the Other Litigation Matters Legal Expenses. Sellers
shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser for the legal fees, costs and
expense of any other legal counsel that may be retained by Purchaser for the
Other Litigation Matters. Purchaser shall control the conduct of the
Proceedings and any settlement of the Proceedings.

 



 

Section 11.6 **_Listing of the Depositary Shares_**. Purchaser and MHR shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Depositary Shares comprising
the Depositary Share Consideration to be listed on the NYSE MKT promptly
following MHRs reasonable determination, acting in good faith with reasonable
diligence and promptness, that the listing of such Depositary Shares will
satisfy the applicable minimum listing criteria of the NYSE MKT.

 



 

Section 11.7 **_Exchange Act Filings_**. For the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending on (and including) the date that is one year after the date
hereof, MHR shall timely file

 



      
 

 



 

(or, if applicable, furnish, submit or post) all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents and information (including definitive proxy or
information statements, exhibits and other information incorporated therein),
required to be filed, furnished, submitted or posted by MHR with the
Commission and each applicable securities exchange, including under the
Exchange Act and/or the Securities Act (including, without limitation, all
reports under Section 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and all materials
referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under
the Securities Act), and shall take such further action as any holder of
Depositary Shares may reasonably request to the extent required from time to
time to enable such holder to sell the Depositary Shares without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to
time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
Commission. Upon the request of any Seller holding Depositary Shares in
connection with that holders sale of Series E Preferred Stock or Depositary
Shares pursuant to Rule 144, MHR shall deliver to such holder a written
statement confirming that it has complied with such requirements.

 



 

Section 11.8 **_Transaction Bonuses_** **. **The Parties agree that the
Sellers shall be liable for payment of the full amounts of the Transaction
Bonuses and that any payment of such amounts by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
2.2_ shall create no obligation on the part of the Purchaser or MHR to the
recipients of such bonus payments.

 



 

Section 11.9 **_Employment Matters_**. Immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company will terminate the employment of the employees identified on _Schedule
3.13_. Immediately following closing, Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
will offer employment on an "at will" basis to all employees identified on
_Schedule 3.13_. The employees that accept the offer of employment are
referred to as " _Transferred Employees_." The Transferred Employees will be
able to participate in employee benefit plans and be subject to the same terms
and conditions of employment as similarly situated employees of Purchaser.
Purchaser and its Affiliates will credit each Transferred Employee with paid
time off for the remainder of the year following Closing with the amount of
accrued but unused paid time off credited to each Transferred Employer by the
Company prior to Closing. Purchaser and its Affiliates will recognize service
with the Company and any of its Affiliates prior to Closing for purposes of
vesting in qualified retirement plan contributions, and the calculation of
vacation benefits (to the extent they are calculated based on service).

consecutive or non-consecutive (a " _Dividend Default_ "), then:

 



 

(i) the Dividend Rate shall increase to the Penalty Rate, commencing on the
first day after the Dividend Payment Date on which a Dividend Default occurs
and for each subsequent Dividend Payment Date thereafter until such time as
the Corporation has paid all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Series E Preferred Shares in full and has paid accrued dividends for all
Dividend Periods during the two (2) most recently completed Quarterly Dividend
Periods in full in cash, at which time the Dividend Rate shall revert to the
Stated Rate;

 



 

(ii) on the next Dividend Payment Date following the Dividend Payment Date on
which a Dividend Default occurs, and continuing until such time as the
Corporation has paid all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Series E Preferred Shares in full and has paid accrued dividends for all
Dividend Periods during the two (2) most recently completed Quarterly Dividend
Periods in full in cash, the Corporation shall pay all dividends on the Series
E Preferred Shares, including all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends, on
each Dividend Payment Date either in cash or, if not paid in cash, by issuing
to the holders thereof (A) if the Common Shares are then subject to a National
Market Listing, registered Common Shares with a value equal to the amount of
dividends being paid, calculated based on the then-current Market Value of the
Common Shares, plus cash in lieu of any fractional Common Share; or (B) if the
Common Shares are not then subject to a National Market Listing, additional
Series E Preferred Shares with a value equal to the amount of dividends being
paid, calculated based on the twenty-five thousand dollar ($25,000.00) per
share stated liquidation preference of the Series E Preferred Shares (and
dividends on any such Series E Preferred Shares upon issuance shall accrue at
the Penalty Rate and accumulate until such time as the Dividend Rate shall
revert to the Stated Rate in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this
paragraph (b));

 



 

(iii) until such time as the Dividend Rate reverts to the Stated Rate pursuant
to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (b), the holders of Series E Preferred
Shares will have the voting rights described below in paragraph (a) of Section
8; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) to the extent that the Corporation determines a shelf registration
statement to cover resales of Common Shares or Series E Preferred Shares is
required in connection with the issuance of, or for resales of, such Common
Shares or Series E Preferred Shares issued as payment of a dividend, the
Corporation will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file and maintain
the effectiveness of such a shelf registration statement until such time as
all shares of such stock have been resold thereunder or such shares are
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

 



 

Following any Dividend Default that has been cured by the Corporation as
provided above in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (b), if the Corporation
subsequently fails to pay cash dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares in
full for any Dividend Period, such subsequent failure shall constitute a
separate Dividend Default, and the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (i),
(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph (b) shall immediately apply until such
subsequent Dividend Default is cured as so provided.

 



 

(c) Once the Series E Preferred Shares become initially eligible for National
Market Listing, if the Corporation fails to maintain a National Market Listing
for the Series E Preferred Shares for one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive
days or longer (a " _Listing Default_ "), then:

 



 

(i) the Dividend Rate shall increase to the Penalty Rate, commencing on the
day after the Listing Default and continuing until such time as the
Corporation has cured the Listing Default by again subjecting the Series E
Preferred Shares to a National Market Listing, at which time the Dividend Rate
shall revert to the Stated Rate; and

 



 

(ii) until such time as the Dividend Rate reverts to the Stated Rate pursuant
to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (c), the holders of Series E Preferred
Shares will have the voting rights described below in paragraph (a) of Section
8.

 



 

Following any Listing Default that has been cured by the Corporation as
provided above in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (c), if the Series E
Preferred Shares subsequently cease to be subject to a National Market
Listing, such event shall constitute a separate Listing Default, and the
foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (c) shall
immediately apply until such time as the Series E Preferred Shares are again
subject to a National Market Listing.

 



 

(d) The Corporation shall at all times keep reserved a sufficient number of
Common Shares or Series E Preferred Shares for the payment of dividends on the
Series E Preferred Shares as described above in paragraph (b) of this Section
3, and if a dividend is paid in shares of stock an amount equal to the
aggregate par value of the shares issued shall be designated as capital in
respect of such shares in accordance with Section 154 of the DGCL.

 



 

(e) No dividend on the Series E Preferred Shares will be declared by the
Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time
as the terms and provisions of Senior Shares or any agreement of the
Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit
such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or

 



       
 

 



 

provide that such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would
constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration,
payment or setting aside of funds is restricted or prohibited under the DGCL
or other applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares
shall continue to accrue and accumulate regardless of whether: (i) any or all
of the foregoing restrictions exist; (ii) the Corporation has earnings or
profits; (iii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such
dividends; or (iv) such dividends are authorized by the Board of Directors.
Accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares will accumulate
as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable or on the
date of redemption of the Series E Preferred Shares, as the case may be.

 



 

(f) Except as provided in the next sentence, if any Series E Preferred Shares
are outstanding, no dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for
payment on any Parity Shares or Junior Shares, unless all accumulated accrued
and unpaid dividends are contemporaneously declared and paid in cash or
declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for
such payment on the Series E Preferred Shares for all past Dividend Periods
with respect to which full dividends were not paid on the Series E Preferred
Shares either in cash or, as applicable, in Common Shares or Series E
Preferred Shares. When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for
such full payment is not so set apart for payment) upon the Series E Preferred
Shares and upon all Parity Shares, all dividends declared, paid or set apart
for payment upon the Series E Preferred Shares and all such Parity Shares
shall be declared and paid _pro rata_ or declared and set apart for payment
_pro rata_ so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series E
Preferred Shares and per share of such Parity Shares shall in all cases bear
to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share of Series E
Preferred Shares and such other Parity Shares (which shall not include any
accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such
other Parity Shares do not bear cumulative dividends) bear to each other. No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments on Series E Preferred Shares which may be in
arrears, whether at the Stated Rate or at the Penalty Rate.

 



 

(g) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section 3, unless all
accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares are
contemporaneously declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum of cash
sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past
Dividend Periods with respect to which full dividends were not paid on the
Series E Preferred Shares either in cash or, as applicable, in Common Shares
or Series E Preferred Shares, no dividends (other than in Common Shares or
Junior Shares ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Shares as to dividends
and upon liquidation) may be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon
the Common Shares or any Junior Shares or Parity Shares, nor shall any Common
Shares or any Junior Shares or Parity Shares be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired directly or indirectly for any consideration (or any monies
be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such
stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior
Shares, by redemption, purchase or acquisition of stock under any employee
benefit plan of the Corporation or a repurchase or acquisition of stock from a
director, manager, officer or employee of the Corporation or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof in connection with the termination of such persons service
or employment).

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Holders of Series E Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any
dividend, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of all
accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares as
described in this Section 3. Any dividend payment made on the Series E
Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated
accrued and unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains
payable at the time of such payment.

 



 

Section 4. _Liquidation Preference_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the rights of the holders of Senior Shares and Parity Shares,
in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the
assets of the Corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set
apart for the holders of Junior Shares, as to the distribution of assets on
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, each holder of
the Series E Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash
equal to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per Series E Preferred
Share plus an amount in cash equal to all accumulated accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of final
distribution to such holders. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof,
distributable among the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares shall be
insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating
payments on any other shares of any class or series of Parity Shares as to the
distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed
among the holders of Series E Preferred Shares and any such other Parity
Shares ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable
on such Series E Preferred Shares and any such other Parity Shares if all
amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4,
none of (i) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more
corporations or other entities, (ii) a sale, lease or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Corporations assets or (iii) a statutory share
exchange shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation.

 



 

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of Senior Shares and Parity Shares
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, after payment shall have been made in full
to the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares, as provided in this Section
4, any other series or class or classes of Junior Shares shall, subject to the
respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to
receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the
holders of the Series E Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to share
therein.

 



 

Section 5. _Redemption_.

 



 

(a) The Series E Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable by the Corporation
prior to **[ ]**, except as provided below in
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) of this Section 5. On and after
**[ ]**, the Corporation may redeem the Series E
Preferred Shares, in whole at any time or from time to time in part, at the
option of the Corporation, for cash, at a redemption price of twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per Series E Preferred Share, plus the amounts
indicated in paragraph (c) of this Section 5.

 



      
 

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) Following a Change of Ownership or Control, within ninety (90) days
following the date on which the Change of Ownership or Control has occurred,
the Corporation or the acquiring entity in such Change of Ownership or Control
will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem the Series E Preferred
Shares, in whole but not in part, for cash, at the redemption price of twenty-
five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per Series E Preferred Share, plus the
amounts indicated in paragraph (c) of this Section 5.

 



 

(ii) If on any twenty (20) Trading Days during any consecutive thirty
(30)-Trading Day period, the Trading Price per Common Share equals or exceeds
the product of one and twenty-nine hundredths (1.29) times the Conversion
Price (a " _Trading Price Event_ "), subject to any adjustments pursuant to
subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, then the
Corporation may redeem the Series E Preferred Shares, in whole at any time or
from time to time in part, at the option of the Corporation, for cash at a
redemption price of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per Series E
Preferred Share, plus the amounts indicated in paragraph (c) of Section 5.

 



 

(iii) If at any time the Corporation spins off or otherwise distributes to the
holders of its Common Shares capital stock or similar equity interests in a
subsidiary, business unit or other entity, the Conversion Price for
determining whether a Trading Price Event has occurred shall be reduced by
multiplying it by a fraction of which (A) the numerator will be the average
Trading Price of one (1) Common Share over the Spin-off Valuation Period (as
defined below) and (B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the
average Trading Price of one (1) Common Share over the ten (10) consecutive
Trading Day period (the " _Spin-off Valuation Period_ ") commencing on and
including the fifth (5th) Trading Day after the date on which "ex dividend
trading" commences on the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (or
other national securities exchange or national securities market on which the
Common Shares are then listed) and (y) the average Trading Price over the
Spin-off Valuation Period of the portion of the capital stock or similar
equity interests so distributed applicable to one (1) Common Share, such
adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on
the fifteenth (15th) Trading Day after the date on which "ex dividend trading"
commences.

 



 

(iv) If the Corporation or a subsidiary, business unit or other entity at
least some of whose equity securities are directly or indirectly owned by the
Corporation spins off or otherwise distributes capital stock or similar equity
interests in, or assets of, a subsidiary, business unit or other entity, other
than in the manner described in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (b) of this
Section 5 or in a manner that makes the adjustment contemplated thereby
unworkable, inappropriate or inapplicable, the Board of Directors, in good
faith and following consultation with outside legal counsel or financial
advisors, to the extent that the Board of Directors deems appropriate,
determines that a reduction to the Conversion Price for determining whether a
Trading Price Event has occurred is necessary or appropriate, then the
Corporation may, but shall not be obligated to, reduce such Conversion Price
to the extent and in the manner that the Board of Directors determines to be
appropriate.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Price for determining whether a
Trading Price Event has occurred shall be subject to any adjustments made
pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 14.

 



 

(c) Upon any redemption of Series E Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section
5, the Corporation (or, if applicable, the acquiring entity) shall, subject to
the next sentence, pay any accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends in arrears
for any Dividend Period ending on or prior to the Call Date. If the Call Date
falls after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend
Payment Date, then each holder of Series E Preferred Shares at the close of
business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend
payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date
notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment
Date. Except as provided above, the Corporation shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series E
Preferred Shares called for redemption.

 



 

(d) If all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred
Shares and any other class or series of Parity Shares of the Corporation have
not been paid in cash, Common Shares or Series E Preferred Shares (or, with
respect to any Parity Shares, in Parity Shares), or declared and set apart for
payment in cash, Common Shares or Series E Preferred Shares (or, with respect
to any Parity Shares, in Parity Shares) the Series E Preferred Shares shall
not be redeemed under this Section 5 in part, except in those circumstances
described in paragraph (c) of this Section 5, and the Corporation shall not
purchase or acquire Series E Preferred Shares, other than (i) pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of Series E
Preferred Shares and Parity Shares or (ii) in exchange for Junior Shares.

 



 

(e) Notice of the redemption of any Series E Preferred Shares under this
Section 5 shall be mailed by first class mail to each holder of record of
Series E Preferred Shares to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as
shown on the Corporations records, not less than thirty (30) nor more than
sixty (60) days prior to the Call Date; _provided that_ , if the Series E
Preferred Shares are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust
Company (" _DTC_ "), the Corporation may give such notice in any manner
permitted by DTC. Neither the failure to mail any notice required by this
paragraph (e) of Section 5, nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof,
to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the
validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders.
Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed
to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives
the notice. Each such mailed notice shall state, as appropriate: (1) the Call
Date; (2) the number of Series E Preferred Shares to be redeemed and, if fewer
than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price per Series E
Preferred Share (determined as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section 5, as applicable) plus accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends
through the Call Date (determined as set forth in paragraph (c) of this
Section 5); (4) if any shares are represented by certificates, the place or
places at which certificates for such shares are to be surrendered; (5) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Call Date
except as otherwise provided herein; and (6) any other information required by
law or by the applicable rules of any exchange or national securities market
upon which the Series E Preferred Shares may be listed or admitted for
trading. Notice having been

 



      
 

 



 

mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Call Date (unless the Corporation (or,
if applicable, the acquiring entity) shall fail to make available an amount of
cash necessary to effect such redemption), (i) except as otherwise provided
herein, dividends on the Series E Preferred Shares so called for redemption
shall cease to accrue, (ii) said shares shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding, and (iii) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Series
E Preferred Shares shall cease (except the right to receive cash payable upon
such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of
their certificates if so required and to receive any dividends payable
thereon).

 



 

(f) The Corporations (or, if applicable, the acquiring entitys) obligation
to provide cash in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be deemed
fulfilled if, on or before the Call Date, the Corporation (or, if applicable,
the acquiring entity) shall irrevocably deposit funds necessary for such
redemption, in trust, with a bank or trust company that has, or is an
affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, capital and surplus of at least
fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), with irrevocable instructions that such
cash be applied to the redemption of the Series E Preferred Shares so called
for redemption, in which case the notice to holders of the Series E Preferred
Shares will (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of
such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and
(iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates, if any, representing
such shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice
(which may not be later than the Call Date) against payment of the redemption
price (including all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends to the Call
Date, determined as set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section 5). No interest
shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of Series E Preferred Shares to be
redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation (or, if applicable, the
acquiring entity). Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed
at the end of six (6) months from the Call Date shall revert to the general
funds of the Corporation (or, if applicable, the acquiring entity) after which
reversion the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look only
to the general funds of the Corporation (or, if applicable, the acquiring
entity) for the payment of such cash.

 



 

(g) As promptly as practicable after the surrender in accordance with said
notice of the certificates, if any, for any such shares so redeemed (properly
endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation (or, if applicable, the
acquiring entity) shall so require and if the notice shall so state), such
shares shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which
such shares have been redeemed. If fewer than all the outstanding Series E
Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, shares to be redeemed shall be selected
by the Corporation from outstanding Series E Preferred Shares not previously
called for redemption by lot or _pro rata_ (as nearly as may be) or by any
other method determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion to be
equitable. If fewer than all the Series E Preferred Shares represented by any
certificate are redeemed, then new certificates representing the unredeemed
shares shall be issued without cost to the holder thereof.

 



 

Section 6. _Status of Acquired Shares_. All Series E Preferred Shares issued
and redeemed by the Corporation in accordance with Section 5 above, or
otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall be restored to the status of
authorized but unissued shares of undesignated Preferred Stock of the
Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7. _Ranking_. Any class or series of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to rank:

 



 

(a) prior to the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and
as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if
the holders of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of
dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series E
Preferred Shares (" _Senior Shares_ "), including the Corporations (i) 10.25%
Series C Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the " _Series C Preferred
Shares_"), which has been fully issued as of the date of this Certificate, and
(ii) 8.0% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock (the " _Series D Preferred
Shares_");

 



 

(b) on a parity with the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the payment of
dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or
redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of
the Series E Preferred Shares, if the holders of such class or series and the
Series E Preferred Shares shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends and of
amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in
proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per
share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the
other (" _Parity Shares_ "); and

 



 

(c) junior to the Series E Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends
and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, if such class or series shall be the Common Shares or any other class or
series of shares of stock of the Corporation now or hereafter issued and
outstanding over which the Series E Preferred Shares have preference or
priority in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (" _Junior
Shares_ ").

 



 

Section 8. _Voting Rights_. The Series E Preferred Shares shall have no voting
rights, except as set forth in this Section 8.

 



 

(a) In the circumstances identified in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of Section 3
hereof, the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall
increase by two (2), and the holders of Series E Preferred Shares, together
with the holders of shares of every other series of Parity Shares upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (any such other
series, the " _Voting Preferred Shares_ "), voting as a single class
regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect two (2) additional directors
at any annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in place
thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the Series E Preferred
Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares called as hereinafter provided. Such
voting rights shall continue until terminated as provided in subparagraph (b)
or (c) of Section 3 hereof, as applicable, whereupon the terms of all persons
elected as directors by the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and the
Voting Preferred Shares shall terminate and the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall decrease accordingly. At any time
after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of Series E
Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, the Secretary of the
Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series E
Preferred Shares (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the
Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series E
Preferred Shares and of

 



      
 

 



 

the Voting Preferred Shares for the election of the two (2) directors to be
elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to
that provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation for a special meeting of the
stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be
called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within seventy-
five (75) days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series E
Preferred Shares may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and
for that purpose shall have access to the share records of the Corporation for
the Series E Preferred Shares and Voting Preferred Shares. The directors
elected at any such special meeting shall serve until the next annual meeting
of the stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof and until their
successors are duly elected and qualified, if such term shall not have
previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the
directors elected by the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and the
Voting Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of
Directors, upon the nomination of the then-remaining director elected by the
holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares or
the successor of such remaining director, if any, to serve until the next
annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof
and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, if such term shall
not have previously terminated as provided above.

 



 

(b) So long as any Series E Preferred Shares are outstanding, the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Series E Preferred
Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, acting as a
single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose,
shall be necessary for effecting or validating:

 



 

(i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation or these terms of the Series E Preferred Shares
that materially and adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or
voting power of the Series E Preferred Shares or the Voting Preferred Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amendment of the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation so as to authorize or create, or to increase the
authorized amount of, the Series E Preferred Shares or any Junior Shares that
are not senior in any respect to the Series E Preferred Shares or the Voting
Preferred Shares, or any shares of any class ranking, as to receipt of
dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, on a parity with the Series E Preferred Shares or the
Voting Preferred Shares shall not be deemed to materially or adversely affect
the rights, preferences or voting power of the Series E Preferred Shares or
the Voting Preferred Shares; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such
amendment, alteration or repeal would materially and adversely affect any
voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series E Preferred Shares or
another series of Voting Preferred Shares that are not enjoyed by some or all
of the other series otherwise entitled to vote in accordance herewith, the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes entitled to be cast
by the holders of all series similarly affected, similarly given, shall be
required in lieu of the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series E Preferred Shares and
the Voting Preferred Shares otherwise entitled to vote in accordance herewith;

 



 

(ii) a statutory share exchange that affects the Series E Preferred Shares, a
consolidation with or merger of the Corporation into another entity, or a

 



      
 

 



 

consolidation with or merger of another entity into the Corporation, unless in
each such case each Series E Preferred Share (i) shall remain outstanding
without a material and adverse change to its terms, voting powers, preferences
and rights or (ii) shall be converted into or exchanged for preferred shares
of the surviving entity having preferences, conversion or other rights, voting
powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or distributions,
qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption thereof identical to that
of a Series E Preferred Share (except for changes that do not materially and
adversely affect the Series E Preferred Shares); _provided, however_ , that if
any such share exchange, consolidation or merger would materially and
adversely affect any voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series E
Preferred Shares or another series of Voting Preferred Shares that are not
enjoyed by some or all of the other series otherwise entitled to vote in
accordance herewith, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all series similarly affected,
similarly given, shall be required in lieu of the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series
E Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares otherwise entitled to vote
in accordance herewith; or

 



 

(iii) the authorization, reclassification or creation of, or the increase in
the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or any security convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of any class ranking prior to the Series E
Preferred Shares or the Voting Preferred Shares in the distribution of assets
on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or in the
payment of dividends;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such vote of the holders of Series E
Preferred Shares shall be required on or after **[ ]**
or a Trading Price Event, or in connection with a Change of Ownership or
Control, if at or prior to the time when such amendment, alteration, repeal,
share exchange, consolidation or merger is to take effect, or when the
issuance of any such prior shares or convertible security is to be made, as
the case may be, a deposit is made for the redemption in cash of all Series E
Preferred Shares at the time outstanding as provided in paragraph (f) of
Section 5 hereof for a redemption price determined under the appropriate
paragraph of Section 5.

 



 

Notwithstanding the first _proviso_ of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of
Section 8, so long as any Series E Preferred Shares are outstanding, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Series E
Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares at the time outstanding,
acting as a single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy,
either in writing without a meeting or by vote at a meeting called for the
purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating the amendment of the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation so as to authorize or create,
or to increase the authorized amount of, the Series E Preferred Shares, or any
shares of any class ranking, as to receipt of dividends or distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, on
parity with the Series E Preferred Shares or the Voting Preferred Shares.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Section 8, each Series E Preferred Share shall have
one vote per share, except that when any other series of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to vote with the Series E Preferred Shares as a single class on
any matter pursuant to the provisions

 



       
 

 



 

of the Certificate of Incorporation or as otherwise required by law, then the
Series E Preferred Shares shall have with respect to such matters one vote per
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) of stated liquidation preference. Except as set
forth herein, the Series E Preferred Shares shall not have any relative,
participating, optional or other special voting rights and powers other than
as set forth herein, and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be
required for the taking of any corporate action.

 



 

(d) Except as required by law, no amendment to these terms of the Series E
Preferred Shares shall require the vote of the holders of Common Shares or any
series of Preferred Stock other than the Voting Preferred Shares, Series C
Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares, as specifically provided for
herein and in each such shares respective certificate of designations.

 



 

Section 9. _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Corporation is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any Series E
Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall (a) transmit by mail
to all holders of Series E Preferred Shares, as their names and addresses
appear in the Corporations record books and without cost to such holders,
copies of the annual reports and quarterly reports that the Corporation would
have been required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the
Corporation was subject to such Sections (other than any exhibits that would
have been required); and (b) promptly upon written request, supply copies of
such reports to any prospective holder of Series E Preferred Shares. The
Corporation shall mail the reports to the holders of Series E Preferred Shares
within fifteen (15) days after the respective dates by which the Corporation
would have been required to file the reports with the SEC if the Corporation
were then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, assuming the
Corporation is a "non-accelerated filer" in accordance with the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 10. _Record Holders_. The Corporation and the Transfer Agent shall
deem and treat the record holder of any Series E Preferred Shares as the true
and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor the
Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 



 

Section 11. _Sinking Fund_. The Series E Preferred Shares shall not be
entitled to the benefits of any retirement or sinking fund.

 



 

Section 12. _Conversion at Option of Holder_.

 



 

(a) Each Series E Preferred Share shall be convertible, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time from and after the issuance thereof, except
as set forth in Section 13, at the option of the holder thereof, into the
number of Common Shares equal to the Conversion Ratio. Holders shall effect
conversions by providing notice to the Corporation through the Depositary,
**** in accordance with the customary terms and conditions set forth by the
Depositary (the " _Notice of Conversion_ "). If the Transfer Agent is
participating in DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer program, the Notice of
Conversion may specify, at the holders election, whether the applicable
Conversion Shares shall be credited to the account of the holders prime
broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system (a "
_DWAC Delivery_ "). The " _Conversion Date_ ," or the date on which a
conversion shall be deemed

 



      
 

 



 

effective, shall be defined as the Trading Day that the Notice of Conversion,
completed and executed, is received during regular business hours by, the
Corporation; _provided that_ , if applicable, the original certificate(s)
representing such Series E Preferred Shares being converted, duly endorsed,
are received by the Corporation within two (2) Trading Days after the
Corporations receipt of the Notice of Conversion. In all other cases, the
Conversion Date shall be defined as the first Trading Day on which the
Corporation has received each of the original Series E Preferred Shares being
converted, duly endorsed, and the accompanying Notice of Conversion.

 



 

(b) No fractional Common Shares or scrip representing fractional Common Shares
shall be issued upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Shares. In lieu
of fractional Common Shares, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay
a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such
fraction multiplied by the Trading Price on the Conversion Date or round up to
the next whole Common Share.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Not later than five (5) Trading Days after the applicable Conversion Date,
the Corporation shall (a) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting
holder a physical certificate or certificates representing the number of
Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred
Shares or (b) in the case of a DWAC Delivery, electronically transfer such
Conversion Shares by crediting the account of the holders prime broker with
DTC through its DWAC system.

 



 

(d) The Corporation shall at all times keep reserved a sufficient number of
Common Shares for issuance upon the conversion, as described in this Section
12, of all outstanding Series E Preferred Shares (taking into account the
adjustments set forth in Section 14). The Corporation covenants that all
Common Shares that shall be so issuable shall, upon issuance, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 



 

(e) The issuance of certificates, if any, for Common Shares upon conversion of
Series E Preferred Shares shall be made without charge to any holder of Series
E Preferred Shares for any documentary, stamp or similar taxes that may be
payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates, _provided
that_ the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such
certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the registered
holder(s) of such Series E Preferred Shares and the Corporation shall not be
required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or
Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the
amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Corporation that such tax has been paid.

 



 

(f) Upon each Conversion Date, (i) except as may otherwise occur pursuant to
Section 13, the Series E Preferred Shares being converted shall be deemed
converted into Common Shares and (ii) such holders rights as a holder of such
converted Series E Preferred Shares shall cease and terminate, excepting only
the right to receive certificates for such Common Shares, if applicable, and
to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to
such holder because of a failure by the Corporation to comply with the terms
of this Certificate.

 



 

Section 13. ___Conversion upon Change of Ownership or Control_.

 



 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Ownership or Control (the " _Change of
Ownership or Control Date_ "), each holder of Series E Preferred Shares shall
have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Ownership or Control Date such
holder has given a Notice of Conversion pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section
12 or prior to the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Date, the
Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the
Series E Preferred Shares pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of
Section 5, to convert some or all of the Series E Preferred Shares held by
such holder (the " _Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Right_ ") on the
Change of Ownership or Control Date into a theoretical number of Common Shares
per Series E Preferred Share to be converted (which theoretical Common Shares
will be entitled to the Conversion Consideration pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section 13, the " _Common Share Conversion Consideration_ ") equal to the
lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of (x) the twenty-
five thousand dollar ($25,000.00) per share stated liquidation preference plus
(y) the amount of any accumulated and

 



      
 

 



 

unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Change of Ownership or Control
Date (unless the Change of Ownership or Control Date is after a Dividend
Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which
case no additional amount for accumulated and unpaid dividends will be
included in such sum) by (B) the Common Share Price, and (ii) [
] (the " _Share Cap_ "), subject to any adjustments made pursuant to paragraph
(a) of Section 14.

 



 

(b) In the case of a Change of Ownership or Control pursuant to which Common
Shares shall be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets
(including any combination thereof) (the " _Change of Ownership or Control
Alternative Form Consideration_"), a holder of Series E Preferred Shares
shall receive upon conversion of such Series E Preferred Shares the kind and
amount of Change of Ownership or Control Alternative Form Consideration which
such holder of Series E Preferred Shares would have owned or been entitled to
receive upon the Change of Ownership or Control had such holder of Series E
Preferred Shares held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common Share
Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change
of Ownership or Control (the " _Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "). The
Common Share Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion
Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Ownership or Control, shall
be referred to herein as the " _Conversion Consideration_." No Conversion
Consideration will be paid to the holder of Series E Preferred Shares if the
Change of Ownership or Control is effected in such a manner that the holders
of Common Shares do not receive any Change of Ownership or Control Alternative
Form Consideration.

 



 

(c) In the event that holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect
the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Ownership or
Control, the consideration that the holders of Series E Preferred Shares shall
receive shall be in the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration
elected by the holders of the Common Shares who participate in the
determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and shall be
subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares are subject,
including, without limitation, _pro rata_ reductions applicable to any portion
of the consideration payable in the Change of Ownership or Control.

 



 

(d) Within fifteen (15) days following the occurrence of a Change of Ownership
or Control, a notice of occurrence of the Change of Ownership or Control,
describing the resulting Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Right,
shall be delivered to the holders of record of the Series E Preferred Shares
at their addresses as they appear on the Corporations records _(provided
that_ , if the Series E Preferred Shares are held in book-entry form through
DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in the manner permitted by DTC) ****
and notice shall be provided to the Transfer Agent. No failure to give such
notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the
validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any Series E Preferred
Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each
notice, at a minimum, shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of
Ownership or Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Ownership or Control;
(iii) the method and period for calculating the Common Share Price; (iv) the
Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Date; (v) that if, prior to the
Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided
or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of the Series
E Preferred Shares, the holder will not be able to convert shares of Series E
Preferred Shares and such Series E Preferred

 



      
 

 



 

Shares shall be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if they have
already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Ownership or
Control Conversion Right; (vi) if applicable, the type and amount of
Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of
Series E Preferred Shares; (vii) the name and address of the paying agent and
the conversion agent; (viii) any information required by law or by the
applicable rules of any exchange or national securities market upon which the
Series E Preferred Shares may be listed or admitted for trading; and (ix) the
procedures that the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Shares must follow
to exercise the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Right.

 



 

(e) In order to exercise the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Right,
a holder of Series E Preferred Shares shall be required to deliver, on or
before the close of business on the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion
Date, the certificates evidencing the Series E Preferred Shares, to the extent
such shares are certificated, to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer,
together with a written conversion notice completed, to the Transfer Agent.
Such notice shall state: (i) the number of Series E Preferred Shares to be
converted; and (ii) that the Series E Preferred Shares are to be converted
pursuant to the applicable terms of the Series E Preferred Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series E Preferred Shares are held in
global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

 



 

(f) Series E Preferred Shares as to which the Change of Ownership or Control
Conversion Right has been properly exercised shall be converted into the
applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Ownership
or Control Conversion Right on the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion
Date, unless, prior to the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Date, the
Corporation has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem such
Series E Preferred Shares pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of
Section 5\. If the Corporation elects to redeem such Series E Preferred Shares
that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration
on the Change of Ownership or Control Conversion Date, such Series E Preferred
Shares shall not be so converted and the holders of such shares shall be
entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) per share, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions
thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.

 



 

(g) The Corporation shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Change of Ownership or Control
Conversion Date.

 



 

Section 14. _Certain Adjustments_ _._

 



 

(a) _Stock Dividends and Stock Splits_. If the Corporation, at any time while
Series E Preferred Shares are outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend in the
Common Shares with respect to the then-outstanding Common Shares; (ii)
subdivides outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares; or (iii)
combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding Common Shares
into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Price or Share Cap, as
applicable, shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be
the number of Common Shares (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall
be the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event
(excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation).

 



      
 

 



 

Any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 14 shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall
become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision or combination.

 



 

(b) _Fundamental Transaction_. If, at any time while Series E Preferred Shares
are outstanding, (i) the Corporation effects any reorganization by
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person (other
than a merger in which the Corporation is the surviving or continuing entity
and its Common Shares are not exchanged for or converted into other common
equity securities), (ii) any reorganization by tender offer or exchange offer
(whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which
all the Common Shares are exchanged for or converted into other common equity
securities, or (iii) the Corporation effects any reclassification or
compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Shares are converted into other
common equity securities, but in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii) excluding a
Change of Ownership or Control (each such case, a " _Fundamental Transaction_
"), then, upon any subsequent conversion of Series E Preferred Shares the
holders thereof shall have the right to receive, in lieu of the right to
receive Conversion Shares, for each Conversion Share that would have been
issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such
Fundamental Transaction, the same kind and amount of consideration as it would
have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental
Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction,
the holder of one Common Share (the " _Fundamental Transaction Alternate
Consideration_ "). For purposes of any such subsequent conversion, the
conversion calculations shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such
Fundamental Transaction Alternate Consideration based on the amount of
Fundamental Transaction Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one
Common Share in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Corporation shall adjust
the conversion calculations in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Fundamental Transaction Alternate
Consideration. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions,
any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental
Transaction shall file a new certificate of designations with the same terms
and conditions and issue to the holders of Series E Preferred Shares new
preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing such
holders right to convert such preferred stock into Fundamental Transaction
Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement to which the Corporation
is a party and pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall
include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 14 and insuring that Series E
Preferred Shares (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted
upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. The
Corporation shall cause to be delivered to each holder of Series E Preferred
Shares, at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the
Corporation, written notice of any Fundamental Transaction at least twenty
(20) calendar days prior to the date on which such Fundamental Transaction is
expected to become effective or close.

 



 

(c) _Calculations_. All calculations under this Section 14 shall be made to
the nearest cent or the nearest one/one-hundredth (1/100th) of a Common Share,
as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 14, the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be
the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares
of the Corporation) issued and outstanding.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Notice to the Holders of Series E Preferred Shares_. Whenever the
Conversion Price or Share Cap, as applicable, is adjusted pursuant to any
provision of this Section 14, the Corporation shall deliver to each holder of
Series E Preferred Shares a notice setting forth, in reasonable detail, such
adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment.

 



 

Section 15\. _Status of Converted Shares_. All Series E Preferred Shares
issued and converted by the Corporation in accordance with Section 12 and
Section 13 **** above shall be restored to the status of authorized but
unissued shares of undesignated Preferred Stock of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 16\. _Book Entry_. The Series E Preferred Shares shall be issued
initially in the form of one or more fully registered global certificates ("
_Global Preferred Shares_ "), which shall be deposited on behalf of the
purchasers represented thereby with the Transfer Agent, as custodian for a
securities depositary (the " _Depositary_ ") that is a clearing agency under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act (or with such other custodian as the
Depositary may direct), and registered in the name of the Depositary or its
nominee, duly executed by the Corporation and authenticated by the Transfer
Agent. The number of Series E Preferred Shares represented by Global Preferred
Shares may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on
the records of the Transfer Agent and the Depositary as hereinafter provided.
Members of, or participants in, the Depositary (" _Agent Members_ ") shall
have no rights under these terms of the Series E Preferred Shares with respect
to any Global Preferred Shares held on their behalf by the Depositary or by
the Transfer Agent as the custodian of the Depositary or under such Global
Preferred Shares, and the Depositary may be treated by the Corporation, the
Transfer Agent and any agent of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent as the
absolute owner of such Global Preferred Shares for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Corporation,
the Transfer Agent or any agent of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent from
giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent
Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depositary governing the
exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global
Preferred Shares.

 



 

Section 17\. _Fractional Shares_. The Series E Preferred Shares may be issued
in fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder thereof, in proportion
to such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, exercise
conversion rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions, and to
have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series E Preferred Shares.
