interest that may arise in connection with GT representing one or more of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates after the Closing in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, based on the fact that GT may be
deemed to have represented the Company prior to the Closing or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, subject to the last sentence of this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.19(a)</U> and except in the case of any matter
as between the Company, on the one hand, and any Person other than any Seller or any of their respective its Affiliates, on the other hand, (i)&nbsp;all communications involving attorney-client confidences between any Seller, its Affiliates or the
Company and GT for the purpose of negotiating, documenting and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Company), (ii) the Company shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of GT primarily relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred; and (iii)&nbsp;upon and after the Closing, (A)&nbsp;the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and the Company shall not be a holder thereof, (B)&nbsp;to the extent that files of GT in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall hold such property rights and (C)&nbsp;GT shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between GT and the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding, anything herein to the contrary, it is understood that communications, status updates and advice prior to
the Closing with the Company regarding legal matters involving the Company not made for the primary purpose of the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement (and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the other agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith) shall remain the property of the Company from and after Closing. </P>
