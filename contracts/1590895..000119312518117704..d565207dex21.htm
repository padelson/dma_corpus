hereof.

WHEREAS, each Seller owns, beneficially and of record one half of the
outstanding partnership interests of the Company, collectively constituting
100% of the outstanding partnership interests of the Company (such ownership

WHEREAS, the Company owns and operates the Grand Victoria Casino Elgin and

(the " _Property_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase from the Sellers, and the

and subject to the conditions contained herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of
the mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF PURCHASED INTERESTS

 

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Purchased Interests_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Buyer shall cause the Buyer Purchasing Subsidiaries to purchase the Purchased
Interests from the Sellers in such proportions as shall be designated in
writing by the Buyer, and each Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver to
such Buyer Purchasing Subsidiaries the Purchased Interests owned by such
Seller. The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Interests (the "
_Purchase Price_ "), shall be an amount equal to (a) three hundred twenty
seven million five hundred thousand Dollars ($327,500,000), _plus_ (b) the
Cash Amount, _plus_ (c) the amount (if any) by which the Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, _plus_ (d) the Deferred
Compensation Asset, _minus_ (e) the amount (if any) by which the Target
Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital, _minus_ (f) an amount
equal to 50% of the RandW Insurance Policy Premium, _minus_ (g) the
Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ (h) the Accrued Donation Amount, _minus_ (i) the
Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount, _minus_ (j) the Deferred Compensation Liability.
Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) the Purchase Price and the
other payments contemplated hereby as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and
subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6_. Section 1.2 _Deposit_. No later than one (1) Business Day following the
date hereof, the Buyer shall deposit fifteen million Dollars ($15,000,000)
(such amount, the " _Deposit_ ") with Citibank, National Association (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to an escrow agreement dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_ ") executed and delivered by the
Sellers, the Buyer and the Escrow Agent. Upon the Closing, (i) the Escrow
Agent shall release an amount equal to one-half of the Deposit to each
Seller, and such aggregate amount shall be credited against the Purchase Price
payable to the Sellers, and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall release the interest
accrued on the Deposit, if any, to the Buyer. Upon the termination of this
Agreement, the Deposit and the interest accrued thereon (if any) shall be
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ hereof, and thereafter shall be
promptly released by the Escrow Agent to the Buyer or the Sellers,
as applicable, pursuant to such _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ hereof and the terms
of the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 1.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price (as determined
for federal income tax purposes, including any liabilities of the Company
that are required to be treated as part of the Purchase Price for federal
income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in
accordance with Sections 1060 and 755 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law). The Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers within
sixty (60) Business Days after the Closing Date a purchase price allocation
(the " _Proposed Allocation_ "). The Buyer shall promptly provide to the
Sellers such backup or supporting data (including appraisals to the extent
available) relating to the preparation of the Proposed Allocation as the
Sellers may reasonably request. The Sellers shall accept and agree to the
Proposed Allocation unless any one or more of the Sellers, acting in good
faith, object to the Proposed Allocation, in which case such Seller or Sellers
(as the case may be) shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt
of the Proposed Allocation and requested supporting documentation, deliver
written notice to the Buyer of such objection. Such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the items in the Proposed Allocation to which the Seller or
Sellers object and the basis for such objection. Following delivery of such
notice, the Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to reach a
mutually acceptable agreement regarding such disputed items. In the event
that the parties cannot mutually agree upon a resolution with respect to such
disputed items within thirty (30) Business Days of the Buyers receipt of such
notice, then each Seller and the Buyer shall each be entitled to determine
the allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company in any
manner each Seller or the Buyer, respectively, may determine in its sole
discretion, and each Seller and the Buyer shall have no liability to the other
with respect to such determination or allocation. In the event that the
parties mutually agree upon a Proposed Allocation, the Buyer Parties and the
Sellers agree to (a) be bound by the purchase price allocation established in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_
"), (b) act in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation in the filing of
all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) and in the course of any Tax
audit, Tax examination or Tax litigation relating thereto, and (c) take no
position and cause their Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation for Tax purposes, in the case of each of clauses (a)
through (c) unless otherwise required by a change in applicable Law or
pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax contest. The Sellers and the
Buyer shall make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation to
reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price.

terminated pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VII_ hereof, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the purchase and sale
of the Purchased Interests (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place no
later than 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on the fifth (5th) Business Day following
satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_

Amount and Estimated Deferred Compensation Liability, including the

documentation regarding the calculation of Estimated Cash Amount, Estimated
Closing Working Capital, Estimated Deferred Compensation Asset, Estimated
Indebtedness Amount, Estimated Accrued Donation Amount, Estimated Accrued
Gaming Taxes Amount and Estimated Deferred Compensation Liability, and based

Price. The Buyer and its Representatives will be entitled to reasonable
access during normal business hours to the relevant records, personnel and
working papers of the Company to aid in its review of the Estimated Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Cash Amount, Estimated Closing
Working Capital, Estimated Deferred Compensation Asset, Estimated
Indebtedness Amount, Estimated Accrued Donation Amount, Estimated Accrued
Gaming Taxes Amount, Estimated Deferred Compensation Liability and Estimated

5 (b) At the Transfer Time, the Buyer shall conduct (or cause to be conducted) a
cash count and the drop for one hundred percent (100%) of the Companys
gaming device "drop boxes" as well as a count of the Companys liability for
all outstanding chips, tokens, tickets and similar cash equivalents ("
_Company Chips_ "). A Representative of Sellers may be present to observe
such cash count, drop box count, and Company Chips liability count if it so
elects. Such cash count, drop box count, and Company Chips count shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer, absent manifest error,
and shall be used in the preparation of Closing Working Capital that is
contained in the Post-Closing Statement (it being understood that the
aggregate value of all outstanding Company Chips will constitute a current
liability of the Company in connection with the calculation of Closing Working
Capital). Within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall provide Sellers a list of all outstanding Company Chips in sufficient
detail for Sellers to determine the type, number, and denomination of the
Company Chips.

(c) No more than one hundred (100) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
will prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to the Sellers a statement
showing the Buyers calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital,
Deferred Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness Amount, the Accrued Donation
Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount and Deferred Compensation Liability,
including the calculation thereof in reasonable detail calculated pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and based on such calculations, the Buyers
calculation of the Purchase Price (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ "). The
Buyer shall promptly provide to the Sellers such backup or supporting data
relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation
of the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital, Deferred Compensation Asset, the
Indebtedness Amount, the Accrued Donation Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes
Amount, Deferred Compensation Liability and the Purchase Price reflected
thereon as the Sellers may reasonably request. The Buyer shall also provide
the Sellers and their respective Representatives with such reasonable access
to the books, records and personnel of the Company, at reasonable times and
upon reasonable notice, as the Sellers may request for the purposes of
evaluating the Post-Closing Statement and the Buyers calculation of the Cash
Amount, Closing Working Capital, Deferred Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness
Amount, the Accrued Donation Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount,
Deferred Compensation Liability and the Purchase Price.

(d) The Sellers shall, within the thirty (30) day period following receipt of
such Post-Closing Statement (the " _Acceptance Period_ "), notify the Buyer of
their acceptance or non-acceptance (as the case may be) of the Post-Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital,
Deferred Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness Amount, the Accrued Donation
Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount, Deferred Compensation Liability and
the Purchase Price reflected thereon. If no such notice is delivered to the
Buyer by the Sellers within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing Statement
and the calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital, Deferred
Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness Amount, the Accrued Donation Amount, the
Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount, Deferred Compensation Liability and the Purchase
Price reflected thereon shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers
and shall be binding on all parties for all purposes of this Agreement. If
the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing
Working Capital, Deferred Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness Amount, the
Accrued Donation Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount, Deferred
Compensation Liability and the Purchase Price reflected thereon are accepted
or deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers, then payment of any related
amounts,

 



6  as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_, shall be made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(f)_. If the Sellers give notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
to the Buyer within the Acceptance Period that the Sellers do not agree with
or otherwise do not accept the calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing Working
Capital, Deferred Compensation Asset, the Indebtedness Amount, the
Accrued Donation Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes Amount, Deferred
Compensation Liability and the Purchase Price reflected on the Post-Closing
Statement, the Sellers shall describe in such Dispute Notice the nature of any
disagreement so asserted. The Buyer and the Sellers shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve all such disagreements within the thirty (30) day period (the
" _Negotiating Period_ ") following the delivery by the Sellers of such
Dispute Notice.

 

(e) If the parties are able to resolve all disputed amounts, the Post-Closing
Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the final Post-
Closing Statement and shall be binding on all parties for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to resolve any
disagreements regarding the Post-Closing Statement and the calculations
reflected thereon within the Negotiating Period, then within fifteen (15)
days after the end of the Negotiating Period all such disputes shall be
referred to KPMG US LLP or, if such firm declines to serve, then such other
nationally recognized independent accounting firm as is mutually acceptable
to the Buyer and the Sellers (the " _Neutral Accounting Firm_ "). The Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be instructed only to resolve all outstanding
disagreements relating to the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital, Deferred Compensation Asset, the
Indebtedness Amount, the Accrued Donation Amount, the Accrued Gaming Taxes
Amount, Deferred Compensation Liability and the Purchase Price reflected
thereon, and shall be instructed not to otherwise investigate such matters
independently or introduce different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies
in connection therewith. If the Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree upon an
accounting firm to serve as the Neutral Accounting Firm within such 15-day
period, then the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be an accountant employed by
an accounting firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration
Association in New York, New York (which shall not be the independent auditor
of either Buyer or Sellers or their respective Affiliates). The Neutral
Accounting Firm shall consider only those amounts that the Sellers and Buyer
have been unable to resolve. Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall execute and
deliver a customary engagement letter as may be reasonably requested by the
Neutral Accounting Firm. The Sellers and Buyer shall instruct the Neutral
Accounting Firm that, within five (5) Business Days following its acceptance
of its appointment as the Neutral Accounting Firm, it shall deliver to the
Sellers and Buyer a written notice (the " _Accountant Notice_ ") setting
forth (i) the deadline for Sellers and Buyers submission of the written
presentations setting forth their respective positions with respect to the
disputed amounts (which deadline shall in all events be (A) the same for the
Sellers and Buyer and (B) no sooner than thirty (30) days following the date
of delivery of the Accountant Notice (unless otherwise mutually agreed in
writing among the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Sellers and Buyer) and no
later than forty-five (45) days following the date of the Accountant Notice)
and (ii) the format in which the Sellers and Buyer are to submit their written
presentations (which format shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and
Buyer). A copy of all materials submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be provided by the
Sellers and Buyer, as applicable, no later than the deadline set forth in the
Accountant Notice (as the same may be amended by the mutual written consent of
the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Sellers and Buyer), and a copy of such
materials shall be provided to the other party hereto concurrently with the
submission thereof to the Neutral Accounting Firm.

 



7  The Sellers and Buyer shall instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm to
promptly, but no later than sixty (60) days after its appointment, determine
(based solely on the written presentations of the Sellers and Buyer timely
delivered to the Neutral Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 1.6(e)_ and in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute
and to render a written report as to the calculations of the disputed amounts,
which report, absent manifest error, shall thereupon be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto for all purposes hereunder. The Neutral Accounting
Firm may not assign a value to any disputed amount greater than the greatest
value for such disputed amount claimed by Buyer or the Sellers or less than
the smallest value for such disputed amount claimed by Buyer or the
Sellers. Upon the decision of the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Post-Closing
Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the Neutral
Accounting Firms decision, shall be the final Post-Closing Statement. The
fees, costs, and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Sellers and Buyer based on the inverse of the percentage that the Neutral
Accounting Firms determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Neutral
Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to
$1,000 and the Neutral Accounting Firm award $600 in favor of the Sellers
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of
the costs would be borne by the Sellers.

(f) Promptly following the final resolution of all disputes, if any, relating
to the Post-Closing Statement calculations and amounts reflected thereon in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days thereafter, (A) Buyer shall pay (or cause the Buyer Purchasing
Subsidiaries to pay) to each Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as may be designated by the Sellers to the
Buyer in writing, an amount equal to one-half of the amount (if any) by which
the Retention Bonus Amount exceeds the Retention Bonus Payments as of such
time and (B) (i) if the finally determined Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Purchase Price (such amount, the " _Actual Surplus_ "), then the
Buyer shall pay (or cause the Buyer Purchasing Subsidiaries to pay) to each
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as may be designated by the Sellers to the Buyer in writing, an
amount equal to one-half of such Actual Surplus, or (ii) if the finally
determined Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (such
amount, the " _Actual Deficiency_ "), then each Seller shall severally pay to
the Buyer an amount equal to the product of (i) such Actual Deficiency and
(ii) 0.5 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as may be designated by Buyer to the Sellers in writing; _provided_
, that with respect to the amount of Actual Deficiency to be paid to Buyer by
RBG, unless RBG elects to pay such amount owed as contemplated above, RBG and
Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction
instructing the Escrow Agent to release such amounts owed from the RBG Escrow
Fund.

 

Section 1.7 _Withholding_. The Buyer Parties and the Company shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the amounts payable under this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any
other applicable Tax Laws; _provided_ , that Buyer Parties or the Company, as
applicable, shall provide written notice of any intent to so deduct and
withhold any amount to each Seller with respect to which such deduction or
withholding may be made at least five (5) Business Days prior to making such
deduction or withholding (unless such requirement to deduct or withhold any
amount is pursuant to a change in Law or fact that occurs within five (5)
Business Days of the applicable payment, in which case the

 



8  Buyer Parties or the Company, as applicable, shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide written notice of any intent to so deduct and withhold any
amount to each Seller with respect to which such deduction or withholding may
be made prior to the time of such payment) and shall work with the applicable
Seller(s) to reduce or eliminate such requirement to deduct and withhold such
amount. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Buyer
Parties or the Company, such deducted and withheld amounts (a) shall be
remitted by the Buyer Parties or the Company to the applicable Governmental
Entity within the time and in the manner required by applicable Law and (b)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

precedent to the Closing in favor of the Buyer Parties that any of the Buyer
Parties have obtained any financing.

 

Section 4.5 _Licensability_. None of the Buyer Parties, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, managers, members, key

for such Buyer Permits,

 



25  the failure of which to hold would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to materially impair or materially delay the Closing, and no
event has occurred that permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of
time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any Buyer Permit that currently is in effect,
other than such Buyer Permits the revocation, non-renewal, modification,
suspension, limitation or termination of which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to materially impair or
materially delay the Closing. The Buyer Parties, and to the knowledge of the
Buyer, each of the Licensed Parties, is in compliance with the terms of the
Buyer Permits, except for such failures to comply that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to materially impair or materially
delay the Closing. No Buyer Party has received notice of any investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity under any Gaming Law with respect to such
Buyer Party or any of its Licensing Affiliates that is pending, and to the

Laws other than as would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to materially impair or materially delay the Closing. To the
knowledge of the Buyer, there are no facts that if known to the Gaming
Authorities could, under the Gaming Laws, reasonably be likely to result in
the denial, termination, suspension, limitation or revocation of any Buyer
Permit or any other material license, finding of suitability, registration,
permit or approval of the Licensed Parties.

 

Section 4.7 _Litigation_. There are no actions, claims, suits or legal,
administrative or arbitratorial proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Buyer, threatened against the Buyer Parties before any Governmental
Entity, nor are any of the Buyer Parties subject to any judgment, order or
decree of any court or Governmental Entity that would, if determined
adversely, be reasonably likely to (a) materially and adversely affect any
Buyer Partys performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) seek to prevent or
materially delay or burden any of the transactions contemplated by this

(a) After the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
and the Company shall timely file (or cause to be filed) all income Tax

period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Company for its taxable year ending

adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect to U.S. federal income
Taxes and applicable state and local income Taxes of the Company for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers agree to file
amended Tax Returns (or comply with alternative "pull-in" procedures) as
provided under Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code (or any similar provision of
state or local law) taking into account all adjustments allocated to each
Seller as proposed by the IRS (or, for the avoidance of doubt, as otherwise
allocated by the Company, if not so allocated by the IRS), and to pay the
amount of any Tax (including any interest and penalties thereon) due with
respect to such amended Tax Returns (or that would be due if such amended Tax
Returns were filed) in such a manner and in such amount that the amount of any
"imputed underpayment" of the Company, within the meaning of Section
6225(a)(1) of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local law), is
reduced to zero. The Buyer Parties, the Company and the Sellers shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include providing the partnership
representative with a copy of any notice or other documentation relating to
any such audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to income Taxes
for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date, the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided pursuant hereto. The Buyer Parties, the Company and the
Sellers agree to retain all books and records within their possession
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and to the extent of any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, to make any such books and records available to any other
affected party prior to disposing of them and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority.

after the Closing Date, Company shall not be obligated to make any
payment pursuant to any such agreement for any past or future period.

completed with respect to the Property, and (ii) the Company receives
any insurance proceeds from such casualty or governmental award in such
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding (in either case, " _Casualty and
Condemnation Proceeds_ "), then the Company may not distribute such Casualty
and Condemnation Proceeds to Sellers.

(b) In the event that, during the period from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
or the Closing, (i) there is any damage, destruction or other casualty

award) to the Company prior to the Closing, and (B) if Sellers receive the
Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds after the Closing, Sellers shall promptly
deliver such proceeds (net of legal expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with pursuing the proceeds or award) to the Company.

_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, the Buyer shall have the right to participate in any
settlements and related discussions with the applicable insurance company, and
Sellers shall take into consideration the Buyers requests with respect
thereto as part of its negotiations with the applicable insurance company. In
addition, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall

reasonably be expected to result in Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds
exceeding $100,000 individually.

Insurance Policy to remain in full force and effect following the issuance
thereof, including paying when due all premiums, fees, costs and taxes payable
thereunder and satisfying on a timely basis all conditions necessary for the
continuance of coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy. The Buyer Parties
shall not terminate, cancel, amend, waive or otherwise modify the RandW Binder,
RandW Insurance Policy or any of the coverage thereunder prior to, at or at any
time after the Closing in a manner that would increase the Liability of the
Sellers under this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers hereby agree
to cooperate with the Buyer Parties by exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the Buyer Parties may reasonably request related
to obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy and the issuance thereof, including
providing such diligence information as shall be requested by the Buyer
Parties in connection therewith, and making personnel of the Company
reasonably available to participate in diligence calls.

Section 5.17 _Donation Agreements_. The Buyer Parties agree and acknowledge
that the Purchase Price was based on the results of operations of the Company
after taking into account the historical, current and future payment
obligations of the Company under each of the Donation Agreements. The Buyer
Parties shall, and shall cause the Company and the GV Foundation (as
applicable) to, maintain the Donation Agreements in full force and effect for
a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, unless prohibited by the
Illinois Gaming Board or otherwise instructed or ordered by the Illinois
Gaming Board from time to time, including: (a) complying in all material

modify or terminate any of the Donation Agreements or waive any material
rights thereunder (or seek any approvals, authorizations, waivers, exemptions
or the like from any Governmental Entity (including a Gaming Authority) for
any such amendment, modification, termination or waiver). The Buyer Parties
acknowledge that the Sellers have relied on the covenants and agreement
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ in connection with entering into this
Agreement and that this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ is intended for the benefit of,
and to grant third party rights to, each of MGM and each of the members of RBG

be enforced only by one or more members (on behalf of all members)
collectively holding more than 30% of the percentage interests of RBG as of
the date hereof.

Parties shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) the proceeds therefrom (less

(Accredited Investor), and _4.11_ (RandW Insurance Policy) shall survive until
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, and the representations and
warranties in  _Section_ __ _ 2.15_ (to the extent related to ERISA or the
Code, or plans subject to ERISA) shall survive until sixty (60) days following
the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into account any
extensions or waivers thereof) applicable to the collection of the applicable
Tax that is the subject of such representations. The period of time a
representation or warranty survives the Closing pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be the " _Survival Period_ " with respect to such
representation or warranty. The parties intend for the preceding two sentences
to alter the otherwise applicable statute of limitations and agree that,
subject to the last sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_, no claim may
be brought based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement after the Survival Period with respect
to such representation or warranty. The covenants and agreements of the
parties hereto in this Agreement to be performed prior to or at the Closing
shall terminate at Closing. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
in this Agreement to be performed 

 



45  following the Closing shall survive the Closing without any contractual
limitation on the period of survival (other than those covenants and
agreements that are expressly required to remain in full force and effect for
a specified period of time). The termination of the representations and
warranties provided herein shall not affect a party (i) in respect of any
claim made by such party in reasonable detail in writing received by
an Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival
Period provided herein, or (ii) in respect of any claim grounded in common law
fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of the Indemnifying
Party set forth in _Article II_ and _Article III_ , or _Article IV_ of this
Agreement (as applicable).

Section 8.2  _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, each Seller shall, severally and not jointly
and severally in accordance with such Sellers applicable Pro Rata Share,
indemnify, save and hold harmless the Buyer, the Buyer Purchasing Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, successors and assigns
(each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all costs, losses, Taxes,
Liabilities, obligations, damages, claims, demands and expenses (whether or
not arising out of third-party claims), including interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys fees and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or
settlement of any of the foregoing (herein, " _Damages_ "), incurred in
connection with, arising out of, or resulting from:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller or the
Company in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Sections 6.2(a)_ , ( _b)_ or _(c)_ hereof;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by
such Seller or the Company in this Agreement following the Closing; and

(iii) all income Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company (or any
predecessor thereof) (A) for or attributable to any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date and (B) for or attributable to the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (and any allocation of income
Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books
and records of the Company as of the end of the Closing Date); _provided_ ,
that to the extent the facts and circumstances giving rise to a claim for
indemnification pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(iii)_ would also give
rise to a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy, the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party shall also make a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 8.5(g)_ below.

(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify, save and hold
harmless Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives,
successors and assigns (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of, or resulting from:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by any Buyer Party in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ hereof; and

 



46 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by
any Buyer Party in this Agreement following the Closing.

(c) _Interpretation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the term Damages shall not include any exemplary or punitive or
similar damages, except where such damages are recovered from an Indemnified
Party by a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly
understood and agreed that nothing contained in the foregoing sentence shall
limit, alter, or waive in any manner or respect any defenses available to any
Person or any burdens of proof or legal standards required to be met by any
Person under applicable Law. For purposes of determining (i) whether a breach
or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty has occurred and (ii) the dollar
amount of Damages with respect to any claim resulting from any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, all "material", "materiality",
"in all material respects", or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or
exceptions in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the representations and
warranties contained in the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ (Financial
Statements), _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (Agreements, Contracts and Commitments)
and  _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ (No Undisclosed Liabilities) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not apply to, or otherwise affect, the definitions
of "Material Contracts" and "Material Adverse Effect".

 

Section 8.3 _Procedure for Claims between Parties_. If a claim for Damages is
to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice
describing the claim in reasonable detail and, to the extent then
ascertainable, the monetary damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to the
indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively,
the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable after such
Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which may give
rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this  _Article_
__ _ VIII_. Any failure to submit any such Notice to the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure.

Section 8.4 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, claim or enforcement
action is initiated against an Indemnified Party by any third party (each, a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification under this _Article_ __ _
VIII_ may be sought, Notice thereof, together with copies of all notices and
communication relating to such Third Party Claim, shall be given to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as reasonably practicable. The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If it so elects at its own cost, risk and expense, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to:

(i) take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim at
its sole cost and expense if the Indemnifying Party so notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing;

 



47 (ii) employ and engage attorneys of its own choice ( _provided_ that
such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) to handle
and defend the same, unless the named parties to such action or proceeding
include both one or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and
the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded that there may be one or more
legal defenses or defense strategies available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to an applicable
Indemnifying Party or that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest, in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate
counsel ( _provided_ that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party); and

(iii) compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, which compromise
or settlement shall be made (x) with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, without any cost, liability
or admission of wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such Indemnified
Party, and provides only for monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party. 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, participate in
the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal
arising therefrom. The parties shall cooperate with each other in any
notifications to insurers.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Notice, the
Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will
have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable cost,
risk and expense (but only to the extent that it is finally determined that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article VIII_ ), the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Parties (but only to the extent that it is finally determined
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , __
that such Third Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(e) If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of
the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

 

(f) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim within sixty (60) days of the Notice of such Third Party
Claim having been provided to the Indemnifying Party, the Damages arising
from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
Damages to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination
thereof.

 



48 Section 8.5 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

 

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to, indemnification
from any of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_
hereof (other than with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of a Seller
Fundamental Representation) except to the extent the aggregate claims for
Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for which indemnification is sought
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof exceed $1,637,500 (the "
_Deductible_ "), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to recover, subject to the other limitations in this _Article VIII_ , only to
the extent such Damages in the aggregate exceed the Deductible.

(b) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied herein to the contrary,
other than as specifically set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(i)_ or in the case
of common law fraud by Sellers in the making of such representations and
warranties contained in  _Article II_ and _Article III_ , the Closing Escrow
Funds shall be the sole and exclusive source for the satisfaction of any
Damages indemnifiable by Sellers under and pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(i)_, and once such funds have been exhausted or released, (i) Sellers
shall have no direct or indirect liability with respect to, and no obligation
to satisfy, any claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(i)_ and (ii) the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties in respect of any such Damages shall be limited to the RandW Insurance
Policy. Sellers shall have no direct or indirect liability of any kind or
nature with respect to the RandW Insurance Policy or any claim thereunder
(including by way of subrogation) other than in the case of common law fraud
by Sellers in the making of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article II_ and _Article III_.

 

(c) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under _Section_ __ _
8.2 _unless a claim has been asserted by written notice, specifying the
details of the alleged breach with reasonable particularity, the sections of
this Agreement alleged to have been breached, a good faith estimate of the
Damages claimed, and all the relevant facts with respect thereto, delivered
to the Sellers or the Buyer Parties (as the case may be) on or prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period (in which case the applicable
survival period shall be deemed to extend until such claim has been finally
resolved). 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to the other limitations contained herein), (x) in no event shall any
Sellers aggregate liability for all indemnifiable claims for Damages pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ exceed the aggregate Purchase Price received by
such Seller and (y) the limitations contained in this _Article VIII_ shall
not prevent the Buyer Indemnified Parties from filing a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy or otherwise apply to claims made by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(e) No Seller shall be liable for Damages with respect to the representations
and warranties contained in _Article III_ to the extent that such
representations and warranties relate to another Seller, nor shall any Seller
have any liability for the failure of another Seller to perform any of the
obligations, covenants or agreements to be performed or complied with by such
other 

 



49  Seller, it being agreed and understood that all of such representations,
warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements are being made individually
by each Seller, and not jointly and severally by all Sellers. The aggregate
liability of any Seller for Damages with respect to any indemnification claim
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder shall not exceed such Sellers
Individual Portion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller shall, subject to
the other limitations set forth herein, be responsible for 100% of the Damages
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of a breach by such
Seller of any of its representations and warranties set forth in  _Article
III_ or the covenants of such Seller set forth herein, without regard to such
Sellers Individual Portion.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Seller shall be liable under this _Article VIII_ for any Damages or alleged
Damages to the extent such Damages or alleged Damages are taken into account
in the calculation of the Cash Amount, Closing Working Capital, Deferred
Compensation Asset, Indebtedness Amount, Accrued Donation Amount, Accrued
Gaming Taxes Amount or Deferred Compensation Liability (including any
component of any of the foregoing). Notwithstanding anything expressed or
implied herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification with respect to any Taxes for any taxable period, or
portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date, except with respect to a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_
or _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)_.

 

(g) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i)
shall not be duplicative of any other Damages for which an indemnification
claim has been paid and (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually
recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy (including
the RandW Insurance Policy and the Title Policy) with respect to such Damages
(net of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such
insurance proceeds). Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover from any applicable insurance policy (including the RandW
Insurance Policy and the Title Policy) in respect of any Damages that are the
subject of indemnification under this _Article VIII_. If an Indemnified Party
actually recovers an amount from an insurance policy in respect of Damages
that are the subject of indemnification under this _Article VIII_ after all or
a portion of such Damages have been paid by or at the direction of the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Party
shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the
amount paid by or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Damages, plus the amount received from the insurance policy in respect
thereof, less (ii) the full amount of such Damages, plus the amount of
any out-of-pocket costs, fees or expenses incurred to procure such proceeds
and the amount of any increased insurance premiums, retentions or other out-
of-pocket costs related to or arising therefrom.

(h) Nothing herein shall waive any partys common law duty to mitigate any
such claim or liability upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that
are indemnifiable under this  _Article VIII_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of
any Damages described in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ for a breach or
inaccuracy of a Seller Fundamental Representation (" _Specified Damages_ "),
(1) the Buyer Parties agree to, and agree to cause each other Buyer
Indemnified Party to, make a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy in respect
of

 



50  such Specified Damages and use commercially reasonable efforts to recover
such Specified Damages under the RandW Insurance Policy up to the Policy Limit
and (2) to the extent that a Buyer Indemnified Party may not recover, or has
not recovered, all of such Specified Damages pursuant to clause (1) above
because such Specified Damages are subject to a retention (as may be eroded or
dropped down from time to time) under the RandW Insurance Policy (the amount of
such Specified Damages subject to such retention being the " _Retention
Amount_ "), are in excess of the Policy Limit (the amount by which such
Specified Damages exceed the Policy Limit being the " _Excess Amount_ ") or
are otherwise not covered by, or recoverable under, the RandW Insurance Policy,
the Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including, with
respect to amounts attributable to RBG, by recovery from the RBG Escrow Fund)
for such Specified Damages under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_, but only to the
extent of the Retention Amount or Excess Amount (as the case may be).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover any Damages from any Seller if such Damages would have
been covered under the RandW Insurance Policy if not for a failure by a Buyer
Indemnified Party to properly make a claim thereunder (or otherwise comply
with the terms thereof). The parties agree and acknowledge that any other
limitations contained in this _Article VIII_ with respect to insurance
policies and recovery thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(i)_.

Section 8.6 _Payment of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash
by an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become
entitled by reason of the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VIII_, within ten
(10) Business Days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement
of the Buyer and the Sellers (or a Seller, as applicable) or on the date on
which both such amount and an Indemnified Partys obligation to pay such
amount have been determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court or
administrative body having jurisdiction over such proceeding. Within three (3)
Business Days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, if there is any
amount of cash remaining in the Closing Escrow Fund (other than amounts
relating to claims for which a Notice has been delivered and that have not
been finally resolved and paid prior to such expiration date) (such remaining
amount, the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ "), the Buyer and the Sellers shall
deliver a written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release the Remaining Escrow Amount from the Closing Escrow Fund and to pay
the Remaining Escrow Amount to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated by the
Sellers to the Escrow Agent in writing.

 

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, except in the case of
common law fraud by Sellers or the Buyer Parties in the making of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article II_ and _Article III_ or
_Article IV_ (as the case may be), the indemnities provided in this _Article_
__ _ VIII_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified
Party arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims
regarding matters arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
exclusive remedy does not preclude a party from bringing an action for
specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to enforce any decision
or determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Buyer Parties and Sellers each hereby waive (and, by their
acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party
and Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives), from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other

 



51  than claims of, or causes of action arising from, common law fraud by
Sellers or the Buyer Parties in the making of the representations and
warranties contained in _Article II_ and  _Article III_ or _Article IV_ (as
the case may be)) such party may have against the other party arising under or
based upon this Agreement or any schedule, exhibit, disclosure letter,
document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, and no legal action
sounding in tort, statute or strict liability may be maintained by any party
(other than a legal action brought solely to enforce or pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VIII_). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
8.7_ shall prevent any Buyer Indemnified Party from seeking recovery, or
recovering, under the RandW Insurance Policy or Title Policy in accordance with
their respective terms.

 

Section 8.8 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer Parties and the
Company (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ ") each hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges each
Seller Party and each of their respective successors and assigns, and any
present or former direct and indirect investors, partners, shareholders,
equity holders, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, lenders,
principals, members or managers of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a "
_Released Party_ "), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants,
liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of action,
obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever,
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or indirect,
at law or in equity (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ ") that such
Releasing Party ever had, now has or ever may have or claim to have against
any Released Party, arising in connection with the management, ownership and
operation of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that this release does not
extend to claims relating to any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or
any of the provisions set forth herein or release or waive any rights to be
indemnified, reimbursed and held harmless that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
are entitled to under this _Article VIII_. Each Buyer Party, on behalf of
itself and the Buyer Indemnified Parties and other Releasing Parties,
expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which limits the effect of
a release with respect to unknown claims. Each Buyer Party, on behalf of
itself and the Buyer Indemnified Parties and other Releasing Parties,
covenants that none of the Releasing Parties will (and that such Buyer Party
will cause all other Persons who may seek to claim as, by, through or in
relation to any of the Releasing Parties or any of the matters released by or
on behalf of the Releasing Parties in this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ not to) sue
any of the Released Parties on the basis of any of the Released Claims herein
released and discharged. Each Buyer Party, on behalf of itself and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and other Releasing Parties, understands the significance
of this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory protection against a
release of unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an
essential and material term of this Agreement. The Buyer Parties acknowledge
that the Sellers will be relying on the waiver and release provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.8_ in connection with entering into this Agreement and that
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third
party rights to, each Released Party (including each Seller Party) to enforce
this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ shall
prevent any Buyer Parties from seeking recovery, or recovering, under the RandW
Insurance Policy in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 8.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by Law, any amounts payable under this _Article VIII_ shall be
treated by the Buyer and the Sellers as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 9.5 _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement (i) when a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such
reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference, (ii) the table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement, (iii)
whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," (iv) the word "or" is not exclusive and (v) the words "herein",
"hereof", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a
whole. The Buyer and each Seller will be referred to herein individually as a
"party" and collectively as "parties" (except where the context
otherwise requires). The words "provided", "delivered", "made available" or
other terms of like meaning shall mean that the referenced document or other
material was (a) posted and accessible to a Buyer Party or
its Representatives in the Citrix ShareFile data room created for Elgin
Riverboat Diligence at least one (1) Business Day prior to, and remained so
posted and accessible through, the date of this Agreement or (b) transmitted
to any of the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Representatives by any
other electronic means. The term "pending" shall mean pending (but shall not
be construed as referring to any action, suit or proceeding against an
applicable party that has been filed but not yet served such party). The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in

 



67  any Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or
higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items, (i) are or
are not material, (ii) do or do not constitute a Material Adverse Effect or
(iii) are or are not outside the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or
matter not described herein or included in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not
material, does or does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect or is or is
not outside the Ordinary Course of Business, in each case, for purposes of
this Agreement.

Section 9.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and all documents and
instruments referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect after the
Closing. Each party hereto hereby agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement, the certificates and other
agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement and the respective
Disclosure Schedules, neither the Sellers nor the Buyer Parties make any other
representations or warranties, and each hereby disclaims any other
representations and warranties made by itself or any of its respective
Representatives or other Representatives, with respect to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any of them or their
respective Representatives of any documentation or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

Section 9.8  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Without the prior written consent of all of the
parties hereto, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law (including by
merger or consolidation) or otherwise. Any attempted assignment in violation
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ shall be void.

 

Section 9.10 _Parties of Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto and its permitted successors and assigns, and, except for the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the Seller Indemnified Parties and as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



68 Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or
PDF file (portable document format file) shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event any ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended other than by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Buyer and the Sellers.

Section 9.14  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, may, to the extent
legally allowed (i) extend the time for or waive the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant herein and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay on
the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
any other right.

Section 9.15 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to
this Agreement and all the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions
herein.

Section 9.16 _Guarantee_. MGM hereby, irrevocably and unconditionally, as
primary obligor and not merely as surety, guarantees to the Buyer the payment
and performance by MGM Elgins obligations under _Section_ __ _ 1.6(f)_ and
_Article VIII_.

 

Section 9.17 _Waiver of Restrictions under Partnership Agreement_. The
Sellers, being the partners of the Company, and the Company, hereby agree
that, notwithstanding anything in the Partnership Agreement to the contrary,
the transfer of the Purchased Interests hereunder and other transactions
referenced herein shall be made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and that no conditions, restrictions or other provisions related
to or applicable to transfer of the Purchased Interests contained in the
Partnership Agreement shall be applicable to, or be implicated by, such
transfer, and that any such conditions, restrictions or other provisions are
hereby fully and completely waived in all respect, and the transfer of the
Purchased Interests and other transactions referenced herein pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement is hereby ratified or approved in all respects.

 



69 Section 9.18 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as
parties hereunder, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), no past, present or
future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of any party
hereto shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity
party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities of
any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.18_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and enforceable by, the directors, managers, officers,
employees, incorporators, committee members, members, partners, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys and other representatives of the parties hereto,
and each such Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __
_ 9.18_.

Section 9.19 _Conflict Waiver; Transaction Materials_.

 

(a) Recognizing that Greenberg Traurig, LLP or one or more of its affiliated
or related entities (" _GT_ ") has acted as legal counsel to the Company
prior to the Closing, and that GT has acted and intends to act as legal
counsel to one or more Sellers or their respective Affiliates after the
Closing, each of the Buyer Parties and the Company hereby waives any conflicts
of interest that may arise in connection with GT representing one or more of
the Sellers or their respective Affiliates after the Closing in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, based on the
fact that GT may be deemed to have represented the Company prior to the
Closing or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. In
addition, subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.19(a)_ and
except in the case of any matter as between the Company, on the one hand, and
any Person other than any Seller or any of their respective its Affiliates, on
the other hand, (i) all communications involving attorney-client confidences
between any Seller, its Affiliates or the Company and GT for the purpose of
negotiating, documenting and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company), (ii) the
Company shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
GT primarily relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall
have occurred; and (iii) upon and after the Closing, (A) the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall be the sole holders of
the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and the Company
shall not be a holder thereof, (B) to the extent that files of GT in respect
of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall hold such property
rights and (C) GT shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between GT and the Company or otherwise.
Notwithstanding, anything herein to the contrary, it is understood that
communications, status updates and advice prior to the Closing with the
Company regarding legal matters involving the Company not made for the primary
purpose of the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement (and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the other
agreements, instruments and documents contemplated hereby or delivered in
connection herewith) shall remain the property of the Company from and after
Closing.

 



70 (b) Each of Buyer Parties and the Company acknowledges and agree that all
Transaction Materials shall constitute the sole and exclusive property of the
Representative, and, following the Closing none of the Buyer Parties or the
Company shall use or have any right to any such Transaction Materials
(including copies thereof, other than copies retained for legal archival
purposes or pursuant to automatic backup procedures; _provided_ that such
copies shall not be used or accessed for any purpose) (it being understood and
agreed that any such Transaction Materials may be transferred to the Sellers
or their respective Affiliates and fully deleted from the records (regardless
of media) of the Company). To the extent that any of the Buyer Parties or the
Company comes into possession of any Transaction Materials following
the Closing, such Persons shall not use such Transaction Materials for any
purpose.
