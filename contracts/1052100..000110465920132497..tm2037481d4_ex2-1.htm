with the termination of this Agreement, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the

shall have any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions and in no event
will the Company or Parent, as applicable, seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in
law or equity with respect to (A)&nbsp;any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, (B)&nbsp;the
termination of this Agreement, (C)&nbsp;any Liabilities arising under this Agreement or (D)&nbsp;any Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement; and (y)&nbsp;if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company, or the Company receives
any payments from Parent, in each case in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Company Termination
Fee or the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U>, then the amount of such Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the
Company or Parent, as applicable, prior to paying the applicable termination fee in respect of any such breaches. Upon payment
of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective former, current or future partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further Liability or obligation to Parent or Merger
Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and upon payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee,
none of Parent, Merger Sub, Parent Guarantor or their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates, Subsidiaries or Representatives shall have any further Liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the right to receive the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect Parent&rsquo;s and Merger Sub&rsquo;s or the
Company&rsquo;s right to specific performance as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;9.10</U>, it being understood and agreed that a party
shall not be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the Closing to occur and the payment
of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable.</P>
