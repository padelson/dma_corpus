Section 2.6 _Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective

Section 2.7 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_ .

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof:

  



  

(i) each share of Company Common Stock (including each share of
Company Common Stock described in _Section 2.8(b)_) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock directly owned and held by Parent or Merger Sub (each such share of
Company Common Stock, an "Excluded Share")), shall be converted into the
right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration") and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with _Section 3.7_;

  



  

(ii) all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
shall cease to be issued and outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a valid certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") or evidenced by way of book-entry in
the register of stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Book-entry Shares"), in each case other than those
representing Excluded Shares, shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration; and

  



  

(iii) each issued and outstanding share of stock of Merger Sub shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury
of the Company or owned of record by any Company Subsidiary, and all Excluded
Shares shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment or any consideration therefor and

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company
Common Stock, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as
of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section
3.7_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value
of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
to control all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment (unless required by Law) with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Treatment of Company RSUs and Company Restricted
Stock._

  



  

(a) Each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
be converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to
(a) (i) the Merger Consideration, _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _plus_ (b) the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividend
equivalent rights under such Company RSU, net of any Taxes withheld pursuant
to _Section 3.7_. Following the Effective Time, no such Company RSU that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding,
and each former holder of any such Company RSU shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth
in this _Section 2.8(a)_ in exchange for such Company RSU in accordance with
this _Section 2.8(a)_. The consideration payable under this _Section
2.8(a)_ to each former holder of a Company RSU that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid through the
Surviving Corporation's payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (x)
take all actions necessary or appropriate to effectuate the treatment of
the Company RSUs contemplated by this _Section 2.8(a)_, and (y) deliver
written notice to each holder of a Company RSU informing such holder of the
effect of the Merger on the Company RSUs.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock shall immediately vest in full and any forfeiture
restrictions applicable to such Company Restricted Stock shall immediately
lapse. By virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated as a
share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms
hereof, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
vesting. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Restricted Stock contemplated by this _Section 2.8(b)_.

  



  

Section 2.9 _No Right to Equity under Awards_

  



  

. The parties agree that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
RSU or any other equity-based awards shall have any right to acquire any
Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights)
in the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_

  



  

. In the event that the Company changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, at any time during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 2.10_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take
any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this
Agreement.

  



  

Article III 
 Exchange of Certificates

  



  

Section 3.1 _Paying Agent_. Concurrently with the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company as Parent shall determine and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with _Section
2.7_, immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the
Merger Consideration subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Section
3.2_. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund." If for any reason (including losses) the
Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled under _Section 2.7, _Parent shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
payments required under this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Any amounts payable in respect of Company RSUs shall
not be deposited with the Paying Agent but shall instead be paid through the
payroll of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates in accordance with
_Section 2.8(a)_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the
Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company Common Stock that have become
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall send to each record holder of a Certificate or holder of Book-
entry Shares (other than Excluded Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares),
(x) upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in _Section
3.6_) to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent; (y) upon the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock that are
Book-entry Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), in
accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and
accompanying instructions (including such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent); or (z) upon the transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock that are Book-entry Shares held through DTC, including by
delivery of an "agent's message," in accordance with DTC's procedures and
such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Paying Agent and DTC, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
therefor as promptly as practicable, the amount of cash into which the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Book-entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and Book-
entry Shares upon compliance by the respective holders thereof with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

  



  

(b) No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_. Any Certificate that has been surrendered
shall be cancelled by the Paying Agent.

  



  

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check in the
proper amount of cash pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ may be issued with
respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee only if (i) in the
case of Book-entry Shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of
Book-entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, and (ii) in the case of
Certificates, the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case, together with all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

  



  

Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. All cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of _Article II_ and this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
nine months after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation,
and any holders of Certificates or Book-entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III _shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) for the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates or Book-entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 3.2_, without interest. If, immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-entry Shares has not
complied with the procedures in _Section 3.2_ to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate or Book-entry Shares for Merger Consideration
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Any funds included in
the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively. No losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates
or Book-entry Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary
form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company RSU
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to
the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances, and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired, or to be acquired, by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-entry Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein or by Law.

such date) that, except (i) as otherwise expressly disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents filed after January 1, 2019 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than (x) any information that is contained solely in the

good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, and has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case
may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The Company has delivered or caused to be delivered to Parent
and Merger Sub true and complete copies of the Company
Organizational Documents, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each material Company
Subsidiary and each Company Subsidiary that is not wholly owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company. The Company is not in violation in any material
respect of the Company Organizational Documents, and the Company Subsidiaries
are not in violation in any material respect of their respective
organizational or governing documents.

  



  

(c) Section 4.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of each Company Subsidiary as of the date of this
Agreement and its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. All of the
outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary are owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any other
limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting securities or
other ownership interests) (other than restrictions arising under applicable
securities Laws).

  



  

Section 4.2 _Authority_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party, and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and (subject to and assuming the receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval in connection with the Merger) to
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.5_, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions, including the Merger, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to adopt or authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions other than, with respect to
the consummation of the Merger, the Company Stockholder Approval and the

legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or in equity) (the

execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Merger, without any further action on the part of the stockholders of the
Company or the Company Board. At a meeting duly called and held at which all
of the directors of the Company were present, the Company Board duly and

their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) any matter addressed in clause (a)(ii) of
this _Section 4.3_ other than as of the date of this Agreement; or (iii) any

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with  _Section 8.1_, except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 6.3_,
the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
Representatives of the Company not to, and shall not authorize or permit the
Representatives of the Company to, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(i) initiate, solicit, cooperate with, assist, participate in or
knowingly take any action to encourage, induce or facilitate (including
by way of providing non-public information relating to the Company or Company
Subsidiaries or affording access to the business or properties of the
Company) the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(ii) enter into, participate or engage in discussions or

(iii) approve, adopt, endorse, declare advisable or recommend to the
Company's stockholders, or publicly propose to approve, adopt,
endorse, declare advisable or recommend to the Company's stockholders, any

committee of the Company Board) has determined that any Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iv) (A) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation or to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (B) following the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal, fail to publish, send or give to the Company's
stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
within the ten Business Day period (as specified in Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) after such tender offer or exchange offer is
first published, sent or given, or subsequently amended in any material
respect, a statement affirming the Company Board Recommendation; or (C)
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw,
change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that any failure to
publicly and without qualification reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or
any request by Parent to do so (which request may only be made once with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, except that Parent may make an
additional request after any material change in the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal) will be treated as a withdrawal of the Company Board Recommendation
that is adverse to Parent for purposes hereof) (any action or failure to act
taken by the Company Board (or by any committee of the Company Board) set
forth in the foregoing clause (iii) or this clause (iv), a "Change of Board
Recommendation");

  



  

(v) take any action to make any Takeover Law inapplicable to any
third party or any Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(vi) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, term sheet,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract constituting, relating to or that is intended to or is reasonably
likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Transactions, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions; or

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(vii) fail to enforce, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission or a release under, any standstill,
confidentiality agreement or similar Contract with respect to any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party; _provided_ that if the Company Board
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
(A) the Company may waive any such standstill or similar agreement to the
extent necessary to permit the Person bound by such provision or agreement to
make an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board and (B) concurrently with
such waiver by the Company, any standstill or similar provisions in the
Parent Confidentiality Agreement or in the Letter Agreement, dated as of
October 14, 2020, by and between the Company and LPL shall immediately and
automatically be waived and cease to be of any force or effect).

  



  

The Company shall (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Representatives of the
Company with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (B) promptly after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, demand the return or destruction of
all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to any such Persons prior to the date hereof, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with the recipient of such information.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.3(a)_, at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the time when the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event after the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained), in response to a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof that the Company
Board determines in good faith After Consultation constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and with respect to
which the Company Board determines in good faith After Consultation, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law, then the
Company and the Representatives of the Company may, subject to compliance
with this _Section 6.3_, (i) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, and only with, the Person (or such Person's
representatives) that has made such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) furnish to
the Person (or such Person's representatives) that has made the Acquisition
Proposal information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or the
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company did
not receive such Acquisition Proposal in connection with or as a result of
breaching or violating the terms of this _Section 6.3 _(other than an
isolated, inadvertent and immaterial breach or violation).

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Section 6.3(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) after the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, and prior
to engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnishing information to, a Person (or such Person's representatives) who has
made an Acquisition Proposal, (i) notify Parent of the receipt by the Company
or the Representatives of the Company of such Acquisition Proposal, which
notice shall include (A) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) the identity of the Person or Group making any such
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) contemporaneously with or prior to furnishing
any information to such Person (or such Person's representatives), furnish
such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent). The Company (or its outside
counsel) shall (w) keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; (x) promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide notice to Parent of any change in the terms (including all
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal; (y) upon Parent's request
provide an update on the status of discussions regarding the terms (including
all amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal; and (z) promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent
(or its outside counsel) with copies of all material documents (including any
written or electronic material to the extent such material contains any
financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, including the financing thereof) exchanged between the
Company or Company Subsidiaries or any of the Representatives of the Company,
on the one hand, and the Person making an Acquisition Proposal or any of its
Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the
other hand. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the information described
in _Section 6.3(b)_ or this _Section 6.3(c)_ to Parent.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, other than in
connection with or as a result of breaching or violating this _Section 6.3_
(other than an isolated, inadvertent and immaterial breach or violation),
that the Company Board concludes in good faith, After Consultation,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to
the time when the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event
after such Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), if it determines in
good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to take such
actions contemplated by clauses (x) or (y) below would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation as a result of such Superior
Proposal or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ and
simultaneously enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent and otherwise complies
with the provisions of _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ and _Section 8.2_; and, _provided
further_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board
Recommendation or termination (the "Superior Proposal Notice Period"), of its
intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice
itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or to terminate
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
implementing such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon
which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation
or terminate this Agreement and the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (and the identity of the Person or Group making such
Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution
draft of the relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements with the
Person making such Superior Proposal (the  "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") and other material documents with respect to such Superior
Proposal (including any with respect to the financing thereof); and

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal, (A) during the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated (to the extent
Parent wishes to so negotiate), and shall have caused the Representatives of
the Company to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make
any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B)
following the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board
shall have considered any such amendments in good faith, and After
Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding
the terms of any such proposed amendments, such Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)(i)_ and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(d)_ with respect to such new
written notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except that
the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be at least two Business Days
(rather than the four Business Days contemplated by _Section 6.3(d)(i)_
above).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, and solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board
may effect a Change of Board Recommendation prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event after such
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained) if the Company Board determines in
good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Board may not
effect such a Change of Board Recommendation unless:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board
Recommendation (the "Intervening Event Notice Period"), of its intention to
effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not
constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice shall specify the
details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board
intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (A)
during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated
(to the extent Parent wishes to so negotiate), and shall have caused the
Representatives of the Company to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to
enable Parent to make any amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary,
and (B) following the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the
Company Board shall have considered any such amendments in good faith and,
After Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that,
notwithstanding the terms of any such binding written offer, it would continue
to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law
to not effect the Change of Board Recommendation.

  



  

In the event of any changes to the circumstances applicable to the
Intervening Event after the start of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant
to _Section 6.3(e)(i)_ and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice (including a new Intervening
Event Notice Period) except that the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be
two Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by _Section
6.3(e)(i)_ above).

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement

  



  

(i) "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn and that did not result
from a breach or violation (other than an isolated, inadvertent and immaterial
breach or violation) of the provisions of _Section 6.3_), (with all
references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being deemed to
be references to "50%"), that (A) if a cash transaction (whether in whole or
in part), is not subject to a financing condition (and if financing is
required, such financing is then fully committed and reasonably determined to
be available by the Company Board); (B) is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms and conditions contemplated thereby; and (C)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith After Consultation is
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as such)
from a financial point of view than the Merger, in each case taking into
account such factors as are determined by the Company Board in good faith to
be relevant, including (I) the identity of the Person(s) making such
Acquisition Proposal and the prior history of such Person(s) with the
consummation or failure to consummate similar transactions, (II)
the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of the
transaction contemplated by such offer or proposal, including any
governmental or other approval requirements (including divestitures and entry
into other commitments and limitations) and (III) any proposal to amend this
agreement made by Parent in connection therewith or in response thereto; and

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(ii) "Intervening Event" means any material, favorable event or
development or material, favorable change in circumstances with respect to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole that (A) is
materially more favorable to the recurring financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B)
was neither known to the Company Board or any officer of the Company, nor
reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (or if
known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board); and (C) does not
relate to (I) any Acquisition Proposal, (II) any events, changes or
circumstances relating to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
including the announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the
Transactions, or compliance with or performance under this Agreement or the
Transactions, (III) clearance of the Transactions under the HSR Act or
compliance with any other Antitrust Laws or receipt of the other Regulatory
Approvals, (IV) the fact the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement, (V) changes after the date of this
Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock
or the credit rating of the Company or (VI) any event, development or change
in circumstances resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the Company or
any action relating to any Regulatory Approval (including the status thereof)
taken pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent
to revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any
amendment to this Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be
disclosed in any Company SEC Documents.

  



  

(h) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Subsidiary
or Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company,
would constitute a breach of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.3_ shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3 _by the Company.

  



  

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or otherwise complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9, in each case in response to a tender
offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise permitted under this
_Section 6.3_, such disclosure is limited to (i) a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation.

  



  

(j) The Company shall not make any Change of Board Recommendation
that purports to change the approval of the Company Board in a way that would
result in any Takeover Law becoming applicable to the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Efforts; Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,

notices, petitions, filings or other documents in the event they are rejected
for any reason by the relevant Governmental Entity; and (ii) taking all
actions or steps as may be necessary, including promptly providing
any additional information requested by any Governmental Entity, to obtain as
promptly as practicable the expiration or termination of the waiting period
in connection with the HSR Filings, the Regulatory Approvals and any other
consents, approvals, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations and Orders necessary or advisable from any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and the Wealth
Management Transactions.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.4(a)_:

Parent, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) timely provide
to the Company all information required to complete the FINRA Joint
Application and to respond to any further FINRA requests.

  



  

(iii) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer

of the conditions to each party's obligations or the other party's obligations
set forth in _Article VII _not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5 _shall not
cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and

  



  

(b) commencing with the first month end following the date hereof,
the Company shall, within ten Business Days after each such month end,

Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions (including any communication required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be issued
by any party or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable national
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press
release of each of the Company and Parent announcing the execution and

releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company
and Parent and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the
other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions; and (iii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.6 _shall not apply to any release

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which
any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(the "Company Employees") will participate effective as of or after the
Effective Time (collectively, "New Plans"), subject to applicable Law and
applicable Tax qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with
the Company or a Company Subsidiary to the extent recognized under each
Company Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement that is reflected in
the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting,
eligibility and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes,
except for vacation and severance, if applicable, and not for purposes of any
defined benefit or retiree medical plan) in any New Plan in which such Company
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case
except to the extent that recognizing such service would result in a
duplication of benefits. To the extent any Company Employee in the United
States participates in a New Plan that is a welfare plan or arrangement of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary following the Closing Date (a "Parent Welfare
Plan"), Parent and any Parent Subsidiary shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and any insurer or service provider under the applicable Parent
Welfare Plan, use commercially reasonable efforts (including adopting any
required plan amendments) to cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations
that otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Company
Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employee's
commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan; (ii)
participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that would
otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the same
extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to such
Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
immediately prior to such Company Employee's commencement of participation in
such Parent Welfare Plan; and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by
Company Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be
credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan, but only to the extent that
the Company provides documentation of such co-payments and deductibles
reasonably requested by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary within 20 days of
such request.

  



  

(b) For a period of twelve months following the Closing Date (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide and shall cause the Affiliates
of Parent and their respective successors to provide each Company Employee as
of the Effective Time who continues to be employed by Parent or any Affiliate
of Parent (the "Continuing Employees") with: (i) a base salary or base wage
rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) a target annual incentive
opportunity that is, at the discretion of Parent, either (A) substantially
comparable in the aggregate (taking into account annual
incentive compensation payable in either cash or the grant of an equity
award) to those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B)
substantially comparable in the aggregate (taking into account annual
incentive compensation payable in either cash or the grant of an equity award)
to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates; and (iii) employee health and welfare benefits (excluding defined
benefit pension benefits, retiree health and welfare and severance benefits)
that are, at the discretion of Parent, either substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those (A) provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B) that
are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries from time to time. Additionally, Parent agrees that each
Continuing Employee shall, during the Continuation Period, be entitled to the
severance arrangement described in Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent
with a copy of any written communication and a copy of the script for any
unwritten communication, in each case to be broadly disseminated to employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the principal purpose of which
is to communicate information regarding the Transactions, Wealth Management
Transactions or employment, retention, compensation, benefits or other
treatment they will receive in connection with or following the Merger or the
Wealth Management Transactions a reasonable amount of time prior to such
dissemination, and shall consider in good faith for inclusion any reasonable
comments from Parent to such communication that Parent makes in good faith
after Parent's receipt of such communication (unless such communication is
substantively similar to such prior communications that have been initially
made after such announcement of the Merger or prior communications that have
been previously provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_.

  



  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Affiliates of Parent (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and their respective successors to, honor, pay, perform and
satisfy any and all Liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or in
respect of, each Company Employee arising under the terms of any employment,
consulting, retention, severance, change of control or similar plan,
agreement or arrangement, in accordance with the terms thereof in effect on
the Closing Date unless prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions
as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to
effect such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the "401(k)
Plan"), including amending or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law
and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of
the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan.

  



  

(f) This  _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 6.7_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 6.7_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as
an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.7 _or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company
Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Revenue Run Rate; Client Consent Percentage_.

  



  

(a) For each full calendar month beginning January 2021 and
continuing until the Closing (other than the calendar month
immediately preceding the month in which the Closing occurs), the Company
shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to Parent, no later than ten
Business Days after the end of such month, a schedule setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculation of the Revenue Run Rate as of the last
Business Day of such month.

  



  

(b) By no later than the fourth Business Day following the date upon
which the Calculation Time occurs, the Company shall deliver to Parent its
good faith calculation of the Base Date Revenue Run Rate, Closing Revenue Run
Rate, the Client Consent Percentage calculated based thereon and the Company
Advisor Percentage, together with reasonable supporting detail with respect to
the calculations thereof. To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the
Company shall promptly make available (during normal business hours) to
Parent the employees and Representatives of the Company involved in, and
records used in, preparing the calculation of the Base Date Revenue Run Rate,
Closing Revenue Run Rate, the Client Consent Percentage and the Company
Advisor Percentage. The Company and Parent shall work in good faith to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Base Date
Revenue Run Rate, Closing Revenue Run Rate, the Client Consent Percentage and
the Company Advisor Percentage.

Section 6.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (with respect to Parent, only to the
extent the Surviving Corporation is permitted to do so under applicable Law),
jointly and severally, indemnify all Company Indemnified Parties to the same
extent such individuals are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Organizational Documents,
the governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
or indemnification agreements between such Company Indemnified Party and the
Company or a Company Subsidiary ("Company Indemnification Agreements"),
arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that any such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under applicable Law; _provided further_ , that if
any valid claim for indemnification is made hereunder by a Company Indemnified
Party prior to six years after the Effective Time, such indemnification
obligation will survive (solely with respect to such claim) until the final
resolution of the matter giving rise to such claim. The Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall, jointly and severally, advance to the Company
Indemnified Parties expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, the governing
or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or Company
Indemnification Agreements, in each case in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the director or officer to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to the
Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law or pursuant to
the applicable organizational document or Company Indemnification Agreement.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company
Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, the governing or
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or Company Indemnification
Agreements, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall be
made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and
reasonably acceptable to the Company Indemnified Party (such acceptance not
to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). During this six year
period, without the prior written consent of the Company Indemnified Party,
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Company Indemnified
Party as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, the
organizational or governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries or any
Company Indemnification Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall not be amended, restated, amended and restated, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner (whether by merger, consolidation,
division, operation of law or otherwise) that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Company Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and
officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
Company Indemnified Parties as such policies maintained by the Company as of
the date hereof with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be obligated to expend an amount in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would
at any time exceed the Premium Cap or such coverage is not otherwise
available, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, Parent or the Company may
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the
Company's existing directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance
policies providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount
that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other Person, then in each such case, Parent will cause, to the
extent necessary, proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

  



  

Section 6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall (a) take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law or
any similar provision of the Company Organizational Documents is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such
Takeover Law, regulation or provision is or becomes applicable to the Merger
or any other Transactions, cooperate and grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock and
shares of Company Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of Company Restricted
Stock pursuant to this Agreement) resulting from the Transactions by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Company SEC Documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act. As of its filing date, or if amended after the date of
such filing, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC
Document shall fully comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be.
As of its filing date or, if amended after the date of such filing, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC Document
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement,
as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed after the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective after the date of this Agreement,
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

  



  

Section 6.13 _No Rights Plan_. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the date this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company shall not,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any stockholder
rights agreement, rights plan, "poison pill" or other similar agreement,
unless such plan or agreement exempts from its application this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.14 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meetings_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials for
the Special Meeting (together with any amendments and supplements thereto and
any other required proxy materials, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the
Merger and this Agreement. Subject to _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Section
6.3(e)_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation and the
opinion of the Company Financial Advisor (in its entirety) in the Proxy
Statement together with a summary of such opinion. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall promptly provide to the Company such
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested
by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and
other applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.14(a)_, prior to
filing the preliminary Proxy Statement, a definitive Proxy Statement or any
Other Filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, the Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on each such filing in advance, and the Company shall consider in
good faith for inclusion in such filing all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent in respect of such filings. The Company shall notify Parent promptly
of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC or its staff (or
of notice of the SEC's intent to review) and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing
or for additional or supplemental information in connection therewith. The
Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the receipt of such
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any
such Other Filing (i) supply Parent with copies of all written correspondence
received in connection therewith and (ii) provide Parent a reasonably detailed
description of any oral comments received in connection therewith. The

comments reasonably proposed by Parent; (y) not file or mail such document, or
respond to the SEC or its staff, prior to receiving the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (z)
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate
in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff. The Company shall
respond in good faith to any comments by the SEC or its staff as promptly as
practicable. Parent shall provide its comments to the Company as promptly as
practicable.

  



  

(c) If the Company (i) does not receive comments from the SEC with
respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, then the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file definitive proxy materials (including
the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the expiration of the ten-day waiting period
provided in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act, or (ii) does receive
comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file definitive
proxy materials (including the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after clearance by the SEC
with respect to such comments.

  



  

(d) If, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting,
Parent or the Company discovers any event or information relating to
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information to be filed with the SEC as
promptly as practicable thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable
Law as determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel by
the Company Board, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company's bylaws (i) duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders as promptly
as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under applicable
Law) no earlier than 30 days and no later than 40 days after the mailing of
the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Special Meeting")
and (ii) take all lawful actions to solicit from the stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and secure any
other vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company as required by the
rules of the NYSE, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date that shall be set as the
"record date" for the Special Meeting in advance of providing notice thereof
to the NYSE and shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Special
Meeting. The Company shall not change the record date or postpone or
adjourn the Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ that the Company may, following consultation with Parent, adjourn
the Special Meeting (x) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith is necessary to
comply with applicable Law, is made available to the Company's stockholders
in advance of the Special Meeting or (y) to the extent that, as of the time
that the Special Meeting is originally scheduled, adjournment of the Special
Meeting is necessary as determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel by the Company Board to enable the Company to solicit
additional proxies required to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Special Meeting and to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval; and _provided further_ that the Company may adjourn the
Special Meeting if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary under applicable Law
to comply with the requirements made by the SEC or other applicable Law with
respect to the Proxy Statement or that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Company may, or if so requested by Parent shall, adjourn the Special Meeting
in order to provide for the expiration of the Superior Proposal Notice Period
or Intervening Event Notice Period, as applicable. The adoption of this
Agreement and adjournment of the Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of adoption of
this Agreement shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting, unless
otherwise approved in writing by Parent or required by Law.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject
to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_, the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Special Meeting shall not be affected by any Change
of Board Recommendation and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.14_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company agrees that
it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote
of the stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger at the Special
Meeting.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Investment Advisory Agreement Consents._

  



  

(a) _Clients other than Funds_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, in accordance with applicable Law and
the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the consent of each Client
(other than a Fund) for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment
of such Client's Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is required by applicable Law or by such Client's
Investment Advisory Agreement as a result of the Transactions. In furtherance
thereof, except in the case of an Affirmative Consent Client, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in no event less
than 60 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, send a written notice (the
"Negative Consent Notice"), in accordance with applicable Law and the
applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to such Clients informing each
Client: (i) of the Transactions; (ii) of the intention to complete the
Transactions, which will result in an assignment or deemed assignment of such
Investment Advisory Agreement; (iii) of the intention of the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary to continue to provide the advisory services
pursuant to the existing Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after
the Closing if such Client does not terminate such agreement prior to the
Closing; and (iv) that the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been
granted if such Client does not terminate its Investment Advisory Agreement,
within 60 calendar days after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice (or
such longer period as may be required under the Investment Advisory
Agreement). If the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement or applicable Law
requires the written consent of the Client to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or if the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary determines, in its discretion, that for commercial reasons
it would be prudent or appropriate to obtain the written consent of a Client
to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory
Agreement, then the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, send a written notice, in accordance with applicable Law, and
the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, informing such Client (an
"Affirmative Consent Client") of the Transactions and requesting written
consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment
Advisory Agreement, and any such Client shall be deemed a Non-Consenting
Client unless and until such Client has provided its written consent to the
assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory
Agreement.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(b) _Private Funds_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain with respect to each Private Fund, in accordance
with applicable Law and the applicable Fund Documents, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (x) the consent of
such Private Fund (or some percentage of the Private Fund's board of
directors, advisory committee, investment committee or investors therein, as
applicable) for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Private Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is required by applicable Law or by such Private Fund's Fund
Documents as a result of the Transactions and (y) any Additional Private Fund
Consent applicable to such Private Fund in furtherance thereof, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Public Funds_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Investment Adviser
Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, in
accordance with applicable Law, (A) as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement obtain the requisite approval of each of the Public Fund
Boards ("Public Fund Board Approval") of the Public Fund Board Approval Items
and the Sub-Advised Fund Board Approval Items, and (B) request that the
Public Funds obtain, as promptly as practicable following such approval of
the Public Fund Boards, the requisite approval of the shareholders of each
Public Fund ("Public Fund Shareholder Approval") of the Public Fund
Shareholder Approval Items and of each Sub-Advised Fund of the Sub-
Advised Fund Shareholder Approval Items (except if not required under
manager-of-managers exemptive orders granted under the Investment Company Act
with respect to any Sub-Advised Funds).

  



  

(ii) As promptly as practicable following Public Fund Board
Approval as described in _Section 6.15(c)(i)_, the Company (or one of the
Company Subsidiaries) and Parent shall (in coordination with the applicable
Public Fund and under the general direction of the applicable Public Fund
Board) jointly cooperate to (A) prepare and file all proxy materials necessary
to comply in all material respects with applicable Law for the Public Fund
shareholder meeting to approve the Public Fund Shareholder Approval Items as
contemplated by _Section 6.15(c)(i)_, (B) use commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly clear all SEC comments and (C) use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that such Public Fund Board (it being understood for all
purposes of this Agreement that the Company does not control any Public Fund
Board) submits, as promptly as practicable following the mailing of the proxy
materials, to the shareholders of such Public Fund for a vote at a
shareholders meeting the proposal to approve the Public Fund Shareholder
Approval Items. Each of the Company and Parent shall have an opportunity to
review all drafts of the proxy materials (and any SEC comments thereto) on a
timely basis and the right to review in advance of submission to the SEC the
proxy materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto) to be furnished to
the shareholders of any Public Fund and to (I) approve information or data
that is provided by or on behalf of such party or its Affiliates specifically
for inclusion in such proxy materials, and (II) provide reasonable comments
on such proxy materials, which the other party (in coordination with
the applicable Public Fund and under the general direction of the applicable
Public Fund Board) will consider in good faith for inclusion therein.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(iii) As soon as possible following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Public Fund then engaged in a public offering of its shares to (A) file
supplements or amendments to its prospectus forming a part of its
registration statement then currently in use, which supplements or amendments
shall disclose the Transactions to the extent required by applicable Law, and
(B) make any other filing necessary under any applicable Law to satisfy in
all material respects disclosure requirements in connection with the public
distribution of the shares of that Public Fund. Parent shall have the right
to provide reasonable comments on such materials to the same extent as
provided in _Section 6.15(c)(ii)_.

  



  

(iv) The Company agrees that the information in the proxy
materials to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund (other
than information that is or will be provided by or on behalf of Parent or any
other third party specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials) will
not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ that in the case of a Public Fund that is not
sponsored by the Company or Company Subsidiaries (a Sub-Advised Fund), the
foregoing agreement of the Company shall apply only to information provided by
it or the Company Subsidiaries in writing specifically for inclusion in such
proxy materials. Parent agrees that the information provided by it (or on its
behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy materials to be
furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund will not contain, as of the
date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(v) In addition to the agreements described in this _Section
6.15(c)_ and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, concurrently with
seeking the Public Fund Board Approvals, the Company shall seek an Interim
Public Fund IAA Approval with respect to each Public Fund, including each
Sub-Advised Fund. The Company and Parent shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval
in respect of each Public Fund, including each Sub-Advised Fund. In no event
shall seeking or obtaining an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval in respect of
a Public Fund relieve the parties of their obligations under _Sections
6.15(c)(i)-(iv)_ with respect to such Public Fund.

  



  

(vi) The Company shall, and shall cause its Investment Adviser
Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Investment Advisory Agreement of each Public Fund as of Closing
(or as agreed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to be in effect upon
or after the Closing) to be on terms and conditions substantially similar
(including as to the Applicable Fees) as the terms and conditions under such
Investment Advisory Agreement in effect as of the date hereof, unless such
Public Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement as of Closing is consistent with
the investment advisory agreement proposed by an investment advisor
Subsidiary of Parent for Public Fund Board Approval and Public Fund
Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(vii) The foregoing notwithstanding (A) an Interim Public Fund IAA
Approval shall not constitute Public Fund Board Approval or a Sub-
Advised Fund Board Approval in respect of a Public Fund and (B) the parties
agree that a Public Fund shall be deemed a Consenting Client for all purposes
under this Agreement only if the requisite Public Fund Board Approval, the
Sub-Advised Fund Board Approval, the Public Fund Shareholder Approval and the
Sub-Advised Fund Shareholder Approval, as applicable, has been obtained and is
in full force and effect at the Closing for the Public Fund IAA Approval.

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(d) Parent and the Company agree that any new Client that is not a
Fund that enters into an Investment Advisory Agreement with an
Investment Adviser Subsidiary between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing shall be deemed a Consenting Client for all purposes under this
Agreement if (i) the consent (or, as applicable, deemed consent) of such new
Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment
Advisory Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
the Transactions has been obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.15_ or
(ii) the Company has disclosed in writing, in accordance with applicable Law,
the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory
Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of the
Transactions to such new Client before such new Client became a Client and, in
any case under the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), such new Client has not,
prior to Closing, terminated in writing its Investment Advisory Agreement or
revoked in writing its consent.

  



  

(e) In connection with obtaining the Client consents and other
actions required by this _Section 6.15_, at all times prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent promptly informed
of the status of obtaining such Client consents and, upon Parent's reasonable
request, make available to Parent copies of all such executed Client
consents and make available for Parent's inspection the originals of such
consents and any related materials and other records relating to the Client
consent process. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with obtaining
the Client consents required under this _Section 6.15_, Parent and, in the
case of any Client of the Wealth Management Business, LPL shall have the
right to review in advance of distribution any notices or other materials to
be distributed by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to Clients and
shall have the right to have its reasonable commented reflected therein prior
to distribution. In no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary be
required to offer or grant any material accommodation or material alteration
of terms (financial or otherwise) in respect of any Client for the purpose of
obtaining the Client consents contemplated by this _Section 6.15_.

  



  

(f) Each party hereto shall (i) reasonably cooperate with and
assist each other party hereto and their respective Affiliates in
connection with obtaining the approvals and consents sought pursuant to this
_Section 6.15_, and (ii) promptly provide to the other applicable parties in
writing all information concerning such party and its Affiliates as is
reasonably required or otherwise reasonably requested in order to solicit
each Public Fund Board and otherwise seek to obtain the approvals and
consents to be sought pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ (including all
information as is customarily included in such solicitations, or requests for
approvals and consents, prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement).

  



  

Section 6.16 _Conversion Consents_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, in accordance with applicable Law
and the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
consent of each Client (other than a Fund) for (x) the transfer of Client
assets from the Company's transfer agent Subsidiary or third-party custodian,
as applicable, to LPL (or its designated Affiliate) and (y) the transfer of
the brokerage and advisory services provided to such Clients from Waddell and
Reed, Inc. to LPL (or its designated Affiliate), in each case in connection
with the Wealth Management Transactions (the "Conversion"). In furtherance
thereof, except in the case of any Client for whom affirmative consent is
required under applicable Law or the applicable brokerage agreement or
Investment Advisory Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
FINRA's approval of the applicable consent letters, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, send a written notice
(the "Conversion Negative Consent Notice"), in accordance with applicable Law
and the applicable brokerage agreement or the Investment Advisory Agreement,
which notice shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to such Clients informing each Client: (a) of the Conversion; (b) of the
intention of LPL to complete the Conversion, which will result in an
assignment of such brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement and
the transfer of such Client's account to LPL; (c) of the intention of LPL to
provide brokerage, advisory or custody services pursuant to the existing
brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after
the Conversion if such Client does not terminate its brokerage agreement or
Investment Advisory Agreement prior to the Conversion; and (d) that the
consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client
does not terminate its brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement,
within 45 calendar days after the sending of the Conversion Negative Consent
Notice (or such longer period as may be required under the applicable
brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement). If the applicable
brokerage agreement, Investment Advisory Agreement or applicable Law
requires the written consent of the Client to the assignment of such Client's
brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or if the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary
determines, in its discretion, that for commercial reasons it would be
prudent or appropriate to obtain the written consent of a Client to such
assignment, then the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, send a written notice, in accordance with applicable Law, and
the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, which
notice shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
informing such Client of the Conversion and requesting written consent to the
assignment of such Client's brokerage agreement or Investment
Advisory Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
coordinate the timing and content of the mailings contemplated by this
_Section 6.16_ and the mailings contemplated by _Section 6.15(a)_ with
Parent and LPL.

commercially reasonable efforts after the Effective Time to conduct its
business to enable the following to be true regarding Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act in relation to any Public Fund for which any Company
Subsidiary or Parent or any of its Affiliates provides investment advisory or
sub-advisory services: (i) for a period of not less than three years after

directors or trustees of any Public Fund shall be "interested persons" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Company, any Subsidiary, Parent
or any of its Affiliates or any other investment adviser for such Public Fund
and (ii) for a period of not less than two years after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall impose an "unfair burden"
(within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, including any

result of the Transactions or any express or implied terms, conditions or
understandings applicable thereto.

  



  

(b) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Parent
shall not engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in
any transaction that would constitute an "assignment" (as that term is
defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and
interpreted by the SEC) to a third party of any Investment Advisory Agreement
between Parent or any of its Affiliates and any Public Fund, without first
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the counterparty to such
transaction a covenant in all material respects comparable to that contained
in this _Section 6.17_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent or any of
its Affiliates obtains an exemptive order from the SEC as contemplated by
Section 15(f)(3) of the Investment Company Act, then this covenant shall be
deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to permit Parent and
its Affiliates to act in a manner consistent with such SEC exemptive order.

  



  

Section 6.18 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any stockholder demands, litigations, arbitrations or other
similar Actions (including derivative claims) commenced against it or its
respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions or any matters relating thereto (collectively, "Transaction
Litigation") and shall keep Parent informed regarding any such Transaction
Litigation. The Company (a) shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation and
(b) shall keep Parent reasonably apprised on a prompt basis of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to any Transaction
Litigation, and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such
Transaction Litigation, which the Company shall consider in good faith. The
Company shall not settle or offer, compromise or agree to settle or
compromise, or take any other action to settle, compromise or moot,
any Transaction Litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

Section 6.19 _WARN Act_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with a list of any Company Employees (by date, employer
and location) who incurred an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act)
within the ninety-day period immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.20 _Wealth Management Transactions_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.2_, solely for the benefit of Parent,
the Company shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates
and Representatives to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take any
actions reasonably requested by Parent in connection with, or to facilitate,
the consummation of the Wealth Management Transactions, including (i)
providing LPL reasonable access to Company Advisors and employees of the
Wealth Management Business during regular business hours; (ii) assisting with
the migration of Company Advisors to LPL, including facilitation of
transition assistance offered by LPL and execution by Company Advisors
of registered representative agreements or investment advisor representative
agreements, as applicable, with LPL; (iii) facilitating the separation of the
Wealth Management Business and identifying any shared assets, facilities and
employees; (iv) facilitating the provision, after the Effective Time, of
transition services to the extent necessary; and (v) obtaining the LPL
Regulatory Approvals and any other necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from any Governmental Entity or third party in connection with the Wealth
Management Transactions.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Wealth Management
Purchase Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
LPL and its controlled Affiliates to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to consummate the Wealth
Management Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in the Wealth
Management Purchase Agreement, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to closing set forth in
Section 3.2 of the Wealth Management Purchase Agreement. Parent shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce their rights and LPL's obligations
under the Wealth Management Purchase Agreement. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, consent to any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any provision of Section 3.2 or Section 6.3 of the
Wealth Management Purchase Agreement, or any other provision of the Wealth
Management Purchase Agreement that would have the effect of amending,
modifying or waiving any provision of such Sections of the Wealth
Management Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed.

pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, to receive an amount greater than an amount

termination of this Agreement, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the Company and the Company

and none of the Company or Company Subsidiaries, or Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, or any of their respective former, current or
future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives, shall have any further Liability or obligation relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions and in no event will the
Company or Parent, as applicable, seek to recover any other money damages or
seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to (A)
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated, (B) the termination of this Agreement, (C) any Liabilities
arising under this Agreement or (D) any Actions arising out of or relating to

Company, or the Company receives any payments from Parent, in each case in
respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the
Company Termination Fee or the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, then the amount of such Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of such payments made by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, prior to paying the applicable termination fee in respect of any
such breaches. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective former, current or
future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further Liability or obligation to Parent or
Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
and upon payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, Parent Guarantor or their respective former, current or future
partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates, Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall have any further Liability or obligation to Parent or
Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the right to receive the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee shall not limit or
otherwise affect Parent's and Merger Sub's or the Company's right to specific
performance as provided in _Section 9.10_, it being understood and agreed
that a party shall not be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance to cause the Closing to occur and the payment of the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
(i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of
the Transactions; (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement; and (iii) the Company
Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee are not penalties, but rather
constitute damages in a reasonable amount that will partially compensate
Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable in the circumstances in
which such a termination fee is payable.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee when due, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent
Termination Fee when due, the party that fails to pay such termination fee
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by them (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this _Section 8.3_, together with interest on the Company Termination Fee
or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime rate as quoted on
Bloomberg screen (PRIMBB Index) in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment plus 2% per annum (such
interest, together with reasonable costs and expenses of enforcement as
provided above, "Collection Expenses").

provision of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of
any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute

Section 9.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or

determined only in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto (i)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other process in any Action relating to the Transactions, on behalf of itself
or its property, in accordance with _Section 9.4_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by applicable Law, and agrees that nothing in this _Section
9.9(b)_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits itself and its property in any Action to the exclusive
general jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware) in any Action seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection
with, this Agreement or the Transactions or for recognition and enforcement of
any judgment in respect thereof, (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from any such court; (iv) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such Action in any such court or that such
Action was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same; and (v) agrees that it shall not bring any Action relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final
judgment in any Action in such court as provided above shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section _
_9.9(c)_.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that any defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby waived. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement (in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies at law or in equity), and all such rights and remedies shall be
cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by _Section 8.3(d)_. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
waived.

  



  

   

93

 



    



  

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Parent
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding among the
parties hereto with respect to the Transactions and supersede and replace all
prior written and prior and contemporaneous oral agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with regard to the Transactions. All Exhibits
and Schedules hereto (including the Company Disclosure Schedules) and any
documents and instruments delivered pursuant to any provision hereof are
expressly made a part of this Agreement as fully as though completely set

Section 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute the
same instrument.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule
accompanying this Agreement shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in such Disclosure Schedule, that such information is
required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, or that such information is material to any party or
the conduct of the business of any party. The information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely
for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of any
Contract. Any item set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, with respect to a particular
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to all other applicable
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement to the
extent any description of facts regarding the event, item or matter is
disclosed in such a way as to make it apparent on its face, or it is specified
in such disclosure, that such item is applicable to such other
representations, warranties or covenants whether or not such item is so
numbered.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Parent Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent
Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as
primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Company the full, complete
and timely payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub (each of Parent
and Merger Sub, a "Parent Party") of each and every obligation, Liability,
covenant and other agreement of any Parent Party in this Agreement (excluding
the investment advisory agreements and the interim investment advisory
agreements, if any, between Affiliates of the Parent Parties and the Public
Funds or other Clients, as applicable, and all of the obligations of the
Parent Parties thereunder), in each case as the same may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (collectively, the
"Parent Guaranteed Obligations"), in each case whether or not any bankruptcy
or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any
Parent Guaranteed Obligation or operated as a discharge thereof (the "Parent
Guaranty").

  



  

(b) Parent Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Parent
Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of performance and of payment when due of
the Parent Guaranteed Obligations and not just of collection, and Parent
Guarantor waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Person to
enforce any of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations against any Parent Party or
any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent Guarantor
hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Parent
Guaranty and of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, presentation, demand for
payment, dishonor, protest, default notice of non-performance, notice of
incurrence of any of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, all other notices of
any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any
right to require the marshalling of assets of any Parent Party or any other
Person interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally.

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(c) Parent Guarantor agrees that the Company may, at any time and
from time to time, without notice to or further consent of Parent
Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the Parent Guaranteed
Obligations, and may also make any agreement with any Parent Party for the
extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in
whole or in part, without in any way impairing or affecting Parent
Guarantor's obligations under this Agreement. Parent Guarantor agrees that the
Parent Guaranty or the Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released,
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure
of any Person to assert any claim, make any demand, or enforce or exercise
any right or remedy against any Parent Party or any other Person, whether
under this Agreement or otherwise; (ii) any change in the time, place or
manner of payment of any Parent Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition or
substitution of any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Parent
Guaranteed Obligations, to or from this Agreement; (iv) any change in the
corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Parent Party; (v) any
amendment or modification to, or waiver of, the terms of this Agreement; (vi)
the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up of, or any
similar or analogous event involving or affecting, any Parent Party; (vii) the
existence of any claim, set-off or other right that Parent Guarantor may have
at any time against any Parent Party or the Company, whether in connection
with the Parent Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; (viii) the adequacy of
any other means Parent may have of obtaining payment or performance of the
Parent Guaranteed Obligations; or (ix) any other event or condition that, but
for the provisions hereof, would constitute a legal or equitable discharge of
the obligations of Parent Guarantor hereunder.

  



  

(d) The Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason,
including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise,
and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, claim, recoupment or
termination whatsoever by reason of invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of
the Parent Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.

  



  

(e) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating
to the Parent Guaranteed Obligations in the event that any Parent
Party becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding,
and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect Parent Guarantor's
obligations hereunder. Parent Guarantor agrees that the Parent Guaranty shall
continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case maybe, if at any time
payment or performance of any Parent Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Parent Party.

  



  

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent Guarantor
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, agrees not to assert or
otherwise take advantage of any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against any Parent Party, including rights arising from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of Parent Guarantor's
obligations under or in respect of the Parent Guaranty, this Agreement,
including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution
or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Company against any Parent Party, whether or not such claim, remedy or right
arises in equity or under Contract, statute or common law, including the
right to take or receive from such Parent Party, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or
security on account of such claim, remedy or right, until the full and
indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Parent Guaranteed
Obligations. In addition to the foregoing, Parent Guarantor subordinates all
of the rights referred to in this _Section 9.15(f)_ until the full and
indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Parent Guaranteed
Obligations.

  



  

   

95

 



    



  

(g) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
by the Company of any such right, remedy or power hereunder or thereunder
preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Each and
every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed to it
by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other,
and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time.

Parent Guarantor; (B) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent
Guarantor or by which any of Parent Guarantor's properties is bound or
affected; or (C) result in any violation or breach of, constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, impair Parent Guarantor's rights under, alter its obligations
or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to any
third party any rights of termination, amendment, payment, acceleration or
cancellation pursuant to, any Contract or permit of Parent Guarantor, except,
in each case, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent Guarantor to
perform its obligations hereunder;

Transactions and its guaranty is based solely on its independent
investigation of the financial condition of Parent and Merger Sub and is not
relying on any information furnished by the Company;

material inducement to the Company in entering into this Agreement.

communications under the Parent Guaranty shall be delivered in accordance with
_Section 9.4_ hereof.
