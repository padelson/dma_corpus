the sale of the Owned Real Property as a forward or reverse exchange thereof for other real property of a like-kind to be designated by the Sellers (including the ability to assign this Agreement to an entity established in order to effectuate such
exchange), with the result that the exchange shall qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section&nbsp;1031 of the Code, in which case Buyer shall execute any and all documents reasonably necessary to effect such exchange, as reasonably
approved by Buyer&#146;s counsel, and otherwise assist and cooperate with the Sellers in effecting such exchange, provided that: (a)&nbsp;any additional costs and expenses incurred by Buyer as a result of structuring such transaction as an exchange,
