Closing set forth in ARTICLE VI have been satisfied or waived (other than
conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date),
at the offices of Sirote and Permutt, PC, 2311 Highland Avenue South,

Closing shall be deemed to be

 



16  effective for accounting, tax and working capital purposes at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.5. Working Capital Adjustment.

 

(a) _Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) At least three (3) Business Days before the Closing, the Sellers shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement setting forth a good
faith estimate of Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), which statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) as of the
Closing Date and a calculation of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ ") prepared in accordance
with GAAP as used in the preparation of the Sample Working Capital
Statement, as modified by the Agreed Accounting Principles, and in a format
substantially similar to the Sample Working Capital Statement.

(ii) The " _Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital minus $18,422,000 (the " _Target Working Capital_
"). If the Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Share Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If the
Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Share Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount of the Closing Adjustment.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Sellers Representative a statement setting forth its
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, which statement shall contain an
internally-prepared balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) as of the Closing Date and a calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital (the " _Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ ") prepared in
accordance with GAAP as used in the preparation of the Sample Working Capital
Statement, as modified by the Agreed Accounting Principles, and in a
format substantially similar to the Sample Working Capital Statement.

(ii) The post-closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing Net
Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Post-
Closing Adjustment_ "). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number,
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) an
aggregate amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a negative number, then Buyer shall be entitled to receive such
amount from the Working Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. To the extent the amount owed to Buyer exceeds the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, the Sellers Representative shall pay to Buyer (on behalf of
the Sellers) the amount of such excess.

 

(iii) The Sellers Representative and Buyer hereby agree that, following the
final determination that any Post-Closing Adjustment is due and payable
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii) to Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, in either case,
the parties shall each cooperate with each other and shall use their
best efforts to take such action as is necessary to promptly provide to the
Escrow Agent such written direction as is necessary under the terms of the
Escrow Agreement to (A) release such portion of the Working Capital Escrowed
Amount as is necessary to satisfy the obligations of the parties pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(ii), and (B) following such satisfaction of the obligations of
the parties pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), to release 

 



17  the balance of the Working Capital Escrowed Amount, if any, to the Sellers
Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(c) _Examination and Review_.

 

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement,
the Sellers Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the " _Review
Period_ ") to review the Closing Net Working Capital Statement. During the
Review Period, the Sellers Representative and the Sellers accountants shall
have access to the books and records of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or
Buyers accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent
in Buyers possession) relating to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
as the Sellers Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and to prepare a
Statement of Objections (defined below), provided that such access shall be
in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the
Sellers Representative may object to the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement by delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth the
Sellers Representatives objections in reasonable detail, indicating each
disputed item or amount and the basis for the Sellers
Representatives disagreement therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ ").
If the Sellers Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Sellers Representative for and on behalf of the Sellers. If
the Sellers Representative delivers the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the " _Resolution Period_
"), and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-
Closing Adjustment and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement with such
changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative, shall be final and binding on all parties hereto.

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If the Sellers Representative and Buyer fail
to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (the " _Disputed Amounts_ ", and any amounts not
so disputed, the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution
to the office of McGladrey LLP or, if McGladrey LLP is unable to serve, Buyer
and the Sellers Representative shall appoint by mutual agreement the office
of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants other than the Sellers Representatives accountants or Buyers
accountants (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement. The parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of
values assigned to each such item in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

 



18 (iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. The Sellers Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers, shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants and Buyer shall pay the remaining one-half of the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountants.

 

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountants_. The Independent Accountants
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-
Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due (x) within
five (5) Business Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Net Working
Capital Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within five (5)
Business Days of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account(s) as shall be
directed by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, as the case may be.

(d) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.5
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price by the parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

qualified and that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from
federal income Taxes under Code §§401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the

under any Benefit Plan that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Sellers have in its or their possession and that are required to be executed
in order to be legally effective; and (v) copies of all resolutions adopted in
connection with any Benefit Plan, including, but not limited to, written board
consents or board meeting minutes containing the resolutions. Each Benefit
Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance with its
terms and any related documents or agreements in compliance with all
applicable Laws.

Benefit Plan: (i) is subject to the minimum funding standards of Section 302
of ERISA or Code §412; or (ii) is a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in

reports, summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions) have been
timely filed and/or distributed in accordance with the applicable requirements
of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Benefit Plan.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.19(f) of the Disclosure Schedules and

failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment
of the assets of any Benefit Plan.

maintained by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate,
there is no disqualified benefit that would, as defined in Section 4976(b) of
the Code, subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
to a Tax under Code §4976(a). The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has timely
complied with all duties imposed upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or

ARTICLE V

COVENANTS 

Section 5.1. Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. From the date hereof
through the Closing Date, or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to:
(a) conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business; and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
and preserve intact the current organization, business and franchise of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to preserve the rights, franchises, goodwill
and relationships of its Employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators
and others having business relationships with the Company and its
Subsidiaries. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, except as consented to
in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
take any action that would cause any of the changes, events or conditions
described in Section 3.8 to occur.

 

Section 5.2. Access to Information. From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (a) afford Buyer and

its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that any such investigation
shall be conducted during normal business hours upon reasonable advance
written notice to the Sellers Representative, under the supervision of the
Sellers Representatives designee(s) and in such a manner as not to
interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All
requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be submitted
or directed exclusively to the Sellers Representative or such other
individuals as the Sellers Representative may designate in writing from time
to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
the Sellers nor the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure would, in the Sellers
Representatives reasonable discretion: (x) cause significant competitive harm
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers

 



43  Representative shall make such information available to Buyer on an "outside
counsel only" basis; (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege; or
(z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof. Prior to the Closing, without the prior

perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the Real Property. Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or information provided
pursuant to this Section 5.2. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 5.2 will prevent, limit or in any way restrict the ability of
Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives from contacting any of their
respective customers or suppliers in the ordinary course of their respective
business or with respect to any matter other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

Section 5.3. Certain Notices; Supplement to Disclosure Schedules.

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, or the earlier termination
of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, the Sellers Representative or
the Company shall promptly notify Buyer (i) if the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes
or constitutes a breach of any of the Sellers representations and warranties
as of the date hereof, or if the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Seller becomes aware of the occurrence of any information, event, fact or
condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement),
with the passage of time or occurrence of an event or both, cause or
constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such information, event, fact or condition and (ii) of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of the Company or any of the Sellers
in this Agreement.

 

(b) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, or the earlier termination
of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, Buyer shall promptly notify the
Sellers Representative if Buyer becomes aware of any information, event, fact
or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Buyers
representations and warranties as of the date hereof, or if Buyer becomes
aware of the occurrence of any information, event, fact or condition that
would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute
a breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such
information, event, fact or condition. Between the date hereof and the
Closing, Buyer will also promptly notify the Sellers Representative of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Buyer in this Agreement.

(c) The Sellers Representative shall have the right to update the Disclosure
Schedules only with respect to any matter arising after the date hereof but
prior to the Closing that would result in the condition set forth in Section
6.2(b) not being satisfied, provided that the Sellers Representative
acknowledges concurrently with the delivery of such schedules that the matter
would result in such condition not being satisfied (the " _Updated Disclosure
Schedules_ "). If Buyer receives Updated Disclosure Schedules from the
Sellers Representative, Buyer shall have the right to (i) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or (ii) proceed with the Closing,
provided that upon the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all
claims, including all indemnity claims pursuant to ARTICLE VII, for all
matters set forth in the Updated Disclosure Schedules. For all other purposes
under this Agreement, the Updated Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
supersede and amend the original Disclosure Schedules dated as of the date
hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no Updated Disclosure Schedule

 



44  shall contain any matter that existed as of the date hereof, whether or not
known to any of the Sellers or the Company.

 

Section 5.4. Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on December 31,
2014 (or if earlier, the date of the employees termination of employment
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), Buyer shall and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide each Employee who remains employed
immediately after the Closing (" _Company Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i)
base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly
wages provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing; and (ii) welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing; provided that if the employment of a Company Continuing
Employee is terminated following the Closing and on or prior to the
date which is six (6) months from the Closing in a manner that would entitle
the Continuing Employee to receive severance payments or benefits pursuant to
Buyers current employee severance guidelines set forth in Section 5.4(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules (the " _Severance Guidelines_ "), Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company to, provide severance payments or benefits, as
applicable, to such terminated Company Continuing Employee in accordance with
the Severance Guidelines.

(b) The Company and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that Buyer sponsors a
Qualified Benefit Plan with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). The only period of
employment or service required under the Buyer 401(k) Plan is for purposes of
becoming eligible to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan and that period of
employment or service must be with Buyer or a member of its controlled group
subsequent to the Closing. Service with the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company prior to Closing will not satisfy such requirement.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan which is not a Qualified Benefit
Plan maintained by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit
Plans_ ") in which any Company Continuing Employees will participate effective
as of the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees
with the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service
were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any Buyer Benefit
Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Benefit Plan.

(d) This Section 5.4 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.4,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.4. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.4
shall not create any right in any Employee or any other Person to
any continued employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any
nature or kind whatsoever.

 

(e) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or Buyers or the Companys
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations with respect to health benefits otherwise applicable to Company
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Buyer or

 



45  any Subsidiary of Buyer that provides health benefits in which Company
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing,
other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees
as of the Closing Date under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the health Benefit
Plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during
the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health benefit plans
of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in
each case to the extent such Company Continuing Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer may require evidence of insurability for all optional
life insurance.

(f) From the date hereof until the Closing, Buyer shall not communicate with
any Company Continuing Employees, including, without limitation,
communications related to compensation, benefits or other treatment that they
will receive in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, unless
any such communications have been reviewed and approved by
Sellers Representative.

(g) No provision of this Section 5.4 shall (i) create any third party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create or be deemed to constitute
or create an employment Contract, (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute
an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (iv) limit the ability of
Buyer or any of the Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Company
Continuing Employee following the Closing.

 

(h) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
amend each 401(k) Plan of the Company to (i) permit participants who are
Company Continuing Employees to roll over their entire account balance
including an outstanding loan balance in kind to the Buyer 401(k) Plan once
the Company has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
regarding the termination of the 401(k) Plan of the Company; (ii) permit
participants who terminate their employment with the Company and the Buyer and
who are not in default on a loan to roll over their outstanding loan balance
to a plan of an employer unrelated to Buyer; (iii) provide that the only
forms of payment will be a single sum either paid directly to the participant
or as a rollover and override and eliminate language regarding irrevocable
commitments from an insurance company in the Plans termination provisions;
(iv) provide that anyone who does not elect a single sum payment either to the
participant or as a rollover will get an automatic rollover to an IRA; and (v)
provide that there will be no new loans made to participants (however current
loans can continue to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the respective
loans).

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate each Employee Pension Benefit Plan of the Company, including any
401(k) Plan of the Company. The effective date of the termination of each such
Employee Pension Benefit Plan shall be no later than the day prior to the
Closing Date, with employer and employee contributions being discontinued at
least one day prior to the effective date of such termination, and shall be
evidenced by delivery to Buyer of 

 



46  the resolutions and other documents contemplated by Section 2.3(d)(x).
Sellers shall cause the Company to take action to cease all employer and
employee contributions to each Employee Pension Benefit Plan, including any
401(k) Plan of the Company, for all periods on and after the termination of
such Employee Pension Benefit Plan. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, the Company, at the Sellers expense, will prepare and file with the
IRS an Application for Determination for Terminating Plan on Form 5310, and,
if necessary in the reasonable opinion of Buyers counsel, a submission to the
IRS under the Voluntary Correction Program with Service Approval portion of
the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System with respect to any Qualified
Benefit Plan of the Company, and prepare and file all other information
required to be submitted in connection therewith, in accordance with
applicable IRS requirements, including requirements concerning Notices to
Interested Parties. The Company will provide the Sellers with a reasonable
opportunity to review the filings before making such filings. The Company will
cause proper administration of such Qualified Benefit Plan or Plans, as the
case may be, to continue during the pendency of the IRS determination request,
and will take all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to obtain
a favorable determination letter from the IRS. Upon receipt of a favorable
determination letter, the Company will oversee termination distributions from
such Qualified Benefit Plan or Plans, as the case may be, in accordance with
the terms of such Qualified Benefit Plan or Plans, as the case may
be. Sellers will provide such cooperation and assistance to Buyer as Buyer
may reasonably request with respect to foregoing matters. The Company will
perform its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4(i) at the Sellers sole
cost and expense.

Section 5.5. Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries now existing in favor of
each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in the Organizational Documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof and
disclosed in Section 5.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may, and Buyer may cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
amend or modify the Companys and its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents
to the extent required by Law or in any other manner that does not affect any
right to or ability to seek advancement of defense costs, or the application
of the exculpatory or indemnification provisions contained therein to the
acts or omissions of any such individuals prior to the Closing.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date, if available, the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date (provided that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Closing Date "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date
with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). 

 



47 (c) The parties hereto expressly agreed that the directors and officers to
whom this Section 5.5 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.5, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.5.

 

Section 5.6. Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this Section
5.6 shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 

Section 5.7. Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all Consents from
all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
performance of their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder. Each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other
parties and their respective Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such
Consents; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.7(a) shall
require any party to incur any obligation or expense that is not expressly
provided for by this Agreement or any Transaction Document. The parties hereto
shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required Consents. If required by
the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been
filed prior to the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Buyers undertaking pursuant to this
Section 5.7, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible, including reasonable
best efforts to contest the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying
or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that Buyer shall not be required to
commence or defend any legal proceeding or to divest, dispose of or hold
separate any assets to secure clearance or approval under the applicable
antitrust Laws.

 

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Buyer, any Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of their respective
businesses, or any disclosure which is not permitted by Law) shall be
disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission
or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals. Each party shall give written notice

 



48  to the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or
contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such written notice being sufficient to provide
the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

 

(d) The Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give
all notices to, and obtain all Consents from, all third parties that are
described in Section 3.5 and Section 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedules;
_provided_ , _however_ _,_ that (i) none of Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom
Consent is requested and (ii) nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be deemed to
affect or in any limit the rights of Buyer pursuant to Section 6.2(g).

 

Section 5.8. Books and Records.

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.6 and Section 5.12(d), in order to facilitate the
resolution of any claims made against or incurred by the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement or any Transaction Documents following the Closing, for a
period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of the Sellers
reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Sellers collective
expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and
records.

 

(b) Buyer shall not be obligated to provide the other party with access to any
books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to this Section 5.8
where such access would violate any Law.

Section 5.9. Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing,
subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the
closing conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof.

Section 5.10. Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of
counsel), (a) no party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements
in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (b) the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of
any such announcement.

 

Section 5.11. Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances,
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

 



49 Section 5.12. Tax Matters.

 

(a) The Sellers shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify, defend, save and
hold harmless Buyer (and, following the Closing, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries) from any Losses attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the nonpayment
thereof) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) all Taxes arising from the joint Section 338(h)(10) Election;
(iii) all Taxes under Code §1374 for the Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iv) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
of which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
or current or former Affiliate of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on
or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law), (v) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring on or before the Closing, (vi)
all Taxes related to the Owned Real Property and (vii) any and all Straddle
Tax Period Taxes allocable to Company and each of its Subsidiaries for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period, the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined (i) in accordance with the
joint Section 338(h)(10) Election, or (ii) based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other
Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Tax Period
that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Tax Period.

 

(c) The Sellers will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to
be filed, any Tax Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including Straddle Tax Periods, ending on the Closing
Date. Buyer will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, any Tax Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for other
Straddle Tax Periods. With respect to Tax Returns to be prepared by the
Sellers or the Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.12(c), (i) except as required
by applicable Law, such Tax Returns will be filed in a manner consistent with
past practice and no position will be taken, election made or method adopted
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior
periods in filing such Tax Returns, (ii) the party preparing such a Tax Return
will provide a copy of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days before it is
due, taking into consideration extensions of time to file, to the other party
for review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (iii) for each Tax Return, each party will remit
payment to the filing party the appropriate share of Taxes owed (if any) by
the remitting party no later than five (5) days prior to the due date of
filing each such Tax Return.

 

(d) Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 5.12 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to a period of time prior to the
Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis, at a reasonable cost to
requesting party, to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Company agrees to (i) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until

 



50  the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Buyer, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority, and (ii) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.

(e) Buyer, the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries) and
the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

(f) Buyer and the Sellers agree, upon request, to promptly provide the other
party with all information that either Party may be required to report
pursuant to Code §6043 or 6043A, or Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 

(g) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(h) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, shall
be borne by the Sellers.

 

(i) Neither any Seller nor the Company (whether on behalf of itself and or any
Q-Sub) will take any action that would cause the Company or any Q-Sub to no

_Restrictive Covenants_ "), Buyer shall have the right and remedy to seek to
have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any court having
jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or
threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and its Affiliates
and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer and its
Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 5.16 shall be construed to limit the right
of Buyer to collect money damages in the event of a breach of the Restrictive
Covenants. In addition to the remedies Buyer may seek and obtain pursuant to
this Section 5.16, the Term shall be extended by and all periods during which
any Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be found by a court of competent

Law, not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to
the portions which have been declared invalid or unenforceable.

(h) If any Governmental Authority determines that any of the Restrictive
Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or
geographic scope of such provision, it is the intention of the parties that
such Governmental Authority shall have the power to modify any such provision,
to the extent necessary to render the provision enforceable, and such
provision as so modified shall be enforced.

expressly accepts and assumes the risk of facts being other than or different
from the assumptions and perceptions as of any date prior to and including
the Closing Date, and agrees that this release shall be in all respects
effective and shall not be subject to termination or rescission by reason of
any such difference in facts.

 

(e) The release provided under this Section 5.17 shall extend to and be

only an aggregate amount up to (but not exceeding) $500,000 of any such
bonuses or other incentive compensation paid (whether paid before, on or after
March 31, 2015) that relates to the fiscal year of Buyer ending March 31,
2015 shall be credited to and applied toward the satisfaction of the
Continuing Employee Pool Amount; (ii) any severance paid any Continuing
Company Employee during, or that relates to, the period commencing on the

during the Measuring Period, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) terminates the employment of any Company Continuing Employee that
received a Restricted Stock Award without "Cause" (as defined in the Buyer
LTIP), then Buyer shall subsequently grant or award the restricted stock
included in such Company Continuing Employees Restricted Stock Award to
another Company Continuing Employee, and such subsequent grant or award shall
(x) be deemed to have been granted or awarded pursuant to this Section 5.19
but (y) not be credited to and applied toward the satisfaction of the
Continuing Employee Pool Amount (provided that the original Restricted Stock
Award relating to the Company Continuing Employee whose employment was so
terminated will remain credited to and applied toward the satisfaction of
the Continuing Employee Pool Amount), in each case subject to the terms of
this Section 5.19. In furtherance of the foregoing, if, at any time during the
Measuring Period and with respect to any Company Continuing Employee that was
awarded or granted a Restricted Stock Award, the employment of such Company
Continuing Employee with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) is terminated either by (i) such Company Continuing Employee for any
reason or (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) for
"Cause" (as defined in the Buyer LTIP), then, in either case, Buyer shall not
be required to grant or award such Company Continuing Employees Restricted
Stock Award to any other Person, and the Restricted Stock Award to such
Company Continuing Employee shall be deemed to have been granted or awarded
pursuant to this Section 5.19, and shall be credited to and applied toward the
satisfaction of the Continuing Employee Pool Amount.

related activities with respect to the Owned Real Property located at 3300 1st
Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama in accordance with the terms of the

the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Sellers will be responsible for,
and will pay, all amounts reflected in the final AIA Document G703 project

30, 2014, are attached to Section 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedules), such
final project schedule to be dated as of a date within five (5) Business Days
of the Closing and included in the Updated Disclosure Schedules, for the

following the Closing); provided that such final project schedule shall not
include an amount that is less than $2,413,087, or, if such final project
schedule includes an amount that is less than $2,413,087, Sellers will be
responsible for the difference between $2,413,087 and such lower amount set
forth on such final project schedule. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to effect an assignment by The Robinson Real Estate Company, LLC to, and
assumption by, the Company, as of the Closing Date, of that certain Standard
Form of Agreement (AIA Document B105-2007), dated June 19, 2013, between The

apply) or Section 7.3(a) exceeds $1,025,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for
Losses in excess of the Deductible.

 

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to Section 7.2(a) (other than with respect to an
inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental Representations, for which the
following limitation shall not apply) or Section 7.3(a), as the case may be,
shall not exceed $17,500,000 (the " _Maximum Indemnification Amount_ "). 

(c) For purposes of this ARTICLE VII, Losses shall be computed net of (i) any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party (net of
collection costs and increases in premiums) and (ii) any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified
Party from a third party in respect of any such claim. The Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies
or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(d) The amount of any Losses pursuant to this ARTICLE VII will be reduced by
the amount of any income Tax benefit actually received by any Buyer
Indemnified Party that arises directly from the incurrence or payment of the
Loss associated with the applicable indemnity claim. Any indemnity payment
hereunder will initially be made without regard to any income Tax benefit and
will be reduced to reflect any such income Tax benefit only after such Buyer
Indemnified Party has actually realized such benefit. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Buyer Indemnified Party will have "actually realized" an income
Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes paid
by such Buyer Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that such
Buyer Indemnified Party would have

 



60  been required to pay but for the incurrence or payment of such Loss;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in computing the amount of any such income Tax
benefit, the Buyer Indemnified Party will be deemed to recognize all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. In the event
that there is a subsequent disallowance (in whole or in part) of any income
Tax benefit by any Governmental Authority, then the Sellers will promptly pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Buyer Indemnified Party the amount of such
disallowed income Tax benefit.

 

(e) For purposes of this ARTICLE VII, Losses shall not include any (i)
punitive damages (unless, and only to the extent, that such damages are
awarded to a third party in a Third Party Claim, in which case such damages
shall not be excluded from Losses), (ii) damages to the extent based on
diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple or (iii)
consequential damages.

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of
any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give
rise thereto.

(g) In no event shall any party have any obligation or liability under this
ARTICLE VII to the extent arising from or relating to, directly or indirectly,
(i) any Law not adopted as of the Closing Date or that is adopted following
the Closing Date but that takes effect retroactively to a date that is prior
to the Closing Date, or (ii) any increase in any applicable Tax rate that is
not adopted as of the Closing Date or that is adopted following the Closing
Date but that takes effect retroactively to a date that is prior to the
Closing Date.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the same Loss be taken into account more than once for
purposes of calculations in connection with, or application of, the Deductible
or the Maximum Indemnification Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not, and shall not be construed to, limit (i) any Indemnified
Partys ability to assert multiple bases for any individual claim under this
Agreement with respect to the same event or state of facts in any notice given
by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.5 and
(ii) any Indemnified Partys claims with respect to any different event or
state of facts or recovery therefor pursuant to this ARTICLE VII.

 

(i) For purposes of this ARTICLE VII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and the amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, will be determined
without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty.

(j) None of the limitations set forth in this Section 7.4 will apply to
Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of common law
fraud, criminal activity or the intentional misrepresentation of the Sellers.

 

(k) No Losses may be claimed under Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 by any
Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses are actually included in the
final Closing Net Working Capital Statement pursuant to Section 2.5.

 



61 Section 7.5. Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The
failure to give such reasonably prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense;  _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is any Seller, neither such
Indemnifying Party nor the Sellers Representative (on behalf of such Seller)
will have the right to assume or direct the defense of any such Third Party
Claim: (i) that is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a
supplier or customer of the Business, (ii) seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (iii) if the Indemnifying
Party, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, does not have the
financial resources, or is not able, to satisfy the amount of such Third Party
Claim, (iv) if the Third Party Claim, or the Indemnifying Partys defense or
direction of the defense thereof, would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (v) unless the
Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing to be fully responsible for all
Losses relating to such Third Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 7.5(b),
it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 7.5(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section 5.6)
records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as provided in this
Section 7.5(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim without
leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall
give written notice to that effect to the

 



62  Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section
7.5(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such reasonably prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.6. Indemnity Escrowed Amount.

 

(a) To partially secure the obligations of the Sellers arising under this
ARTICLE VII, at the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Indemnity Escrowed
Amount with the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and Section 2.3(a) hereof. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity
Escrowed Amount for the duration of the term of the Escrow Agreement, to
be administered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) The Sellers Representative hereby agrees that, following the final
determination that any indemnification is due and payable to Buyer under this
ARTICLE VII, the Sellers Representative shall cooperate with Buyer and shall
use its best efforts to take such action as is necessary to promptly provide
to the Escrow Agent such written direction as is necessary under the terms of
the Escrow Agreement to release such portion of the Indemnity Escrowed Amount
as is necessary to satisfy such indemnifiable Losses of Buyer.

 

Section 7.7. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Share Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 



63 Section 7.8. Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 9.10, the
parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from common law
fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 5.12
or this ARTICLE VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other
parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in Section 5.12 or this ARTICLE VII.
Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain
any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any
remedy on account of common law fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct
by any party hereto.

 

Section 7.9. Contribution and Waiver. From and after the Closing, no Seller
shall seek indemnification or contribution from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including by reason of the fact that such Seller was a director,
manager, officer, employee or agent of any such entity or was serving at the
request of any such entity as a partner, trustee, director, manager, officer,
employee or agent of another entity) for any breaches of this Agreement of any
Transaction Document or in respect of any other payments required to made by
any Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

Dead Date_ "); or

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 shall not

(i) none of the Sellers are then in material breach of any provision of this

cured prior to the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days following receipt of
notice of such breach or failure and (B) the Drop Dead Date; or

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 shall not
have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date, unless such failure shall be due

agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing; or

 

(d) by Buyer or the Sellers Representative in the event that:

 

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions

which provisions will survive termination and remain in full force and effect
without any limitation whatsoever; and

Section 9.4. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,

assignment will not release Buyer from any liability or obligation under this

 



66  Agreement) or (b) collaterally assign all or any portion of its rights under

lenders.

 

Section 9.7. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.5,

Section 9.12. Sellers Representative.

 

(a) In order to efficiently administer (i) the payment of the Purchase Price,
(ii) the resolution of disputes relating to any Disputed Amounts, (iii) the
defense and/or settlement of any indemnity claims of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to ARTICLE VII, and (iv) the Escrowed Amount and the Escrow
Agreement, the Sellers Representative is hereby designated by, and agrees to
act as the representative of, the Sellers.

(b) By approving this Agreement and/or accepting their proportionate share
of the Closing Date Share Purchase Price Payment and the Closing Date Owned
Real Property Purchase Price Payment, each Seller hereby constitutes, and the
Sellers collectively constitute, the Sellers Representative as their agent,
proxy, and true and lawful attorney in fact for purposes of, and with full
authority on the behalf of each of them: (i) to receive payment of and to
allocate the Purchase Price; (ii) to make all decisions relating to the
resolution of disputes relating to any Disputed Amounts; (iii) to take all
action necessary in connection with the defense and/or settlement of any
indemnity claims of any Indemnified Party pursuant to ARTICLE VII; (iv) to
give and receive all notices required to be given to the Sellers under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (v) to amend this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.8 and to deliver any Updated Disclosure Schedules pursuant to
Section 5.3, and (vi) to take any and all additional action as is
contemplated to be taken by the Sellers Representative or on behalf of the
Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Each
Seller agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers Representative and
shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of
any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Sellers Representative (to the
extent authorized by and in accordance with this Agreement) shall be binding
upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Sellers Representative
shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts, consultants and other
advisors as he shall deem necessary in connection with exercising his powers
and performing his functions hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the
part of the Sellers Representative) shall, solely as to the Sellers, be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such persons.

(c) In the event that the Sellers Representative becomes unable to perform
his responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, another Person
designated by a majority in interest of the Sellers in writing to Buyer shall
be deemed to be the Sellers Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.

(d) Buyer has the right to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions of the Sellers Representative as to the settlement of any
claims for indemnification by Buyer pursuant to ARTICLE VII, or any other
actions required to be taken by the Sellers Representative hereunder, and no
party hereunder will have any Action against Buyer for any action taken by
Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Sellers
Representatives.

 

(e) Each of the Sellers shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers Representative from and against any loss, cost, damage,
claim or expense (including attorneys fees) which may be incurred by Sellers
Representative arising out of or relating to the performance of his duties and
obligations as the Sellers Representative hereunder or under the Transaction
Documents,

 



68  except to the extent as the consequence of fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Sellers Representative.

 

(f) The Sellers Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in respect of amounts
received on behalf of such Seller. The Sellers Representative shall not be
liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by the Sellers
Representative or any agent employed by the Sellers Representative hereunder
or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that
the Sellers Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by
law for willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative shall not be liable
to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the
Sellers Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled. The Sellers Representative shall not be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance
of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the
Sellers Representative nor any agent employed by the Sellers Representative
shall incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure of the
Sellers Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of the Sellers
Representatives duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or bad faith.

Section 9.13. Disclosure Schedules. The disclosures in the
Disclosure Schedules, with respect to a particular representation and
warranty, and those in any Updated Disclosure Schedule, shall be considered a
disclosure for purposes of any other representation and warranty in this
Agreement for which such disclosure would be readily apparent.

Section 9.14. Tax-Deferred Exchange; Cooperation. The Sellers shall have the
right to structure the sale of the Owned Real Property as a forward or
reverse exchange thereof for other real property of a like-kind to be
designated by the Sellers (including the ability to assign this Agreement to
an entity established in order to effectuate such exchange), with the result
that the exchange shall qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under
Section 1031 of the Code, in which case Buyer shall execute any and all
documents reasonably necessary to effect such exchange, as
reasonably approved by Buyers counsel, and otherwise assist and cooperate
with the Sellers in effecting such exchange, provided that: (a) any additional
costs and expenses incurred by Buyer as a result of structuring such
transaction as an exchange, as opposed to an outright sale, shall be borne by
