as of November 5, 2009, among IMS Health Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Healthcare Technology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Healthcare Technology Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
," with the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "),
acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a committee of the Company Board
consisting only of independent directors of the Company (the " _Transaction
Committee_ "), and the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger
Sub have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, TPG Partners V, L.P., TPG Partners VI, L.P. and CPP Investment
Board Private Holdings Inc. (the " _Guarantors_ ") are each entering into a
limited guarantee in favor of the Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") pursuant to
which the Guarantors are severally guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  

# 

  

# _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

  

# 

  

1.1. _The Merger_.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

  



  

1.2. _Closing_.  Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the second business day (the "
_Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be

        
   

  



  

satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions),
then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) any
business day before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by
Parent on no less than three business days prior notice to the Company and
(b) the final day of the Marketing Period, or such other date, time, or place
as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. For purposes of
this Agreement, (a) the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day
other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York, (b) the term " _Marketing
Period_ " shall mean the first period of 35 consecutive days after the date
of this Agreement, beginning on the later of (i) delivery of the Required
Bank Information (together with the authorization letter referred to in
Section 6.14(b)(viii)) and (ii) 14 days after the date of the later of the
meetings with Moodys Investor Services and Standard and Poors Ratings Group,
a division of The McGraw Hill Corporation with respect to the debt facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, throughout which (i) Parent shall
have the Required Bank Information and (ii) the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 have been satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at Closing) and nothing has occurred and no condition
exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to
fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time
during such 35-day period; _provided_ that the days from and including
November 23, 2009 to and including November 27, 2009 shall not be included
in determining such 35-day requirement; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to December 18, 2009,
the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than January 5, 2010;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably
believe it has delivered the Required Bank Information, it may deliver to
Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed
such delivery), in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date of such notice unless Parent in good faith reasonably
believes the Company has not completed delivery of the Required Bank
Information and, within four business days after the delivery of such notice
by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect
(stating with specificity which Required Bank Information the Company has not
delivered); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the "Marketing Period" shall be
deemed not to have commenced if, prior to the completion of such 35-day
period, any of the following events shall have occurred: (i)
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any of the financial statements contained in the Company Reports,
(ii) the Company shall have publicly announced any intention to restate any
material financial information included in the Required Bank Information or
that any such restatement is under consideration, in which case the Marketing
Period shall be deemed not to commence at the earliest unless and until such
restatement has been completed and the Company Reports have been amended or
the Company has determined that no restatement shall be required, or (iii)
the Company shall have been delinquent in filing any material report with the
SEC required under the Exchange Act, in which case the Marketing Period shall
be deemed not to commence at the earliest unless and until such delinquency
is cured; and _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding any
of the foregoing, if the financial statements included in the Required Bank

  



        
   

  



  

Information that are available to Parent and Merger Sub on the first day of
any such 35-day period would be required to be updated pursuant to Rule 3-12
of Regulation S-X on any day during such 35-day period if a registration
statement using such financial statements were to be filed with the SEC on
such date, then a new 35-day period shall commence; it being understood and
agreed that on and after February 12, 2010, the Marketing Period shall be
deemed not to commence unless the Company has delivered to Parent and Merger
Sub audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at and for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2009 of the
type otherwise required in the Required Bank Information.

  



  

1.3. _Effective Time_.  As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or at such later date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

# _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  

# 

  

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ")
shall be amended in its entirety to be in the form of (except with respect to
the name of the Company) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub,
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 6.11).

  



  

2.2. _The Bylaws_.  At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") shall be amended in their entirety to be in
the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the bylaws of
Merger Sub, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to Section 6.11).

  



  

ARTICLE III

# 

  

3.1. _Directors_.  The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time

Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  



  

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed

ARTICLE IV

  

# 

  

# _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates_

  

# 

  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

  



  

### (a) _Merger Consideration_. Except as provided in Section 4.1(d), each
share (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties, and (ii) Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are owned
by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares (each Share referred to
in clause (i) or clause (ii) above being an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to
receive $22.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest. Except as provided in Section 4.1(d), at the Effective Time, all of
the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing
any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number
of such Shares, without interest.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in
Section 4.1(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(ii), by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any Dissenting
Shares to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f)
with respect to such Dissenting Shares. As used in this Article IV, the term
" _Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_.  At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Shares Owned by Subsidiaries_. Any Share owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and shall, at the
election of Parent, either: (i) convert into one share of a class of stock of
the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger,
or (ii) be treated as an Excluded Share pursuant to Sections 4.1(a) and (b)
hereof.

  



        
   

  



  

4.2. _Payment_.

  

### 

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_.  At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of
Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make the aggregate payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").  If a Dissenting
Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its, appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the
Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively,
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in
money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable
under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation.
 To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section
4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make such aggregate payments under Section 4.1(a).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Payment Procedures_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly (and in any event within two
business days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares to the extent such Record Holder does not also hold Shares
that are not Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal for use in collecting
the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger,
such letter of transmittal to be in such customary form as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal
by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed
and signed in accordance with its instructions, and surrender of the
Certificate (if any) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)), such Record Holder shall be entitled to receive a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the number of such Shares multiplied by
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and, if applicable, the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable as provided above. Risk of loss of and title to
any Certificate will pass only upon proper delivery as provided above. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not

  



        
   

  



  

#### registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above may be
issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal is
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (x)
if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing
Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to number of
Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration (such
amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (y) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
am (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominee on the first business day after the Closing Date an amount in
cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Transfers_.  From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, any Person presents to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
Paying Agent any Certificates or any transfer instructions relating to Shares
cancelled in the Merger, such Person shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in Section 4.2(b)(i) and told to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to
which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares upon compliance with the
instructions in the form of letter of transmittal referred to in Section
4.2(b)(i), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount equal to the

  



         
 

  



  

### number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Dissenting Shares_.  No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such
Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to
appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and
until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Dissenting Stockholders right to appraisal under the DGCL with respect to
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company relating to Company stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Withholding Rights_.  Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable in respect of Shares cancelled in the Merger
such amounts as it reasonably believes it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Record Holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

  

### 

  

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

thereof, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a

holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three business days after the
Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to the Company SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time _times_ (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under such Company
SAR, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment.

  



  

(c) _Performance Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding performance restricted stock unit (a " _Performance RSU_ ")
granted under a Stock Plan, shall, except as otherwise provided in Section
6.1(f) of this Agreement, fully vest and shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than three business days after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject

holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three business days after the

of Shares subject to such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _times_
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.

  



  

(e) _Company Awards_.  At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans, other than Company Options, Performance RSUs, RSUs and Company
SARs (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall fully vest and be converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and, to the extent applicable, assuming target levels of
achievement under the respective award agreement and the Stock Plan) _times_
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for
payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a specified reference
price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration
exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment. Payment of Company Awards shall be made in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan.

  



  

### (f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the Company Board and the human resources committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions to implement the provisions of Sections
4.3(a)-(e). As of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions

equity and equity-based awards granted under any Stock Plan shall be
cancelled or terminated and that, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder of any such award, such

  



        
   

  



  

### holder shall have the right only to receive a cash payment based on

terminated in accordance with their terms at the Effective Time, the Company
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions reasonably required so
that each such Company Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

### 

  

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so

Employees working outside of the United States (such plans hereinafter being
referred to collectively as " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), are listed on
Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and each Benefit Plan
which has received a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service National Office or a favorable determination letter as to its

letter received with respect to each such Benefit Plan. True and complete
copies of all Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule have been made available to Parent.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) To the Knowledge of the Company, each Benefit Plan, other than
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _U.S. Benefit Plans_ ") is in
material compliance with its terms and with ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws. Each U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an "
_ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter under Section 401(b) of the Code within the
applicable remedial amendment period, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such ERISA
Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such
transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or

  



        
   

  



  

#### any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) No U.S. Benefit Plan is a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries
nor any member of their "ERISA Affiliates" (as defined below) has at any time
sponsored or contributed to, or has or had any liability or obligation in
respect of, any multiemployer plan that would reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is
reasonably expected to incur any material liability under Subtitle C or D of
Title IV of ERISA (as defined below) with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-
employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with the Company
under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA
Affiliate_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (v) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit
Plans, other than routine claims for benefits. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any material obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any Benefit Plan.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the approval of the Merger
by the stockholders of the Company nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event
(s)) will (A) entitle any Employee to severance pay or any material increase
in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof,
(B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the
Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans, or (D) shall
constitute a triggering event under any Benefit Plan which would result in
any material payment which would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as
such term is defined in Code Section 280G(b)(1)) to any present or former
employee, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 5.1(h)(vi) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a good faith estimate of the amount of (by
Benefit Plan, type of agreement or type of payment) contributions required to
be made as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement into any rabbi trust.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the trustees of any
Foreign Pension Plan (as defined below) located in the United Kingdom nor The
Pensions Regulator (as defined in the Pensions Act of 2004, as amended, the "
_The Pensions Regulator_ ") have initiated any contribution notice or other
proceeding, or asserted any rights to a financial support direction or
notified the Company of its intent to issue a contribution notice or
financial support direction or renegotiate an existing funding

  



        
   

  



  

#### agreement with respect to such Foreign Pension Plan, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no disputes and no reason to believe that
agreement will not be reached on a mutually acceptable basis between the
trustees and the Company in relation to any schedule of contributions,
recovery plan or statement of funding principles in relation to any actuarial
valuation which may currently be under consideration without recourse to the
Pensions Regulator. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Foreign Pension Plan_
" means a Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan with respect to
employees located outside of the United States.

  

#### 

  

#### (viii) With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, (A) if required to be
funded, the assets of each such Foreign Pension Plan are sufficient under
applicable local Law to provide for the payment of such benefits in full, or
(B) if not required to be funded, the book reserves (determined in accordance
with GAAP) are sufficient to provide for the payment of benefits, except, in
each case, as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to any Foreign Pension Plan, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give rise to a
material liability or obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries to make
any contributions to such Foreign Pension Plan or otherwise increase
or accelerate any material liabilities under any such plan or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, be likely to cause the trustees of any such Foreign
Pension Plan to materially change or alter their investment policy.

  

#### 

  

#### (ix) Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with
applicable Law. All material Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Schedule
5.1(h)(ix) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

#### 

  

#### (x) The Company has provided Parent copies of all material written terms

contemplated by this Agreement. Except as would not reasonably be expected

no pending charge or complaint against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Entity
and (vi) the Company has complied with all Laws regarding employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours

contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal involving more
than 50% of the total voting power of the capital stock, or more than 50% of
the consolidated assets, of the Company that the Company Board has determined
in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in

financial aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

### (e) Except as set forth in this Section 6.2(e), the Company Board shall
not:

  

###

Proposal; or

Company Board may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation or fail
to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made
after the date hereof, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ") and may also take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of
this Agreement; _provided_ that in the case of any Change in
Recommendation that is the result of a Superior Proposal or action pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement:

  



  

(A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least three calendar days in advance, of its intention to effect a
Change of Recommendation or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a), which
notice shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal
and the material terms thereof;

  



  

(B) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or taking such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a), the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and
Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would permit the Company not to effect a Change of
Recommendation or take such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in response to
such a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(C) the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantees offered
in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be
given effect.

  



  

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.2(e) with respect to
such new written notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice
shall be reduced to one calendar day before the Change of Recommendation or
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (rather than the three calendar days
otherwise contemplated by Section 6.2(e)). None of the Company Board, any
committee thereof or the Company itself shall enter into any binding
agreement with any Person to limit or not give prior notice to Parent and

  



        
   

  



  

Merger Sub of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or to
terminate this Agreement, in each case, in light of a Superior Proposal.

  



  

### (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-

Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company).

Representatives including, in connection with such notice, a written summary
of the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers that are not
made in writing and copies of any requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements, of proposals or offers that are made in writing. From

of the status and terms of any proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any discussions, negotiations or developments,

definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC staff

#### 

  

#### (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or
enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination, judgment, investigation or Law that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale,
disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or
businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect
thereto) if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any investigation or proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance
or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that would materially delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity; provided, that, with

consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a
bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section
6.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, that, with respect to any Antitrust Law other than

notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the

records

  



        
   

  



  

and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that
no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company
(i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the

trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
to disclose any information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
would in the reasonable judgment of the Company waive the protection of
attorney-client privilege if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege, or (iii) to disclose any sensitive or personal information that
would expose the Company to the risk of liability. Without limiting the
generality of this Section 6.6, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time (or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms), the Company will furnish to Parent promptly after becoming
available, monthly financial statements including an unaudited balance sheet,
income statement and statement of cash flows for each month through the
Closing Date as well as any update of its outlook for the quarter or the
balance of the fiscal year as it may prepare for managements internal use.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, that notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent may provide such information to potential sources of
capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during
syndication of the Available Financing subject to the execution of customary
confidentiality agreements with such Persons regarding such information, with
the Company being named as an express third party beneficiary with rights of
enforcement under such confidentiality agreements.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting
such party of any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any

other party.

Recommendation has occurred or in connection with Section 6.2(f)) the Company
and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the

  



        
   

  



  

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity.

  



  

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

### (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the eighteenth month anniversary of the Effective Time,
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be provided with (i) base salary or wage rate and annual bonus
opportunities which are no less than the base salary and bonus opportunities
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) pension and welfare and fringe benefits and perquisites
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the practice,
program or arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to such employees.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in to take into
account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual thereunder (other than for benefit accruals under defined benefit
pension plans), service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company (except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits).

  

### 

  

### (c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, with respect to any
employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the employees, Parent
will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) cause there to be waived
any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or waiting
period requirements to the same extent waived under comparable plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts
paid by such employees during the calendar year in which Effective Time
occurs under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any
successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and
its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements identified in Section

such agreements and giving effect to the terms set forth in Section 6.1(e)
and (f) of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will pay each
participant in the Company Executive Annual Incentive Plan, excluding the
Company Performance Restricted Stock Incentive Plan thereunder (the "
_Bonus Plan_ "), who remains employed through the Effective Time for the year
in which the Effective Time occurs, a cash amount equal to the product of (x)
the annual bonus award earned by participants for the year in

  



         
 

  



  

### which the Effective Time occurs under the Bonus Plan (assuming a full
year of performance) that is based upon actual performance as reasonably
determined by the Company, if the Closing occurs in 2009, and
target performance, if the Closing occurs in 2010 and (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in the plan year from
the commencement of the plan year until the date on which the Effective Time
occurs and the denominator of which is 365, _provided_ , however, such pro
rata bonus will not be paid to any employee who does not agree in writing to
a corresponding reduction of any pro rata bonus entitlement due to the
employee in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under an
employment agreement, change in control agreement or other Benefit Plan,
which provides for payment of pro rata bonus upon an involuntary termination.
Following the payment of pro rata bonuses as provided in the preceding
sentence (the " _Pro Rata Bonus_ "), Parent will cause the Company to (A)
maintain a bonus plan for the remainder of the year in which the Effective
Time occurs on the same terms and conditions and pursuant to the same targets
and performance measures as were in effect for such entire year and (B) pay
bonuses within two and a half months following the end of such year in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the annual bonus that was earned
by the participants for the calendar year under the bonus plan described in
clause (A) above taking into account the entire calendar year over (ii) any
Pro Rata Bonus previously paid in respect of such year (but not below zero).
 If the Effective Time occurs in 2010, the Company shall be permitted, prior
to the Effective Time, (I) to pay annual bonuses for 2009 in an amount equal
to the annual bonus earned by participants for the 2009 calendar year in
accordance with the terms of the Bonus Plan, (II) calculate performance of
PERS awards granted with respect to 2009 based on performance through 2009
and (III) subject to prior consultation with Parent, establish bonus targets,
maximums and performance goals under the Bonus Plan for 2010 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and otherwise consistent
with the management plan presented to Parent on October 6, 2009.

  

### 

  

### (f) If the Effective Time occurs in 2010, the Company shall be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time, to calculate performance under the Companys
Long Term Incentive Program for the period ending in 2009 based on the
performance through 2009.

  

### 

  

### (g) To the extent the payout of awards under the Long Term Incentive
Program with respect to the 2009-2010 performance cycle (or if the Effective
Time occurs in 2009, with respect to the 2008-2009 performance cycle) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are at
a level which is less than the maximum amount with respect to such awards,
the Company shall be permitted, with Parents consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, to implement a mechanism to permit employees to
earn up to the maximum amount based on the Companys actual performance over
the remainder of the existing performance period, subject to their
continued employment; _provided_ that any amounts that are earned in
connection with the remainder of the performance period shall only be paid to
plan participants in cash.

  

### 

  

### (h) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall establish and
fund (in accordance with the terms of the underlying plans) the rabbi trusts
that are contemplated by the Benefit Plans. The Company shall provide Parent
with copies of all documentation related to such rabbi trusts and shall give
Parent the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such
documentation prior to the adoption thereof. The Company agrees to take all
actions and seek all approvals that are necessary to consent to
any amendments to any employment or

  



        
   

  



  

### change in control agreements or Benefit Plans that are negotiated by
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and Parent with respect to the
funding of any obligation thereunder, including without limitation, any rabbi
trust.

  

### 

  

### (i) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" within the meaning of each Benefit Plan will occur upon
the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (j) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary,
no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does (i) prohibit the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates from amending or terminating
any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (ii)
require the Surviving Corporation to keep any person employed for any period
of time, or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment
to, any Benefit Plan, and no person participating in any such Benefit Plan
maintained by either the Company or Parent shall have any claim or cause of
action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provisions of this
Agreement as it relates to any such Benefit Plan or otherwise.

  

### 

  

6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except (a) Parent shall reimburse the Company

fee for the Proxy Statement and printing and mailing the Proxy Statement, (b)
Parents reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b), (c)
Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b) and (d)
Parents reimbursement and indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
6.14(d);  _provided_ , that (x) Parents cumulative liability for
reimbursement under the preceding clauses (a) and (b) and (y) any
direct expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with its
obligations pursuant to Section 6.14 (which for avoidance of doubt shall not
include the reimbursement or indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
6.14) shall not exceed $6,000,000 in the aggregate.  Any amounts that may be
owed by Parent for reimbursement pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of the
preceding sentence shall be payable in one lump-sum following final
calculation and documentation (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
of the total amount of such fees and expenses incurred;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent
shall have no further liability for reimbursement under clauses (a) and (b)
above after such time, if any, as Parent has paid the Parent Fee in
accordance with Section 8.5.

  



  

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former
director and officer of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out

  



        
   

  



  

of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party.

  



  

### (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i)
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

  

### 

  

### (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

### 

  

### (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts
or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_.  If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

  



  

6.13. _Parent Vote_.  Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause
to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and any
shares of common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the
power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide
a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of
stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this
Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all adjournments or
postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of stockholders of
either the Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

  



  

6.14. _Financing_. (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Letters and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing
Letters, if such amendment, modification or waiver (x) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount) or (y) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I)
delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. For
purposes of this Section 6.14, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 6.14(a) and references to "Financing Letters" or
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended or modified by this Section 6.14(a). Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts (I) to maintain in

  



        
   

  



  

effect the Financing Letters, to execute and deliver the Senior Secured Loan
Agreement and the Unsecured Term Loan Agreement (each as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and to negotiate all other definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee
letters, (II) to satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements and
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (III) to comply with
its obligations under the Financing Letters.  Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of
all definitive documents related to the Financing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the
Company prompt notice: (i) of any breach or default by any party to any
Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing of which
Parent and Merger Sub become aware; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any Financing source with respect to any:
(A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing
Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions
of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing
or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing; and
(iii) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or
the definitive documents related to the Financing; _provided_ , that Parent
and Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to disclose any information that
is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger
Sub shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a
way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within 5 days of the date the Company delivers Parent or
Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Financing to
fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement if all conditions to
closing contained in Article VII are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing to be
obtained through the issuance of Notes as contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing, then Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause, no later than the Closing, the
proceeds of the Unsecured Term Loans contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter to be used to replace such portion of the Notes not issued at Closing.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be
obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 6.14 or in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required (1) to amend or waive any of the terms or
conditions hereof or (2) to consummate the Closing any earlier than the final
day of the Marketing Period.

modified financing (collectively with the Financing, the "
_Available Financing_ ") ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and
their Financing sources as promptly as practicable with all financial
statements required to be delivered pursuant to clause A.2 (Financial

giving effect to any qualification therein with respect to receipt by Parent
or Merger Sub); (ii) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing
sources as promptly as practicable with information relating to the Company

in clause A.4(vi) of Annex E of the Debt Commitment Letter and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any material relating to the
Available Financing), (viii) providing authorization letters to the Financing
sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders
and containing a customary representation to the arranger of the Available

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which made they were made, not misleading and, in
the case of the public-side version, containing a representation to the
arranger of the Available Financing that such public-side version does not

Subsidiaries, (ix) cooperating reasonably with Parents Financing sources
due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable and to the extent not

survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) In the event that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) _either_ (x) (I) before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (the section relating to
the Termination Date) or Section 8.2(b) (the section relating to failure to
receive stockholder approval), (II) any Person shall have made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such
termination, and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly
withdrawn prior to such termination or, with respect to a termination
pursuant to Section 8.2(b), prior to the Stockholders Meeting, and (III)
within 12 months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (provided that for purposes of this
clause (III) the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%") _or_ (y) (I)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.4(c) (the
section relating to breach of the Acquisition Proposals covenant), and (II)
within 12 months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (provided that for purposes of this
clause (II) the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a)
(the section relating to a Change of Recommendation); or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.3(a) (the section relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement);

  

#### 

  

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than five business
days after the date of such termination (or, in the case of clause (i) above,
within five business days after the date on which the Company enters into the
agreement or consummates, approves or recommends the Acquisition Proposal
referred to in subclause (i)(z) above), (A) pay Parent or its designees all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Financing (provided that such expenses are documented by Parent
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company); provided that the
Company shall not be required to pay more than an aggregate of $5 million
pursuant to this Section 8.5(b)(A); and (B) pay Parent the Termination Fee
(as defined below) by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion).  " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to
$80 million if the Termination Fee becomes payable in connection with an
Alternate Acquisition Agreement entered into prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date and shall mean an amount equal to $115 million in all other
circumstances.

  



  

### (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Section 8.3(b) (the section relating to material breach by Parent or
Merger Sub); or

  



        
   

  



  

#### (ii) Section 8.3(c) (the section relating to failure to consummate on
the closing date specified by Section 1.2);

  

#### 

  

then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than five business days

wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Fee on more than one occasion) an amount
equal to (x) $275 million (the " _Parent Fee_ ") _minus_ (y) the sum of (A)
amounts paid by Parent for its reimbursement obligations described in the
clauses (a) and (b) of Section 6.10 and (B) any direct expenses incurred by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with its obligations pursuant to Section
6.14 (which for avoidance of doubt shall not include the reimbursement or
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 6.14); provided that the sum
of (A) and (B) shall not exceed $6 million.

  



  

### (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth
in Section 8.5(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the
amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall
pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the
Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Companys
receipt of the Parent Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5 and
the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Sections
6.14(b) and 6.14(d) hereof or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the
Guarantees shall, subject to Section 9.5(c), be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and its Subsidiaries against the former, current and future
equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of
the Guarantors, Parent or any former, current or future stockholder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
member, manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts,
none of the former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners or assignees of the Guarantors, Parent or any
former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent shall also be obligated
with respect to the first sentence of this Section 8.5(d) and the
indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent contained in Sections
6.14(b) and 6.14(d) and (ii) Parents receipt of the Termination Fee from the
Company pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall, subject to Section 9.5(c), be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and their
respective Affiliates against

  



        
   

  



  

### the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or
agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of
such amounts, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to
the first sentence of this Section 8.5(d)). For the avoidance of doubt,
subject to Section 9.5(c), (1) under no circumstances will the Company be
entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Fee, (2)
under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in excess
of the amount of the Termination Fee and (3) while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and the payment of the Parent Fee under
Section 8.5(c), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Fee.

indemnification and reimbursement provisions of Sections 6.14(b) and 6.14(d)
( _Financing_ ) and Section 8.5 ( _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_ ),

not survive the consummation of the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement.

applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties.

  



  

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the
parties obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of
such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws.

  



  

9.4. _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement.

  



  

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.
(a) THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND

  



        
   

  



  

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD
TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall
bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by
this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
or to the extent such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely
in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions
that are the subject of this Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to
laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective
if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.6 of this Agreement. Each
party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any
legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

### (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

  

### 

  

### (c) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger only in the event that (i) all
conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (or, with respect to
certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied
upon the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for
the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the financing provided
for by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if

  



        
   

  



  

### alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section
6.14, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article II will occur. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

  

### 

  

9.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

9.7. _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Guarantees
and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 2, 2009, between TPG
Capital, L.P. and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR

  



        
   

  



  

IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE
BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT
TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY

6.11 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and the
indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to Section
6.14(b) (Financing) only, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto.  Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

  



  

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_.  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due.

  



  

9.11. _Definitions_.  Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  



  

9.12. _Severability_.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable

  



         
 

  



  

and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out,
so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and
headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

### (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to
the section of this Agreement to which it relates.  The fact that any item
of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall
not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

9.14. _Assignment_.  This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of
the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first
written above.
