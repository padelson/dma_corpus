Charter Amendment Effective Time, the &#147;<U>Reverse Split Time</U>&#148;), by virtue of the Charter Amendment and without any action on the part of Saturn, Halley, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Saturn or Halley, the
Reverse Split shall be effected as provided in the Amended and Restated Halley Charter whereby each share of Halley Common Stock then issued and outstanding (including the shares of Halley Common Stock issued in connection with the exercise of
Halley Stock Options or Halley Warrants prior to the Reverse Split Time and Halley Vested Restricted Stock Award Shares) shall be combined into a fraction of a share of Halley Common Stock equal to the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio. In the event
that, as a result of the Reverse Split, a stockholder of Halley would hold a fractional share of Halley Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares that would be held by such stockholder after giving effect to the Reverse Split), such
stockholder&#146;s fractional share shall be sold, and the proceeds therefrom remitted to such stockholder, as follows: As promptly as practicable following the Charter Amendment Effective Time, Halley&#146;s existing transfer agent or another
transfer agent designated by Halley (the &#147;<U>Transfer Agent</U>&#148;) shall determine the aggregate number of shares of Halley Common Stock stockholders of Halley comprising the fractional shares of Halley Common Stock to be sold pursuant to
this sentence (such excess shares being herein referred to as the &#147;<U>Excess Shares</U>&#148;). As promptly as practicable following the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the Transfer Agent, as agent for such stockholders (the &#147;<U>Existing
Halley Holders</U>&#148;), shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided herein. The sale of the Excess Shares by the Transfer Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots
to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to Existing Halley Holders, the Transfer Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such Existing Halley Holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares shall be remitted to Existing Halley Holders, reduced by any and all commissions, transfer taxes and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> transaction costs, as
well as any expenses, of the Transfer Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Transfer Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each Existing Halley Holder shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount
of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such Existing Halley Holder is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Halley Common Stock held by such Existing
Halley Holder immediately prior to the effectuation of the Reverse Split and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Excess Shares. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be remitted to Existing Halley Holders with respect to any fractional share interests, the Transfer Agent shall promptly remit such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with the
foregoing. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Halley Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
other rights of a stockholder of Halley. The remittance of cash proceeds from the sale of such fractional shares of Halley Common Stock is not a separately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bargained-for</FONT> consideration and solely represents a
mechanical <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">rounding-off</FONT> of the fractions as a result of the Reverse Split. From and after the Reverse Split Time, certificates that represented shares of Halley Common Stock prior to the Reverse Split Time
shall, until presented for exchange, represent only the number of shares of Halley Common Stock into which such shares were combined pursuant to the Reverse Split. </P>

such case, no such Purported Transferee shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a Corporation Security, but such Purported Transferee and/or any Person whose ownership of Corporation Securities is attributed to such Purported

records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice required by this Section&nbsp;2.5 has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of

the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purposes of, any regular or special meeting of the Stockholders need be specified in any waiver of notice. </P>

and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall (A)&nbsp;ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each,

determination by the inspectors and (E)&nbsp;certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the person
presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies, votes or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware upon application by a Stockholder shall determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of Stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable

of Stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene, adjourn and reconvene the meeting from time to time, to prescribe such additional rules and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such person, are appropriate for the

properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and
to the extent determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of Stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. The Secretary or, in his or her absence, one of the
Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. If none of the officers above designated to act as the person presiding over the meeting or as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a person presiding over the meeting or a

the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)&nbsp;days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to

constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;1.4 of these bylaws until a quorum shall attend.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be
entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a

entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after
three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.
A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of
stockholders need not be by written ballot. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions presented to the
stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless a different or minimum vote is required by the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law
or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
