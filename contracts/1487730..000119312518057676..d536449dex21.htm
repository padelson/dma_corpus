viii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (as hereinafter amended, modified or changed
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof, this " _Agreement_ "),
dated as of February 24, 2018 is by and among HRG Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Halley_ "), HRG SPV Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Halley (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), HRG SPV Sub
II, LLC., a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Halley (" _Merger Sub 2_ ", and together with Merger Sub 1, "
_Merger Sub_ ") and Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Saturn_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto wish to effect a business combination by means of
(i) an amendment and restatement of the certificate of incorporation of
Halley (the " _Charter Amendment_ ") pursuant to which among other things, the
corporate name of Halley will, at or as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, change to "Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.", the share of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Halley (the " _Halley Preferred
Stock_ ") will automatically be cancelled without any action by the holder
thereof and each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Halley (the " _Halley Common Stock_ ") will, by means of a
reverse stock split (the " _Reverse Split_ "), be combined into a fraction of
a share of Halley Common Stock equal to the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio;
(ii) immediately following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split, Merger Sub
1 will be merged with and into Saturn (the " _First Merger_ " and, if the
Second Merger Opt-Out Condition has occurred, the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to
which Saturn will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halley and, except
as set forth herein, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Saturn (the " _Saturn Common Stock_ ") will be
converted into the right to receive one share of Halley Common Stock, all on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein; and
(iii) immediately following the effectiveness of the First Merger, if the
Second Merger Opt-Out Condition has not occurred, the surviving entity of the
First Merger will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the " _Second Merger_ "
and, if the Second Merger Opt-Out Condition has not occurred, collectively
with the First Merger, the " _Merger_ " ) pursuant to which Merger Sub 2 will
survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halley;

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, Halley and its
Subsidiaries beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 34,339,752 shares of
Saturn Common Stock;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended
to constitute, and is hereby adopted by Halley, Merger Sub and Saturn as, a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) for purposes of Sections 368, 354 and 361 of the
Code;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Halley, Merger Sub and
Saturn, and in the case of Saturn acting upon the unanimous recommendation of
a special committee of the Saturn board of directors consisting only of
independent and disinterested directors of Saturn (the " _Special Committee_
"), have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
determined that the Agreement, the Merger, the Charter Amendment, the Share
Issuance and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the respective stockholders or members of Halley,
Merger Sub and Saturn, as applicable, and resolved, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Charter Amendment and Share Issuance by the
respective stockholders or members of Halley, Merger Sub and Saturn, as
applicable; WHEREAS, Halley, Merger Sub and Saturn desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Charter
Amendment, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and also
to prescribe certain conditions precedent to the Charter Amendment and the
Merger as specified herein;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of Saturn to enter into this Agreement,
certain holders of shares of Halley Common Stock (each, a " _Halley Supporting
Stockholder_ ") are entering into voting and support agreements with Halley
(each a " _Halley Support Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other
things, each of the Halley Supporting Stockholders is agreeing, subject to the
terms of the applicable Halley Support Agreement, to vote all shares of Halley
Common Stock owned by such Halley Supporting Stockholder in favor of the
Charter Amendment (as the components thereof may be combined or separately
required to be proposed or presented) and the Share Issuance;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of Saturn to enter into this Agreement,
Halley is entering into a voting and support agreement with Saturn (the "
_Saturn Support Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, Halley is
agreeing, subject to the terms of the Saturn Support Agreement, to vote all
shares of Saturn Common Stock owned by Halley in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of the parties to enter into this Agreement,
Halley and Leucadia National Corporation (" _L_ ") are executing a
stockholders agreement (the " _Post-Closing Stockholders Agreement_ "), to be
effective as of the Closing, setting forth certain rights and obligations of
Halley and L after the Closing; and

 

WHEREAS, at or prior to the Closing, and as a condition to the willingness of
the parties to enter into this Agreement, Halley, L and CF Turul LLC (" _F_
") will execute a registration rights agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Post-Closing Registration Rights
Agreement_ "), setting forth certain rights and obligations of Halley, L and
F after the Closing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Halley, Merger Sub and Saturn hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

CLOSING TRANSACTIONS

Section 1.1 _Charter Amendment_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(" _DGCL_ "), at the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of Halley shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety
as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Amended and Restated Halley Charter_ ").
The certificate of incorporation of Halley, as so amended and restated, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of Halley from and after the Charter
Amendment Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and the DGCL, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 



2 (b) Immediately after the Charter Amendment Effective Time (such time
immediately after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the " _Reverse Split
Time_ "), by virtue of the Charter Amendment and without any action on the
part of Saturn, Halley, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of Saturn or Halley, the Reverse Split shall be effected as provided in
the Amended and Restated Halley Charter whereby each share of Halley Common
Stock then issued and outstanding (including the shares of Halley Common Stock
issued in connection with the exercise of Halley Stock Options or Halley
Warrants prior to the Reverse Split Time and Halley Vested Restricted Stock
Award Shares) shall be combined into a fraction of a share of Halley Common
Stock equal to the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio. In the event that, as a
result of the Reverse Split, a stockholder of Halley would hold a fractional
share of Halley Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares that
would be held by such stockholder after giving effect to the Reverse Split),
such stockholders fractional share shall be sold, and the proceeds therefrom
remitted to such stockholder, as follows: As promptly as practicable following
the Charter Amendment Effective Time, Halleys existing transfer agent or
another transfer agent designated by Halley (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") shall
determine the aggregate number of shares of Halley Common Stock stockholders
of Halley comprising the fractional shares of Halley Common Stock to be sold
pursuant to this sentence (such excess shares being herein referred to as the
" _Excess Shares_ "). As promptly as practicable following the Charter
Amendment Effective Time, the Transfer Agent, as agent for such stockholders
(the " _Existing Halley Holders_ "), shall sell the Excess Shares at then-
prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided herein. The sale of
the Excess Shares by the Transfer Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net
proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to Existing Halley
Holders, the Transfer Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
Existing Halley Holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or sales of Excess
Shares shall be remitted to Existing Halley Holders, reduced by any and all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
as well as any expenses, of the Transfer Agent incurred in connection with
such sale or sales. The Transfer Agent shall determine the portion of such net
proceeds to which each Existing Halley Holder shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such Existing Halley Holder is entitled (after taking into account all shares
of Halley Common Stock held by such Existing Halley Holder immediately prior
to the effectuation of the Reverse Split and rounded to the nearest thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
number of Excess Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be remitted to Existing Halley Holders with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Transfer Agent shall promptly
remit such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with
the foregoing. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Halley
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share
interest, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Halley. The
remittance of cash proceeds from the sale of such fractional shares of Halley
Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration and solely
represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions as a result of the
Reverse Split. From and after the Reverse Split Time, certificates that
represented shares of Halley Common Stock prior to the Reverse Split
Time shall, until presented for exchange, represent only the number of shares
of Halley Common Stock into which such shares were combined pursuant to the
Reverse Split.

 

Section 1.2 _The Merger_. Following the Reverse Split Time, upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 shall be
merged with and into Saturn, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub 1
will cease, with Saturn continuing as the surviving corporation (Saturn, as
the surviving corporation in the First Merger, sometimes being referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), such that immediately following
the First Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Halley. The First Merger shall have the effects provided in this
Agreement and as specified in the DGCL. Following the

 



3  Effective Time, but only if the Second Merger Opt-Out Condition has not
occurred, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the Limited Liability Company
Act of the State of Delaware (the " _LLC Act_ " ), pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 1.6_, at the Second Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be merged with and into Merger Sub 2, whereupon the separate existence of the
Surviving Corporation will cease, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the
surviving company (Merger Sub 2, as the surviving company in the Second
Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving Company_ "),
such that immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Company will be
a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Halley. The Second Merger shall have the
effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the LLC
Act.

 

Section 1.3 _Post-Closing Governance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Halley shall take all action necessary (including
obtaining all necessary director resignations) so that, as of the Effective
Time, the board of directors of Halley will consist solely of (i) Kenneth C.
Ambrecht, Norman S. Matthews, David M. Maura, Terry L. Polistina, Hugh R.
Rovit, Andreas Rouve and Joseph S. Steinberg (or if such person is unable
or unwilling to serve as a member of the board of directors of Halley at the
Effective Time as a result of illness, death, resignation, removal or any
other reason, then the person who succeeded such person as a director of
Saturn prior to the First Merger), each to be a member of the class of the
board of directors of Halley set forth opposite such Persons name in the
Amended and Restated Halley Charter; and (ii) an individual designated by L
(the " _Independent Designee_ ") who satisfies the Independent Designee
Requirements and which such individual shall be a member of Class III (as such
term is used in the Amended and Restated Halley Charter). Each of the
individuals who is or becomes a director of Halley as of the Effective Time
in accordance with the foregoing shall continue as a director of Halley from
and after the Effective Time until the earlier of his or her death,
resignation or removal or the time at which his or her successor is duly
elected and qualified (and in the case of Mr. Steinberg and the Independent
Designee, in accordance with the Post-Closing Stockholders Agreement).

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Halley shall take all action necessary so that, as
of the Effective Time, the officers of Saturn immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of Halley immediately following the
Effective Time (or if any such individual is unwilling or unable to so serve
as an officer of Halley, a replacement designated by Saturn).

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of Halley shall take all
action necessary so that, as of the Effective Time, the bylaws of Halley
shall have been amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ hereto. The bylaws of Halley, as so amended and restated, shall be
the bylaws of Halley from and after the Effective Time until thereafter

Halley and the DGCL, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 

(d) The parties agree that, from and after the Effective Time, the NYSE ticker
symbol for the shares of Halley Common Stock will be Saturns ticker symbol
as of the date hereof.

Section 1.4 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the closing of the First Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10022, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd)
Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver by the applicable party of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the applicable party of those
conditions at such time), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed to in writing by Halley and Saturn. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



4 Section 1.5 _Charter Amendment Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Halley shall
cause the Amended and Restated Halley Charter to be duly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Sections 242 and 245 and the other applicable provisions of the DGCL. The
Charter Amendment shall become effective prior to, and subject to the

make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by

Halley and specified in the Certificate of First Merger in accordance with the
DGCL (the date and time at which the First Merger becomes effective being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, but only if the Second Merger
Opt-Out Condition has not occurred, the parties will cause a certificate of

(c) At the Second Merger Effective Time (i) each share of the Surviving
Corporation common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger

respect thereto, and (ii) the limited liability company interests of Merger

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES IN THE FIRST MERGER

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First Merger and without any action on the part of Saturn, Halley, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Saturn or Halley:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub 1
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereupon be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) Each share of Saturn Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and subject to the
limitation in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_) shall thereupon be converted into the
right to receive one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
Halley Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The parties hereto
agree that the one-for-one exchange ratio and the Merger Consideration were
determined assuming that the Reverse Split shall have occurred prior to the
First Merger.

 



6 (c) Each share of Saturn Common Stock held in the treasury of Saturn or owned
or held, directly or indirectly, by Halley or any Subsidiary of Halley or
Saturn immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such share, a "
_Cancelled Share_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(d) All shares of Saturn Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter only represent the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, in each
case to be issued or paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, without
interest, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Halley
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger to any Saturn stockholder if as a
result of such issuance such Saturn stockholder would become a Substantial
Holder (as such term is defined in Article XIII of the Amended and Restated
Halley Charter in effect at the Effective Time); _provided_ that, any share of
Halley Common Stock that would be issuable to any such Saturn stockholder but
for the operation of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and the applicable
provisions of Article XIII of the Amended and Restated Halley Charter in
effect at the Effective Time shall instead be treated as Excess Securities
(as such term is defined in Article XIII of the Amended and Restated Halley
Charter in effect at the Effective Time) and be issued to the Agent (as such
term is defined in Article XIII of the Amended and Restated Halley Charter in
effect at the Effective Time) and thereafter be disposed of by the Agent in
accordance with Section 13(b)(ii) of Article XIII of the Amended and Restated
Halley Charter in effect at the Effective Time. 

Section 2.2 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Halley and Saturn shall jointly appoint a bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, and
prior to filing the Certificate of First Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, Halley shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) book-
entry shares of Halley Common Stock representing the aggregate Merger
Consideration with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
record of shares of Saturn Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_. In
addition, Halley shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent,
as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_. In the event such
deposit shall be insufficient to make payments, Halley shall promptly deposit,
or cause to be deposited, additional book-entry shares of Halley Common Stock
or funds, as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. All book-entry
shares of Halley Common Stock, dividends and distributions deposited with the
Exchange Agent are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, except
as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Halley shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (" _Certificates_ "), and
may cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a book-entry share ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Saturn Common Stock (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and which
letter shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Halley,
Saturn and the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the

 



7  Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ (which
instructions shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as
Halley, Saturn and the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify). With respect to
holders of Saturn Book-Entry Shares, the parties shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to transmit,
following the Effective Time, to such holders or their nominees, upon
surrender of Saturn Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Each holder of shares of Saturn Common Stock that have been converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)_, upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of Halley Common Stock
to which such holder of Saturn Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ (as modified by
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, if applicable) (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form), and (ii) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds,
after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.5_) of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any Merger Consideration, or any unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Halley shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the
preceding sentence as soon as practicable following the valid surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ (as modified by
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, if applicable) in respect thereof and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, but
shall not entitle its holder or any other Person to any rights as a
stockholder of Saturn or Halley.

(d) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Halley and the Exchange
Agent that such Tax is not applicable.

 

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Halley Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares
of Halley Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon
the surrender thereof, until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_.
Following the proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this _Article II_ , there shall be paid to the record holder
thereof, without interest, in addition to the Merger Consideration, (i)
promptly following such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender in respect of the whole shares of
Halley Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration in exchange for such
surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender in respect of the shares of Halley
Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration in exchange for such surrender.
For purposes of dividends and other distributions in respect of the Halley
Common Stock, the Halley Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to dividends and other distributions pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



8 (f) The Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ issued and paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Saturn Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Saturn shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Saturn Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for transfer, or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares,
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income
earned on the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any remaining holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Law), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger
Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_. None of Halley, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of
shares of Halley Common Stock, dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity,
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Halley;  _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the
United States with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed
by the United States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Halley
and the Exchange Agent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Halley or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Halley or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Saturn Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Saturn Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each award of Saturn Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other
lapse restriction granted under a Saturn Plan (each, a " _Saturn Restricted
Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Halley and shall be automatically converted into a
restricted stock award of Halley Common

 



9  Stock equal to the number of shares of Saturn Common Stock subject to such
Saturn Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _New Halley Restricted Stock Award_ "). Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, each Saturn Restricted Stock Award
assumed and converted into a New Halley Restricted Stock Award pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Saturn
Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Saturn RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each vested
and unvested restricted stock unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Saturn Common Stock granted under a Saturn Plan (each, a " _Saturn
RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Halley and shall be automatically converted into a
restricted share unit award of Halley Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Saturn Common Stock subject to such Saturn RSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _New Halley RSU Award_ ").
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_, each Saturn RSU
Award assumed and converted into a New Halley RSU Award pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Saturn RSU Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Saturn PSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each vested
and unvested performance share unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Saturn Common Stock granted under a Saturn Plan (each, a " _Saturn
PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Halley and shall be automatically converted into a
performance share unit award of Halley Common Stock equal the number of shares
of Saturn Common Stock subject to such Saturn PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _New Halley PSU Award_ "). Each Saturn
PSU Award that is assumed and converted into a New Halley PSU Award pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Saturn PSU
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Saturn Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, Saturn, the board of
directors of Saturn and any applicable committee thereof shall pass
resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to
Saturn Plans or Saturn Equity Awards and take such other actions as are
necessary to provide for the treatment of Saturn Restricted Stock Awards,
Saturn RSU Awards and Saturn PSU Awards (collectively, the " _Saturn Equity
Awards_ ") contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

 

(e) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Halley_. At the Effective Time, Halley shall
assume all rights and obligations in respect of each equity-based Saturn
Plan, including each outstanding Saturn Equity Award, and will be able to
grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Law under the
terms of Saturn Plans, except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be
shares of Halley Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Saturn Plan to a
number of shares of Saturn Common Stock shall be amended or deemed amended to
refer instead to a number of shares of Halley Common Stock equal to the number
of referenced shares of Saturn Common Stock; and (iii) the board of directors
of Halley or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the board of directors of Saturn or any committee thereof
with respect to the administration of such Saturn Plan.

(f) _Halley Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, Halley, the board of
directors of Halley and any applicable committee thereof shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but
unissued shares of Halley Common Stock sufficient to cover the settlement of
the New Halley Restricted Stock Awards, New Halley RSU Awards and New Halley
PSU Awards that are converted in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.
Saturn and Halley shall cooperate in

 



10  connection with the preparation of registration statements on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate form, including a Form S-1 or Form S-3 in
the case of awards held by former employees and service providers of Saturn)
with respect to the shares of Halley Common Stock subject to such awards,
in order to file such forms effective as of the Effective Time or, in the
event the necessary financial information required for such filings is not
filed or able to be filed with the SEC as of the Effective Time, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Halley Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Halley Stock Options_ _and Warrants_. As of the date that is ten days
prior to the Effective Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
each stock option granted under a Halley Plan or otherwise (a " _Halley Stock
Option_ ") and each warrant granted under a Halley Plan or otherwise (a "
_Halley Warrant_ ") that in either case is then outstanding and unvested
shall become fully vested and exercisable. To the extent that, prior to the
Reverse Split Time, the holder of a Halley Stock Option or Halley Warrant
exercises such Halley Stock Option or Halley Warrant, the shares of
Halley Common Stock issued to such holder on such exercise shall be treated
as a share of Halley Common Stock for all purposes under this Agreement,
including the Reverse Split and the First Merger. As of the Reverse Split
Time, each Halley Stock Option and each Halley Warrant that is then
outstanding and unexercised shall be adjusted by (i) multiplying the number of
shares of Halley Common Stock covered by such Halley Stock Option or Halley
Warrant by the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio and rounding down to the
nearest whole share and (ii) dividing the per-share exercise price of such
Halley Stock Option or Halley Warrant by the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio
and rounding up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ that each such Halley
Stock Option or Halley Warrant shall be further adjusted to the extent
required to remain compliant with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations issued thereunder. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_
__ _ 2.4(a)_, each such adjusted Halley Stock Option or Halley Warrant shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to such Halley Stock Option or Halley Warrant as of immediately prior
to the Reverse Split Time.

(b) _Halley Restricted Stock Awards_. Immediately prior to the Reverse Split
Time and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each award of
Halley Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction
granted under a Halley Plan (each, a " _Halley Restricted Stock Award_ ")
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split Time shall
vest in full and become fully vested shares of Halley Common Stock (the "
_Halley Vested Restricted Stock Award Shares_ ") (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, net of any applicable shares of Halley Common Stock used to satisfy any
withholding taxes). As of the Reverse Split Time, each Halley Vested
Restricted Stock Award Share shall be treated as a share of Halley Common
Stock for all purposes under this Agreement, including the Reverse Split and
the First Merger.

(c) _Halley Actions_. Prior to the Reverse Split Time, Halley, the board of
directors of Halley and any applicable committee thereof shall pass
resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to
the Halley Plans or Halley Equity Awards and take such other actions as
are necessary and approved by Saturn (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) to provide for the equitable adjustment of
the Halley Stock Options and Halley Restricted Stock Awards (collectively, "
_Halley Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

Section 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Halley, Saturn, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, applicable Treasury
Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



11 Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Halley Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend or any subdivision split (including a reverse stock split),
combination or consolidation of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred (in each case, other than the Reverse Split), then any number or
amount contained herein (including any exchange ratio) which is based upon the
number of shares of Halley Common Stock will be equitably adjusted to provide
to Halley, the holders of Halley Common Stock, the holders of Halley Equity
Awards, the holders of Saturn Common Stock and the holders of Saturn Equity
Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_
shall be construed to permit Halley to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

Section 2.7 _Delivery of Halley Closing Certificate_.

 

(a) Ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Halley shall deliver to
Saturn a certificate executed by a senior executive officer of Halley setting
forth (based on the information then known at such time) an accurate and
complete itemized list (other than in each case for de minimis inaccuracies)
of any and all Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, and Halley Final Unpaid
Transaction Expenses, together with a calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness
resulting therefrom (the " _Halley Closing Certificate_ "), in each case, (a)
as of 11:59 pm New York time on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Adjustment Measurement Date_ ") and (b) in a manner consistent with
the definitions and other applicable provisions of this Agreement. The Halley
Closing Certificate shall include reasonable supporting detail for each of
the items and calculations set forth therein, including, in the case of
Halley Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses, final invoices for each of Halleys
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, or other advisors whose fees would
constitute Halley Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses. The Halley Closing
Certificate shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_.

 

(b) Following delivery of the Halley Closing Certificate, Halley shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, promptly (and in
any event within twenty four hours upon delivery of the Halley Closing
Certificate) provide reasonable access to the financial records, supporting
documents and work papers and personnel of Halley and its Subsidiaries to
Saturn and its accountants and other representatives (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) as may be
reasonable necessary for its and their review of the Halley Closing
Certificate. In the event that, within three Business Days following the
provision of such required access, Saturn provides Halley with written notice
of any objections to the Halley Closing Certificate and/or the calculations of
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Halley Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses
and Closing Net Indebtedness, Halley and Saturn shall promptly negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such objections prior to the Closing, and the Halley
Closing Certificate and the calculations set forth thereon shall be modified
with any resulting changes as may be mutually agreed by Halley and Saturn. If
Halley and Saturn are unable to reach agreement within two Business Days
following delivery of such objections, they shall promptly thereafter jointly
retain the dispute resolution group of PricewaterhouseCoopers (or, if such
Person is unwilling or unable to serve, such other independent accounting firm
of recognized national standing as Halley and Saturn may mutually agree, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the " _Accounting Referee_ ")
to review any items that remain in dispute (together with any calculations
that Halley proposes to change pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_ and which
Saturn disputes, the " _Disputed Items_ "), and only those items, for the
purpose of calculating Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Halley Final Unpaid
Transaction Expenses and Closing Net Indebtedness, as applicable (it being
understood and agreed that in conducting such review and making such
calculation, the Accounting

 



12  Referee shall adhere to the provisions of this Agreement, and shall not
conduct an independent review). Halley and Saturn shall promptly provide their
assertions regarding the Disputed Items in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ")
to the Accounting Referee and to each other. The Accounting Referee shall be
instructed to render its determination in the form of a written report setting
forth its calculations (including the basis thereof) with respect to the
Disputed Items as promptly as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto
agree should not be later than three Business Days following the date on which
the disagreement is referred to the Accounting Referee), and the Accounting
Referees determination of each Disputed Item shall not be greater than the
greater value for such Disputed Item claimed by either party in the Dispute
Notice. The Accounting Referees report shall be final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder, shall be deemed a final
arbitration award that is binding on the parties hereto, and neither Halley
nor Saturn shall seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other
than to enforce such report in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee to resolve the Disputed
Items shall be borne (i) by Halley if Halley is awarded less than 50% of the
aggregate value of all Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee,
(ii) by Saturn if Saturn is awarded less than 50% of the aggregate value of
all Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee and (iii) otherwise
equally by Halley and Saturn. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting
Referee that are borne by Halley, if any, shall be deemed to constitute Halley
Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses hereunder.

(c) From and after delivery of the Halley Closing Certificate, Halley shall
use reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day) inform Saturn if it obtains knowledge that any of the calculations of
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Halley Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses
and Closing Net Indebtedness have changed (other than de minimis changes) and
such Halley Closing Certificate shall be deemed amended accordingly. Upon
notice of such a change, the Halley Closing Certificate, inclusive of such
changes, shall be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 2.7(b).

 

(d) The Halley Closing Certificate as modified pursuant to Section 2.7(b)-(c)
shall be final and binding on the parties.

 

Section 2.8 _Delivery of Halley Capitalization Certificate_. Concurrently with
the delivery of a Halley Closing Certificate, Halley shall also deliver to
Saturn a certificate, executed by a senior executive officer of Halley setting
forth an accurate and complete statement (other than minimis inaccuracies) of
(1) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Halley Common Stock, (2)
the Unadjusted Saturn Shares Held by Halley, and (3) the number of shares of
Halley Common Stock issuable in respect of all outstanding Halley Stock
Options and the number of shares of Halley Common Stock underlying
outstanding Halley Restricted Stock Awards, in each case as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Halley Capitalization Certificate").

exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of Saturn or rights or interests described in the preceding
clauses (A) through (C), or (E) obligations of Saturn or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or
to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or
sold, any such securities.

and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Saturn Support
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Saturn Support Agreement by Saturn and the consummation by
Saturn of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Saturn and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Saturn are
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Saturn Support Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, other than, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, Saturn
Stockholder Approval. Each of this Agreement and the Saturn Support Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Saturn and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Saturn, enforceable against
Saturn in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity).

(b) The board of directors of Saturn, acting upon the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held, adopted
resolutions, which as of the date of this Agreement have not been amended or
withdrawn, (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Saturn
Support Agreement, the Halley Support Agreements and the Post-
Closing Stockholders Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of
Saturns stockholders other than Halley and its Subsidiaries, (ii) approving
and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Saturn Support Agreement, the
Halley Support Agreements, the Post-Closing Stockholders Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) directing
that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Saturn for their

in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
change in or modification or rescission of the board of directors of Saturns
recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall not be a breach
of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(c) The Saturn Requisite Stockholder Approvals are the only votes of the
holders of any class or series of Saturns capital stock or other securities
required in connection with the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, under applicable Law,

conflict with or violate the Saturn Charter or Saturn Bylaws, (ii)
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien in or upon any of the material properties, assets or
rights of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries under any bond, debenture, note,
mortgage, indenture, guarantee, license, lease, purchase or sale order,
commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, undertaking, permit or
franchise (each, including all amendments thereto, a " _Contract_ ") to which
Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Saturn or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
(iii) subject to the governmental and regulatory filings and other matters
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, conflict with or violate any federal,
state, local, municipal, foreign or other law, statute, constitution,
principle of common law, resolution, ordinance, code, edict, decree, rule,
regulation, order, award, ruling or requirement issued, enacted,
adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or under
the authority of any Governmental Entity (" _Law_ ") applicable to Saturn or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except in the cases of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, that would
not reasonably be expected to have a Saturn Material Adverse Effect.

failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Saturn Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Saturn specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto or at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by or on behalf of Saturn specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint

 



16  Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time it is first mailed to Saturns
stockholders or Halleys stockholders or at the time of the Halley
Stockholders Meeting or the Saturn Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the

respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (i) at
the times the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time the Form S-4
becomes effective, (ii) at the times the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
mailed to Saturns stockholders and Halleys stockholders and (iii) at the
time of the Saturn Stockholders Meeting and the Halley Stockholders Meeting.
The representations and warranties contained in this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ do
not and will not apply to statements included or incorporated by reference in
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Halley specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements._ __

 

(a) Saturn has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis all forms,
reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed with
or furnished to the SEC by Saturn since January 1, 2016 (all such documents,
together with all exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all
information incorporated therein by reference, and any amendments
or supplements thereto, the " _Saturn SEC Documents_ "). True, correct and
complete copies of all Saturn SEC Documents are publicly available in the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval database of the SEC. As of
their respective filing or furnished dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing or a document furnished prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
such filing or furnished date), the Saturn SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Saturn SEC Documents at
the time it was filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Saturns
Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports, schedules,
statements or other documents with the SEC.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes and
any schedules thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Saturn
SEC Documents (i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto, or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act), (ii) comply as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iii)
fairly present in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the
consolidated financial position of Saturn and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes
in stockholders equity for the periods reflected therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, to
the absence of notes and to any other adjustments described therein,
including any notes thereto, in each case, that were not, or are not expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, material in amount). Since January 1,
2016, Saturn has not made any change in the accounting practices or policies
applied in the preparation of its financial statements, except as required by
GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.

 

(c) Saturn has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to Saturn, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in Saturns periodic and
current reports

 



17  under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and made known to Saturns management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or others
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. Saturns
management has evaluated, with the participation of Saturns principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, the effectiveness of Saturns disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Saturn SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, their conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation.

 

(d) Saturn and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) regarding the reliability of Saturns
financial reporting and the preparation of Saturns financial statements for

or representative of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,

the date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course since the
date of such balance sheet, (c) for liabilities or obligations arising out of

reasonably be expected to have a Saturn Material Adverse Effect. None of
Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 2016, a
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or Person
alleging or relating to a possible failure of Saturn or any of its
Subsidiaries to so be in compliance that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Saturn Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 3.10 _Taxes_. Neither Saturn nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or

of any "moratorium," "fair price," "business combination," "control share
acquisition" or similar provision of any state anti-takeover Law or any anti-
takeover provision in its governing documents (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_
"), inapplicable to this Agreement, the Saturn Support Agreement, the Halley

opinion, and subject to and based upon the various limitations, matters,
qualifications and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the

Stock (other than Cancelled Shares) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. A copy of such opinion will be
delivered promptly after the date hereof to Halley for informational purposes
only and it is agreed and understood that such opinions may not be relied on
by Halley, or any director, officer or employee of Halley.

 



19 Section 3.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Saturn has made its
own inquiry and investigation into Halley and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates and has made an independent judgment concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Saturn represents, warrants, acknowledges and

or supplements thereto, the " _Halley SEC Documents_ "). True, correct and
complete copies of all Halley SEC Documents are publicly available in the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval database of the SEC. As of

such filing or furnished date), the Halley SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Halley SEC Documents at
the time it was filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Halleys
Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports, schedules,
statements or other documents with the SEC.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes and

all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iii)
fairly present in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the

SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.

 



25 (c) Halley has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"

consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in Halleys periodic and
current reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and made known to Halleys
management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or others performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange
Act. Halleys management has evaluated, with the participation of Halleys
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing

any amendment thereto, their conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such

"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) regarding the reliability of Halleys
financial reporting and the preparation of Halleys financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP which is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that records are maintained in reasonable detail to
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Halley and its Subsidiaries, (ii) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (iii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iv) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
properties or assets of Halley and its Subsidiaries. Halley has disclosed,

financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Halleys auditors and audit
committee, which disclosure is set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.6(d)_ of the
Halley Disclosure Letter (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of Halleys internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Halleys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Halleys internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2016, any material change in internal
control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Halley SEC
Document has been so disclosed.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2016, neither Halley nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to
the knowledge of Halley, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of Halley or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Halley or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim relating to an
individual with responsibility for these matters or that Halley or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in improper accounting or auditing practices.

received from the SEC staff with respect to the Halley SEC Documents. None of
the Halley SEC Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC
comment or investigation.

consolidated balance sheet (as amended or restated prior to the date hereof,
if applicable) of Halley included in the Halley SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of
business since the date of such balance sheet, (c) for liabilities or
obligations arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (d) for liabilities and obligations that, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect.

supplied by or on behalf of Halley or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion

imposed by the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_. Each of Saturn and
Halley shall promptly (but in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise
the other of any Acquisition Proposal received by such party, the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that, if any
Representative of Saturn or Halley or any of their respective Subsidiaries
takes any action that would constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_
if it were authorized or permitted by Saturn or Halley, respectively, such
action shall constitute a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by Saturn or
Halley, respectively, whether or not such action shall have been authorized or
permitted by Saturn or Halley, respectively, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, unless such Representative has agreed (in any capacity) in a
writing enforceable by such party not to take any such action. Notwithstanding
the restrictions set forth above in this Section 5.3(a), in the event that
Saturn or Halley receives, after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Saturn Requisite Stockholder Approvals or Halley Stockholder
Approval, respectively, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from any breach of this Section 5.3 and that the board of directors
of such party determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be, or
to be reasonably expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, such party may (1)
engage in negotiations with, furnish any information with respect to such
party and its Subsidiaries to, and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of such party and its Subsidiaries to, the Person or
group (and their respective Representatives) making such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , that prior to

 



34  furnishing any such information, it (x) receives from such Person or group
an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms and restrictions that
are customary for confidentiality agreements executed in similar
circumstances and (y) provides prior written notice to the other party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that all such information is provided or made
available to the other party (to the extent not previously provided or made
available) substantially concurrently with it being provided or made available
to such Third Party and (2) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the board of directors of Saturn or
Halley nor any committee thereof (including, in the case of Saturn, the
Saturn Special Committee) shall (i) either (A) withdraw (or modify, withhold
or qualify in any manner adverse to the other party), or propose publicly to
withdraw (or modify, withhold or qualify in any manner adverse to the
other party), the Saturn Recommendation or the Halley Recommendation,
respectively, (B) adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition
Proposal, (C) make any public recommendation in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a
"stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or fail to recommend against acceptance
of such tender or exchange offer by the close of business on the 10th business
day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act (it being understood and agreed that the
board of directors of such party or committee thereof (including, in the case
of Saturn, the Saturn Special Committee) may take no position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer during the
period referred to in this clause) or (D) other than with respect to a tender
offer or exchange offer, fail to publicly reaffirm its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement within five Business Days after another party
hereto so requests in writing if an Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto shall have been made publicly or sent or given to the
stockholders of the other party (or any Person or group shall have publicly
announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow Saturn or Halley, respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, or other
similar agreement or arrangement constituting or providing for an Acquisition
Proposal or requiring such party to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Saturn Requisite Stockholder Approvals or Halley
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the board of directors of Saturn or
Halley, respectively, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change solely in
response to either (i) any material event, development, circumstance,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts that (A) was not known to or
reasonably foreseeable (or the material consequences of which (or the
magnitude of which) was not known or reasonably foreseeable) to such partys
board of directors on the date of this Agreement and did not result from a
breach of this Agreement by such party, and (B) does not relate to
an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (ii) an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, if
(A) in the case of clause (ii), the board of directors of such party
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), the board of directors of such party determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law.

 



35 (d) A party shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i) such
party shall have first provided to the other party four Business Days prior
written notice (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice shall state expressly
(A) that it has received a Superior Proposal or that there has been an
Intervening Event, (B) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the per share value of the
consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making the Superior Proposal), and include a copy of the relevant
material proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group of Persons
making such Superior Proposal and other material documents (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment (or subsequent amendment) to the
financial terms, including to the proposed purchase price, or to any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall each require the notifying party
to provide a new notice to the other party in accordance with this clause 
_(d)_ ; _provided_ that the Notice Period in connection with any such new
notice shall be three Business Days), (C) in the case of an Intervening Event,
a description of the material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or
change, and (D) that it intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and,
in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and (ii) prior to making an
Adverse Recommendation Change, during the Notice Period, to the extent
requested by the other party, engaged in good faith negotiations with such
other party, to amend this Agreement, and considered in good faith any bona
fide offer by such other party and, after such negotiations and good faith
consideration of such offer, if any, the board of directors of the notifying
party again makes the determination described in the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ (it being understood that the delivery of the
notification contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ shall not, in and
of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit Saturn or
Halley or their respective boards of directors or any committee thereof
(including, in the case of Saturn, the Saturn Special Committee) from (i)
issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its
stockholders positions contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer),
(ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar communication to its
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
(iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of its board of directors, after consultation with outside counsel, failure
to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law or is otherwise
required by applicable Law; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not permit
the board of directors of Saturn or Halley or any committee thereof, as
applicable, to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, except as permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, with
respect to a party hereto, any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing)
by a Third Party, with respect to any (A) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale
of capital stock of or other equity interests in either Saturn or Halley or
their respective Subsidiaries) of any business or assets of such party or any
of its Subsidiaries representing ten percent (10%) or more of the consolidated
revenues or assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person or
group (including by way of merger, consolidation, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity
interests in Saturn or Halley or their respective Subsidiaries) of securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing ten percent (10%) or more of
the voting power or economic interests in such party, or (C) transaction
(including a merger, consolidation, other business combination, partnership,
joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a
Subsidiary of Saturn or Halley or otherwise) in which any Person or group
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) 

 



36  of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing ten
percent (10%) or more of the voting power or economic interests in such
party; _provided_ that an Acquisition Proposal does not include any proposal
or offer by another party to this Agreement or any of its Subsidiaries. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)_ shall not apply to proposals, offers or agreements with respect
to, or any discussions related to, any of the transactions or matters
described in clauses (A)-(C) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal that
relate (x) specifically to the battery or appliances business of Saturn and
its Subsidiaries or (y) other transactions that, in either case, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or make more unlikely
to occur the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, so long as in each case Saturn keeps Halley informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of such negotiations and the proposed
terms and conditions thereof. 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means, with
respect to a party hereto, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that such
partys board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with

aspects of the proposal and the identity of the Person making the proposal (a)
is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed, (b) is more
favorable from a financial point of view to such party and its stockholders
than the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and (c) is otherwise on terms that the board of directors of such party has
determined to be superior to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement, except that each
reference to ten percent (10%) set forth therein shall be replaced with a
reference to a majority.

Section 5.4 _SEC Filings; Stockholders Meeting_ _s_.

(a) _Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Saturn and
Halley shall jointly prepare and Halley shall cause to be filed with the SEC
the Form S-4, which will include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
sent to the stockholders of Saturn relating to the Saturn Stockholders Meeting
and to the stockholders of Halley relating to the Halley Stockholders Meeting
and will also constitute a prospectus with respect to the shares of Halley
Common Stock issuable to the stockholders of Saturn in the First Merger. Each
of Halley and Saturn will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to
keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the First
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Saturn and
Halley shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the holders of the Saturn Common Stock
and to the holders of the Halley Common Stock as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 shall have become effective and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall have been cleared by the SEC. Each of Saturn and
Halley shall furnish all non-privileged information concerning such party as
may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement. No filing of the Form S-4 will be made by Halley, and no filing of
the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Saturn or Halley, in each case,
without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon.

 



37 (ii) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be
discovered by Saturn or Halley that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that
any of such documents would not contain any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law,
disseminated to stockholders of Saturn and/or Halley, as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of such notice and the filing of
any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(iii) Saturn and Halley shall promptly notify each other upon the receipt of
any comments, whether oral or written, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
on, or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, and
shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence (and a summary of
all substantive oral communications) with the SEC or the staff of the SEC with
respect to the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Saturn
and Halley shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the
SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.
Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any substantive correspondence
(including responses to SEC comments) or amendments or supplements to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 prior to filing with the SEC,
and shall provide to the other a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.

(iv) Except for the purpose of disclosing any Adverse Recommendation Change,
no amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4, nor any response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC with
respect to such filings, will be made by Saturn or Halley without
the approval of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned (it being understood that it shall be
unreasonable to withhold consent with respect to any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 to the extent such
amendment or supplement is required to be included therein so that the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading as may be
required by Rule 10b-5 or Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act or Section 11
or Section 12 of the Securities Act).

(v) Halley shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) reasonably
required to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws
in connection with the issuance of shares of Halley Common Stock in the First
Merger, and Saturn shall furnish all information concerning Saturn as Halley
may reasonably request in connection with any such action.

 

(vi) Each of Halley and Saturn, as applicable, will advise the other promptly
after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of the
Halley Common Stock issuable in connection with the First Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction.

(b) _Saturn Stockholders Meeting_. Saturn shall use, irrespective of whether
the board of directors of Saturn has made an Adverse Recommendation Change,
its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is cleared by the SEC, in accordance with applicable Law,
the Saturn Charter

 



38  and the Saturn Bylaws duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Saturn
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement. Except during such time as an Adverse
Recommendation Change is in effect in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Saturn, through the board of
directors of Saturn, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt
this Agreement (the " _Saturn Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Saturn Stockholders Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Saturn

necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to Saturns stockholders in advance of

of Saturn Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to

the prior written consent of Halley, (D) to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the Saturn Stockholders Approval, or (E) in the event

Saturn Stockholders Meeting and the Halley Stockholders Meeting to be held on
the same day as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_; _provided_ , that
without the prior written consent of Halley, the Saturn Stockholders Meeting
may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30)
days after the date for which the Saturn Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled. Saturn shall, upon the reasonable request of Halley, provide the
aggregate vote tally of the proxies received with respect to the Saturn
Requisite Stockholder Approvals. Saturn shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than the tenth (10th) Business Day
following the date of this Agreement) conduct a "broker search" as
contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Saturn Stockholders Meeting (based on a
record date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the date on which
such broker search is commenced). If at any time the current record date for
the Saturn Stockholders Meeting is not reasonably likely to satisfy the
requirements of Saturns organizational documents and applicable Law, Saturn
shall, in consultation with Halley, set a new record date and shall continue
to comply with the "broker search" requirements of Rule 14a-13 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to any such new record date.

(c) _Halley Stockholders Meeting_. Halley shall use, irrespective of
whether the board of directors of Halley has made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is cleared by the SEC, in accordance with applicable Law,
the Halley Charter and the Halley Bylaws duly call, give notice of, convene

voting upon the approval of the Charter Amendment (as the components thereof
may be combined or separately required to be proposed or presented) and the
Share Issuance. Except during such time as an Adverse Recommendation Change is
in effect in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, Halley, through the board of directors of Halley,
shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they approve the Charter
Amendment (as the components thereof may be combined or separately required
to be proposed or presented) and the Share Issuance (the " _Halley
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (iii) solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Halley Stockholders Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Halley may adjourn or postpone the
Halley Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
provided to Halleys stockholders in advance of a vote to approve the Charter
Amendment (as the components thereof may be combined or separately required
to be proposed or presented) and the Share Issuance, (B) if, as of the time
for which the Halley Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Halley Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct Halley Stockholders
Meeting, (C) with the prior written consent of Saturn, (D) to solicit
additional proxies for

 



39  the purpose of obtaining the Halley Stockholders Approval, or (E) if the
Saturn Stockholder Meeting has been adjourned or postponed by Saturn in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ , to the extent necessary to enable
the Halley Stockholders Meeting and the Saturn Stockholders Meeting to be held
on the same day as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_; _provided_ , that
without the prior written consent of Saturn, the Halley Stockholders Meeting
may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days

aggregate vote tally of the proxies received with respect to the Halley

in no event later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of
this Agreement) conduct a "broker search" as contemplated by and in accordance
with Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to the
Halley Stockholders Meeting (based on a record date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the date on which such broker search is commenced). If
at any time the current record date for the Halley Stockholders Meeting is not
reasonably likely to satisfy the requirements of Halleys organizational
documents and applicable Law, Halley shall, in consultation with Saturn, set a
new record date and shall continue to comply with the "broker search"
requirements of Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to
any such new record date.

(d) _Merger Sub Approval_. Immediately following execution of this Agreement,
Halley shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
and in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub 1, a written consent
approving the First Merger and this Agreement.

protected by attorney/client privilege ( _provided_ that, with respect to
information that may be the subject of clauses (i) and (ii), Halley and its
Subsidiaries shall cooperate in good faith with Saturn and its
Representatives to disclose the subject information in an alternative manner

held confidential in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement entered into between Halley and Saturn dated as of March 22, 2017

the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or information
provided, made available or delivered to Saturn or Halley pursuant to this
Agreement shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties

42 Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Halley, Saturn and Merger Sub each agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers (the " _Saturn D andO Indemnified Parties_") of
Saturn or its Subsidiaries as provided in the Saturn Charter, the Saturn
Bylaws, the organizational documents of Saturns Subsidiaries or in any
contract to which Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as in effect
on the date of this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, whether claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby), shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and shall continue in
full force and effect following the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, Halley shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to Saturn DandO
Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and to
the fullest extent required by the Saturn Charter, the Saturn Bylaws, the
organizational documents of Saturns Subsidiaries or in any contract to which
Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that any Saturn DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced agrees to return any such funds to which a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Saturn DandO
Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled. For a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, Halley shall cause the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director and
officer liability that are no less favorable to the Saturn DandO Indemnified
Parties than those set forth in the Saturn Charter and the Saturn Bylaws as of
the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Saturn DandO Indemnified Parties.

(b) Halley, Saturn and Merger Sub each agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers (the " _Halley D andO Indemnified Parties_") of Halley or
its Subsidiaries as provided in the Halley Charter, the Halley Bylaws, the
organizational documents of Halleys Subsidiaries or in any contract to which
Halley or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on the date of this
Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, whether claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby),
shall continue in full force and effect following the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, Halley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to the Halley DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and to the fullest extent required by the Halley
Charter, the Halley Bylaws or in any contract to which Halley or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
, that any Halley DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced agrees
to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction
has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Halley DandO Indemnified
Party is not ultimately entitled. For a period of six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, Halley shall cause the organizational documents of Halley
to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and limitation of director and officer liability that are no less
favorable to the Halley DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the
Halley Charter and the Halley Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Halley DandO
Indemnified Parties.

 

(c) Unless Saturn shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time as provided below, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Halley shall cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of the
Saturn DandO Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an
insurer with the same or better credit rating as the current carrier for
Saturn that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Saturn D andO Insurance_")

 



43  covering each such person currently covered by the officers and directors
liability insurance policy of Saturn on terms with respect to coverage and in
amounts no less favorable than those of Saturns directors and officers
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Halley shall not be required to pay for the Saturn DandO
Insurance an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
Saturn for such coverage; and _provided_ , _further_ _,_ that if the cost for
such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual premium, Halley shall
obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding
such amount. Halleys obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_ may be
satisfied by Saturn purchasing, with the prior written consent of Halley (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) prior to the Effective
Time, a "tail" policy which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from
the Effective Time, and (ii) covers each person covered by Saturns directors
and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for
actions and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Unless Halley shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time as provided below, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Halley shall cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of the
Halley DandO Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an
insurer with the same or better credit rating as the current carrier for
Halley that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Halley D andO Insurance_") covering each such person
currently covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policy
of Saturn on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable
than those of Halleys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Halley shall not
be required to pay for the Halley DandO Insurance an amount in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently paid by Halley for such coverage; and provided,
further _,_ that if the cost for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such
annual premium, Halley shall obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Halleys obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_ may be satisfied by Halley purchasing, with the
prior written consent of Saturn (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) prior to the Effective Time, a "tail" policy which (i) has an
effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and (ii) covers each
person covered by Halleys directors and officers insurance policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement for actions and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) In the event that Halley, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Halley,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 

(f) The Saturn DandO Indemnified Parties and the Halley DandO Indemnified Parties
to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ applies shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and, from and after the Effective Time,
will be enforceable by, each of Saturn DandO Indemnified Parties and the Halley
DandO Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

release or other public statements disclosing or relating to a potential or
actual Adverse Recommendation Change, Acquisition Proposal, Superior
Proposal, Intervening Event or information related thereto, Halley and Saturn
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public

44  with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the parties shall not issue any such press release or make any public
statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Charter Amendment,
the Reverse Split, the Share Issuance or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned,
except that no consent shall be required to the extent such disclosure may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (in which case each party shall use reasonable best efforts
to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
statement in advance of such issuance).

 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Halley and
Saturn shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or

Subsidiaries not to, take any action that is reasonably likely to, or fail to

qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or the issuance of any of the Closing Tax
Opinions. 

(d) Halley shall not cause or permit Merger Sub 2 to elect to be treated, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, as other than an entity disregarded as

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the receipt by a party and
provision to the other party of such Closing Tax Opinion as provided herein,

and keep the other parties reasonably apprised with regard to all issues and
considerations arising out of the Second Merger Opt-Out Condition, including,
without limitation, whether each such party anticipates receiving a Closing
Tax Opinion that would satisfy such condition reasonably in advance of the

delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or
delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further

understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

Section 8.7  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this

Effective Time) shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _
5.10_. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party
beneficiaries under _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs.

Section 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related thereto, the relationship of the parties
hereto, and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of
the parties hereto, whether arising at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise, will be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules regarding
conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby.

 

Section 8.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
such court shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, solely in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement. Each of the
parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto
except in the courts described above in the State of Delaware, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of
the parties further agrees that notice as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. However, the foregoing shall
not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to deny or defeat personal
jurisdiction, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including by asserting (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts in the State
of Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

Section 8.10 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; 
_provided_ , however that that Halley may designate, by written notice to
Saturn, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a Delaware
corporation in lieu of Merger Sub 1, or another wholly-owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary that is a Delaware limited liability company in lieu of
Merger Sub 2, in which event all references herein to such Merger Sub shall be
deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations
and warranties made herein with respect to

 



60  such Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that each party shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement under any Law to post any
bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 8.12 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement
refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all purposes
in this Agreement.

Section 8.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible and the relevant
provision may be given effect to the fullest extent consistent with applicable
Law.

 

Section 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

 

Section 8.16 _Facsimile or PDF Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signature or by emailed portable document format (.pdf) file
signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute an original for
all purposes.

Section 8.17 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Halley, Merger
Sub and Saturn acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.

Amended and Restated Halley Charter AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

of

HRG GROUP, INC. 

HRG GROUP, INC. (the " _Corporation_ "), a corporation organized and existing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY AS FOLLOWS:

ONE: The name of the Corporation is HRG GROUP, INC. The original Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware on November 3, 2009. A Certificate of Amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware on July 13, 2015.

TWO: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this "
_Certificate_ "), was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to
time, the "DGCL"), having been (a) proposed by resolutions adopted and
declared advisable by the board of directors of the Corporation, and (b)
approved by the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL, and amends and
restates the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as amended) in
its entirety.

THREE: Pursuant to Section 103(d) of the DGCL, this Certificate will become
effective at [] Eastern Time on [], 2018 (the time upon which this
Certificate becomes effective being the " _Charter Amendment Effective Time_
").

 

FOUR: The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as amended) is
hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

 

1\. _Name_. The name of the Corporation is Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (the
" _Corporation_ ").

 

2\. _Address; Registered Office and Agent_. The address of the Corporations
registered office is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, State of Delaware 19808; and the name of its registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

 

3\. _Purposes_. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL.

4\. _Reverse Stock Split; Capital Stock_.

 

4.1 Effective immediately after the Charter Amendment Effective Time (such
time immediately after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the " _Reverse
Split Effective Time_ ") and without any further action by the holders of such
shares, each outstanding share of Common Stock (as defined below) shall be
consolidated into []1 of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of Common Stock (the " _Reverse Stock Split_ "). The par value of each
share of Common Stock shall not be adjusted in connection with the Reverse
Stock Split.

No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in the Reverse Stock
Split. In the event that, as a result of the Reverse Split, a stockholder of
the Corporation would hold a fractional share of Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares that would be held by such stockholder after
giving effect to the Reverse Split), such stockholders fractional share
shall be sold, and the proceeds therefrom remitted to such stockholder, as
follows: As promptly as practicable following the Charter Amendment Effective
Time, the Corporations existing transfer agent or another transfer agent
designated by Corporation (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") shall determine the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock stockholders of the Corporation
comprising the fractional shares of Common Stock to be sold pursuant to this
sentence (such excess shares being herein referred to as the " _Excess Shares_
"). As promptly as practicable following the Charter Amendment Effective Time,
the Transfer Agent, as agent for such stockholders (the " _Existing
Corporation Holders_ "), shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing
prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided herein. The sale of the Excess
Shares by the Transfer Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of
any such



   1  |

NTD: To equal the Halley Share Consolidation Ratio.  
  sale or sales have been distributed to Existing Corporation Holders, the
Transfer Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such Existing Corporation
Holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or sales of Excess Shares shall be
remitted to Existing Corporation Holders, reduced by any and all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any
expenses, of the Transfer Agent incurred in connection with such sale or
sales. The Transfer Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to
which each Existing Corporation Holder shall be entitled, if any,
by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such Existing Corporation Holder is entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Common Stock held by such Existing Corporation Holder immediately
prior to the effectuation of the Reverse Split and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) and the denominator of which is the
aggregate number of Excess Shares. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be remitted to Existing
Corporation Holders with respect to any fractional share interests, the
Transfer Agent shall promptly remit such amounts to such holders subject to
and in accordance with the foregoing. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such
fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
the Corporation. From and after the Reverse Split Time, certificates that
represented shares of Common Stock prior to the Reverse Split Time shall,
until presented for exchange, represent only the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares were combined pursuant to the Reverse Split.

4.2 From and after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the Corporation is
authorized to issue two classes of capital stock, designated as Common Stock
and Preferred Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that
the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 300,000,000, consisting of
200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ "), and 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, with a par value
of $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). Subject to the rights of any
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of
either of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased
(but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no
vote of the holders of either of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting
separately as a class shall be required therefor.

4.3 The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is hereby authorized to issue
the shares of Preferred Stock in such series, and to fix from time to time
before issuance, the number of shares to be included in any such series and
the designation, powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations
or restrictions of such series. The authority of the Board with respect to
each such series will include, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the determination of any or all of the following:

(a) the number of shares of any series and the designation to distinguish the
shares of such series from the shares of all other series;

(b) the voting powers, if any, and whether such voting powers are full or
limited in such series;

(c) the redemption provisions, if any, applicable to such series, including
the redemption price or prices to be paid;

(d) whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative, the
dividend rate of such series, and the dates and preferences of dividends on
such series;

 

(e) the rights of such series upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation
of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation;

(f) the provisions, if any, pursuant to which the shares of such series are
convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes
or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock, or
any other security, of the Corporation or any other corporation or other
entity, and the rates or other determinants of conversion or exchange
applicable thereto;

(g) the right, if any, to subscribe for or to purchase any securities of
the Corporation or any other corporation or other entity;

(h) the provisions, if any, of a sinking fund applicable to such series;

and (i) any other powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or
other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof;

all as may be determined from time to time by the Board and stated or
expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such
Preferred Stock (collectively, a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ "), and as
may be permitted by the DGCL.

 

4.4 Except as may otherwise be provided in this Certificate, by applicable
Law, or by a Preferred Stock Designation, each holder of Common Stock, as
such, shall have the exclusive right to vote, and shall be entitled to one
vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder, on all
matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote, including the
election of Directors to the Board. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to,
and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms
of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such
affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders
of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or pursuant to the
DGCL.

4.5 Subject to applicable Law and the rights, if any, of the holders of
outstanding Preferred Stock set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation, if
any, dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock at such times and
in such amounts as the Board in its discretion shall determine.

4.6 Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,
subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of
Preferred Stock set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to the stockholders ratably in proportion to
the number of shares held by them.

5\. _Election of Directors; Vacancies_.

 

5.1 Subject to any rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the
initial number of Directors shall be eight (8). Thereafter, the number of
Directors shall be determined by the Board. Unless and except to the extent
that the Corporations by-laws (the " _By-laws_ ") shall so require, the
election of Directors need not be by written ballot.

5.2 The Board (other than those Directors elected by the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock) shall be divided into three classes,
designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, with the first class initially
consisting of two Directors, and each other class initially consisting of
three Directors. The term of office of each class shall be three years and
shall expire in successive years at the time of the annual meeting of
stockholders. The Directors first appointed to Class I shall initially hold
office for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders
following the effectiveness of this Section 5.2; the Directors first appointed
to Class II shall initially hold office for a term expiring at the second
annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Section
5.2; and the Directors first appointed to Class III shall initially hold
office for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders
following the effectiveness of this Section 5.2. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term shall then
expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third
succeeding annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified
or until their earlier resignation, retirement, removal or death. Any
Director elected to fill a vacancy shall have the same remaining term as that
of his predecessor. In case of any increase or decrease, from time to time, in
the number of Directors (other than Directors elected by holders of any
series of Preferred Stock), the number of Directors in each class shall be
apportioned as nearly equal as possible. The members of the Board as of the
effective date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are
as follows:

 |  |  | III | 5.3 Directors, unless employed by and receiving a salary from the Corporation,
shall receive such compensation for serving on the Board and for attending
meetings of the Board and any committee thereof as may be fixed by the Board.
Directors shall be reimbursed their reasonable expenses incurred while engaged
in the business of the Corporation. 

6\. _Committees of the Board_. _General_. The Board may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors with
such power and authority as the Board determines.

7\. _Limitation of Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted under the
DGCL, no Director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or the
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any repeal
or amendment of this Article 7 or by changes in Law, or the adoption of any
other provision of this Certificate inconsistent with this Article 7, will,
unless otherwise required by Law, be prospective only, and will not in any way
diminish or adversely affect any right or protection of a Director existing
at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

8\. _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 

8.1 _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_ ") who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation or, while a
Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees)
reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or
part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of
such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in
advance by the Board.

 

8.2 _Advancement of Expenses_. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by a Covered Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition
of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the
Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately
determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article 8 or otherwise.

8.3 _Claims_.

 

(a) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, if a claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article 8 is not
paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Covered
Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit
to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. To
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, in any such action the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not
entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable Law.

(b) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a Covered Person seeking
to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a
defense that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable Law.
With respect to any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a
right to indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
(whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i)
the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to
commencement of such suit that indemnification of such Covered Person
is proper in the circumstances because such Covered Person has met the
applicable standards of conduct under applicable Law, nor (ii) an actual
determination by the Corporation that such Covered Person has not met such
applicable standards of conduct, shall create a presumption that such Covered
Person has not met the applicable standards of conduct or, in a case brought
by such Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification, be a
defense to such suit.

 

(c) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the
Corporation to prove that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the Covered Person from
whom the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this
Article 8 or otherwise. 8.4 _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by
this Article 8 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such Covered
Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this
Certificate or the By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Directors or
otherwise.

8.5 _Other Sources_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or to
advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise
shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person actually collects as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other entity or
enterprise; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Covered Person shall be required
to seek recovery from any other entity or enterprise.

 

8.6 _Amendment or Repeal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any repeal or amendment of this Article 8 by changes in Law (or
otherwise), or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate
inconsistent with this Article 8, will, unless otherwise required by Law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in Law permits
the Corporation to provide broader rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect
any right or protection of a Covered Person existing at the time of such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of
any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision, regardless of when the applicable action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which such right or protection is sought is
commenced and regardless of when such right or protection is sought.

expectancy in any such corporate opportunity.

13.1 _Purpose_. It is in the best interests of the Corporation and its
stockholders that certain restrictions on the Transfer of Corporation

to make a Transfer, whether in a single transaction (with any transactions
occurring on the same day being treated as a single transaction) or series of
related transactions, and any such purported Transfer will be void ab initio,
(A) to the extent that after giving effect to such purported Transfer: (i)
the purported transferee or any other Person by reason of the purported
transferees Acquisition would become a Substantial Holder; or (ii) the
Percentage Stock Ownership of a Person that, prior to giving effect to the
purported Transfer (or any series of Transfers of which such Transfer is a
part), is a Substantial Holder would be increased, or (B) if before giving
effect to such purported Transfer the purported transferor is a
Substantial Holder described in clause (a)(ii) of the definition of
"Substantial Holder" (any such purported Transfer described in clause (A) or
(B), a "Prohibited Transfer").

 

(b) The restrictions set forth in Section 13.3(a) shall not apply to a
proposed Transfer, and a Transfer shall not be treated as a Prohibited
Transfer hereunder, if the transferor or the transferee obtains approval of
the proposed Transfer by the Board (at a meeting of the Board or by written
consent of the Board). As a condition to granting its approval pursuant to
this Section 13.3(b), the Board may, in its sole discretion, require and/or
obtain (at the expense of the transferor and/or transferee) such
documentation, information and action, if any, as it determines,
including, without limitation, representations and warranties from the
transferor and/or transferee, such opinions of counsel to be rendered by
counsel selected by (or acceptable to) the Board, and such other advice, in
each case as to such matters as the Board determines in its sole discretion
is appropriate. Any such approval, once granted, shall be irrevocable,
provided that such information, documentation and representations and
warranties upon which such approval was based remain true, accurate and
complete prior to the applicable Transfer. (c) The restrictions set forth in Section 13.3(a) shall not preclude
the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (or any other national securities exchange or
other exchange on which the Corporation Securities are then traded) in the
Corporation Securities, it being understood, however, that any such
settlement shall not negate or otherwise affect the treatment of a Transfer as
a Prohibited Transfer hereunder.

 

(d) The restrictions set forth in Section 13.3(a) shall not apply to a
proposed Transfer, and a Transfer shall not be treated as a Prohibited
Transfer hereunder, if, at the time the proposed Transfer is effected, the
Board has reasonably determined, and publicly announced, that no Tax Benefits
of the Corporation may be carried forward.

 

13.4 _Excepted Transfers._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
other sections of this Article 13:

 

(a) (i) CF Turul LLC (" _CF_ _Turul_ "), an affiliate of Fortress Investment
Group LLC, an entity treated for U.S. tax purposes as a "partnership" and
currently the holder of [32,994,740 shares]2 of Common Stock (the " _CFT
Shares_ "), and (ii) its direct and indirect members, may make one or more
distributions of the CFT Shares or membership interests in CF Turul (other
than CFT Shares permitted to be Transferred pursuant to the other CF Turul
Exceptions) (such distributions described in this Section 13.4(a), the "CFT
_Distributions_ ," and such distributed CFT Shares or membership interests in
CF Turul, the " _CFT Distributed Property_ ") to the direct and indirect
members of CF Turul which are investment funds and accounts (including their
subsidiaries) managed by Fortress Investment Group LLC and/or its investment
advisory affiliates (each such Fortress-managed fund and account, a "
_Fortress Fund_ "), and by such Fortress Funds to the ultimate owners that
are (x) general partners of such Fortress Funds, and (y) direct investors in
such Fortress Funds that are not entities sponsored by Fortress Investment
Group LLC (or the nominees, custodians, or trustees of such direct investors,
including any liquidating trust or similar vehicle created to hold CFT
Distributed Property on behalf of direct investors who are precluded from
receiving or holding such CFT Distributed Property due to applicable law,
regulation, standing internal policy or other, similar constraints) (all such
general partners of and direct investors in such Fortress Funds, the "
_Ultimate Owners_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such CFT
Distributions may be made only on a substantially pro rata basis from CF
Turul to its direct and indirect members in their capacity as members,
partners, owners, or shareholders, successively, to the Ultimate Owners; (B)
such Fortress Funds may directly or indirectly hold, rather than distribute,
CFT Shares or membership interests in CF Turul (that otherwise would be
distributable to Ultimate Owners hereunder) on behalf of such Ultimate Owners
who do not receive such Distribution, provided that such Fortress Funds that
hold such CFT Shares shall not make a Disposition of such CFT Shares or
membership interests in CF Turul prior to the Expiration Date (as defined
below), other than to distribute such CFT Shares to the Ultimate Owners; (C)
prior to the Expiration Date, no CFT Distributions may be made if making the
CFT Distributions (together with any Dispositions by Ultimate Owners
undertaken as part of a plan in connection with such CFT Distribution) (1)
would result in the identification of a new Substantial Holder or Public
Group or (2) when combined with any prior CFT Distributions and any prior
Transfers made pursuant to the CF Turul Exceptions, cause an increase
(calculated as of the testing date that would occur as a result of such
Distribution) of more than the CFT Cushion Amount in the Percentage Stock
Ownership of any existing or new Substantial Holders or Public Groups; (D)
except as provided in (B), any Ultimate Owners may make a Disposition of the
CFT Shares constituting CFT Distributed Property at one or more times without
limitation, provided that the Dispositions are (1) made on a national
securities exchange or other exchange on which Corporate Securities are
then traded or (2) otherwise in compliance with Section 13.3 above; and (E)
prior to the Expiration Date, each CFT Distribution (together with any such
related Dispositions) shall be subject to the approval of the Board (at a
meeting of the Board or by written consent of the Board), which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned, that the conditions and
requirements for making a CFT Distribution as set forth in this Section
13.4(a) have been satisfied;  _provided_ , _that_ (x) as a condition to
granting such approval, CF Turul shall submit to the Board a plan for
effectuating the proposed CF Turul Distribution and shall provide the Board
with such other factual information, and representations with respect to such
factual information, as are reasonably requested by the

  Board in connection with its review of such plan, (y) CF Turul and the Board
shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether such proposed CF Turul
Distribution (together with any such related Dispositions) satisfies the
requirements of Section 13.4(a)(C), and (z) the Board shall promptly review
(or cause to be reviewed) such plan and use commercially reasonable efforts to
grant its approval of such plan within thirty (30) calendar days of the
receipt of such plan (the exceptions set forth in this Section 13.4(a) to
generally applicable limitations on Transfer, the " _CF Turul Distribution
Exceptions_ ").

 

(b) Following the earlier of (x) the date immediately following the first date
on which a Specified Closing occurs and (y) January 1, 2019, CF Turul may
make a Transfer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes both Acquisitions
and Dispositions) of Corporation Securities at one or more times, without
limitation; _provided_ that (i) prior to making any such Transfer occurring
before the Expiration Date, CF Turul demonstrates to the Boards reasonable
satisfaction that, calculated as of the testing date that would occur as a
result of such Transfer, the aggregate increase in the Percentage Stock
Ownership of any existing or new Substantial Holder or Public Group resulting
from (x) all such Transfers and (y) all CFT Distributions and Transfers made
pursuant to the CF Turul Exceptions, in each of cases (x) and (y), prior to
the Expiration Date will not exceed the CFT Cushion Amount and (ii) for the
avoidance of doubt, neither the limitations provided in this _Section_ __ _
13.4_ nor the limitations provided in  _Section_ __ _ 13.3_ hereof shall
apply to any Transfer by CF Turul that occurs on or after the Expiration Date
(the exceptions set forth in this Section 13.4(b) to generally applicable
limitations on Transfer, the " _CF Turul Other Transfer Exceptions_ "). CF
Turul shall promptly notify the Company of any Transfers made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_.

 

(c) CF Turul and the Fortress Funds may (i) sell the aggregate of the
fractional CFT Shares (not to exceed 2000 CFT Shares) that would result if CF
Turul or the Fortress Funds, as applicable, were to make a pro rata CFT
Distribution of all of their CFT Shares to the Ultimate Owners pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 13.4(a)_, and (ii) make one or more distributions of the cash
proceeds of such sales (the exceptions set forth in this Section 13.4(c) to
generally applicable limitations on Transfer, the " _CF Turul Fractional Share
Exceptions_ " and, collectively with the CF Turul Distribution Exceptions and
the CF Turul Other Transfer Exceptions, the " _CF Turul Exceptions_ ").

(d) Leucadia National Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Leucadia_ "), currently the holders of [46,632,180 shares]3
of Common Stock (the " _Leucadia Shares_ "), may make one or more
distributions of all of the Leucadia Shares (other than Leucadia Shares
permitted to be sold pursuant to the other Leucadia Exceptions) (such
distributions pursuant to this Section 13.4(d), the " _Leucadia
Distributions_ ," and such distributed Leucadia Shares, the " _Leucadia
Distributed Property_ ") to the shareholders of Leucadia (or the nominees,
custodians, or trustees of such shareholders, including any liquidating trust
or similar vehicle created to hold Leucadia Distributed Property on behalf of
any such shareholders who are precluded from receiving or holding such
Leucadia Distributed Property due to applicable law, regulation, standing
internal policy or other, similar constraints) (all such shareholders, as of
the time of any such Leucadia Distribution, the " _Leucadia Shareholders_ ");
_provided, however_ , that (i) any such Leucadia Distribution may be made only
on a pro rata basis from Leucadia to the Leucadia Shareholders; (ii) prior to
the Expiration Date, no such Leucadia Distribution may be made if making the
Leucadia Distribution (together with any Dispositions by Ultimate Owners
undertaken as part of a plan in connection with such Leucadia Distribution)
(1) would result in the identification of a new Substantial Holder or Public
Group or (2) when combined with any prior Leucadia Distributions and any prior
Transfers made pursuant to the Leucadia Exceptions, cause an increase
(calculated as of the testing date that would occur as a result of such
Distribution) of more than the Leucadia Cushion Amount in the Percentage Stock
Ownership of any existing or new Substantial Holders or Public Groups; (iii)
any Leucadia Shareholders may make a Disposition of the Leucadia Shares
constituting Leucadia Distributed Property at one or more times without
limitation, provided that the Dispositions are (1) made on a

any such related Dispositions) shall be subject to the approval of the Board
(at a meeting of the Board or by written consent of the Board), which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, that the
conditions and requirements for making a Leucadia Distribution as set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(d)_ have been satisfied; _provided_ , _that_ (A)
as a condition to granting

to determine whether such proposed Leucadia Distribution (together with any

(the exceptions set forth in this Section 13.4(d) to generally applicable
limitations on Transfer, the " _Leucadia Distribution Exceptions_ ").

date on which a Specified Closing occurs and (y) January 1, 2019, Leucadia may
Transfer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes both Acquisitions and
Dispositions) Leucadia Shares at one or more times, without limitation;
_provided_ that (i) prior to making any such Transfer occurring before the
Expiration Date, Leucadia demonstrates to the Boards reasonable satisfaction
that, calculated as of the testing date that would occur as a result of such
Transfer, the aggregate increase in the Percentage Stock Ownership of any
existing or new Substantial Holder or Public Group resulting from (x) all such
Transfers and (y) all Leucadia Distributions and Transfers made pursuant to
the Leucadia Exceptions, in each of cases (x) and (y), prior to the Expiration
Date will not exceed the Leucadia Cushion Amount and (ii) for the avoidance of
doubt, neither the limitations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 13.4_ nor the
limitations provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.3_ hereof shall apply to any
Transfer by Leucadia that occurs on or after the Expiration Date (the
exceptions set forth in this Section 13.4(e) to generally applicable

of the Leucadia Shares and the CFT Shares.

(ii) " _Cushion Amount_ " means the excess, if any, of (i) 47.5% over (ii)
the sum, determined as of the effective date of the Merger, of the increases
(if any) in Percentage Stock Ownership of each Substantial Holder described
in clause (ii) of the definition thereof and of each Public Group, as of such
date, over the three-year period ending on the effective date of the Merger
(for the avoidance of doubt, with such increase measured in each case against
such Substantial Holders and Public Groups lowest Percentage Stock
Ownership during such period).

(iii) " _Expiration Date_ " means the earliest to occur of (A) the date that
the limitations on Transfer imposed by this Article 13 no longer apply to
Corporation Securities; (B) the date as of which the Board has determined

constructive ownership rules apply as no longer owned by that entity shall
instead apply.

13.5 _Treatment of Excess Securities_.

 

(a)

 

(i) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited
Transfer, and the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer (the "
_Purported Transferee_ ") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the
Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation
Securities that are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the " _Excess
Securities_ "). The Purported Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to
such Excess Securities to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation,
including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities, to
receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in
respect thereof and to effect any Transfer thereof. Once the Excess Securities
have been acquired in a Transfer that is in accordance with this Section 13.5
and is not a Prohibited Transfer, such Corporation Securities shall cease to
be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.5 shall also be a
Prohibited Transfer.

 

(ii) The Corporation may require, including, but not limited to, as a
condition to the registration of the Transfer of any Corporation Securities
or the payment of any dividend or distribution on any Corporation Securities,
that the proposed transferee or payee furnish to the Corporation all
information reasonably requested by the Corporation with respect to all
the direct or indirect ownership interests in such Corporation Securities.
The Corporation may make such arrangements or issue such instructions to its
stock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board to be necessary or
advisable to implement this Section 13.5, including, without limitation,
authorizing such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a proposed
transferee or payee regarding such Persons actual and constructive ownership
of stock and other evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this
Article 13 as a condition to registering any Transfer or paying any dividend
or distribution.

 

(b)

 

(i) If a Prohibited Transfer has occurred: (1) the Prohibited Transfer and, if
applicable, the registration of such Prohibited Transfer, shall be void _ab
initio_ and have no legal effect; and (2) upon written demand by the
Corporation, the Purported Transferee (if identified by the Corporation or
otherwise) shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other
evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported
Transferees possession or control, together with any dividends or other
distributions that were received by the Purported Transferee from the
Corporation with respect to the Excess Securities (the " _Prohibited
Distributions_ "), to an agent designated and controlled by the Board (the "
_Agent_ ").

 

(ii) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Section 13.3(a)(A)
(other than as a result of the consummation of the Merger), the Agent shall
thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers the Excess Securities transferred to it
pursuant to this Section 13.5(b) in one or more arms-length transactions
(including over a national securities exchange on which the Corporation
Securities may be traded, if possible); provided, however, that the Agent, in
its sole discretion, shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and
shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame
if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for
the Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of
the Corporation Securities; provided further that any such sale must not
constitute a Prohibited Transfer. If the Purported Transferee has resold the
Excess Securities before receiving the Corporations demand to surrender the
Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to
have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to
transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and the proceeds of such
sale (in the form received, _i.e._ , whether in cash or other property), and
the Agent shall thereupon identify and sell any non-cash consideration to a
buyer or buyers in one or more arms-length transactions (including over a
national securities exchange, if possible), except to the extent the
Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a
portion of such sale proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported
Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 13.5(c) if
the Agent, rather than the Purported Transferee, had resold the Excess
Securities. (iii) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Section 13.3(a)(A) as
a result of the consummation of the Merger (for this purpose, treating as a
Prohibited Transfer any issuance of Corporation Securities that would have
constituted a Prohibited Transfer but for the operation of section 2.1(e) of
the Merger Agreement and the applicable provisions of this Article 13), the
Agent shall, at the direction of the Company, thereupon deliver the Excess
Securities to (i) one or more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3)
of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) (" _Section_ __ _
501(c)(3)_") as determined in the Companys sole discretion and/or (ii)
escheat such property to the state of residence or incorporation or formation,
as applicable, of the Purported Transferee for the benefit of such state.

(iv) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Section 13.3(a)(B),
the purported transferor of Excess Securities in such Prohibited Transfer (the
" _Purported Transferor_ ") shall deliver to the Agent the sale proceeds from
the Prohibited Transfer (in the form received, _i.e.,_ whether in cash or
other property), and the Agent shall thereupon identify and sell any non-cash
consideration to a buyer or buyers in one or more arms-length transactions
(including over a national securities exchange, if possible). If the identity
of the Purported Transferee is determined (by the Corporation), the Agent
shall, to the extent possible, return to the Purported Transferor any
certificate or evidence of ownership of Excess Securities together with any
Prohibited Distributions received by the Agent pursuant to this Section
13.5(b), and shall reimburse the Purported Transferee up to an amount paid by
such Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities in the Prohibited
Transfer, such reimbursement to be made from (and limited to) the sale
proceeds received by the Agent from the Purported Transferor (and the
net proceeds realized by the Agent from the disposition of any non-cash
consideration). If the identity of the Purported Transferee is not determined,
or to the extent the Excess Securities have been resold and thus cannot be
returned to the Purported Transferor, the Agent shall use the proceeds
received by the Agent from the Purported Transferor (and the net proceeds
realized by the Agent from the disposition of any non-cash consideration) to
acquire on behalf of the Purported Transferor, in one or more arms-length
transactions (including over a national securities exchange on which the
Corporation Securities may be traded, if possible), an equal amount of
Corporation Securities in replacement of the Excess Securities sold; provided,
however, that to the extent the amount of proceeds is not sufficient to fund
the purchase price of such Corporation Securities and the Agents costs and
expenses (as described in Section 13.5(c)), the Purported Transferor shall
promptly fund such deficiency upon demand by the Agent.

 

(iv) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer that is described in both Sections
13.3(a)(A) and 13.3(a)(B), the procedures set forth in Section 13.5(b)(ii)
shall apply.

(c) Except for Prohibited Distributions that are to be returned to
the Purported Transferor in accordance with Section 13.5(b)(ii), the Agent
shall apply any proceeds or any other amounts received by it by and in
accordance with Section 13.5 as follows:

 

(i) _first_ , such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary
to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties
hereunder;

(ii) _second_ , any remaining amounts shall be paid to the
Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for
the Excess Securities (or the fair market value at the time of the Prohibited
Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in
whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Transfer); and

(iii) _third_ , any remaining amounts, subject to the limitations imposed
by the following proviso, shall be paid to one or more organizations
qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) selected by the Board; provided, however,
that if the Excess Securities (including any Excess Securities arising from a
previous Prohibited Transfer not sold by the Agent in a prior sale or sales)
represent a 4.9% or greater Percentage Stock Ownership interest in the
Corporation, then such remaining amounts shall be paid to two or more
unrelated organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) selected by the
Board, such that no organization qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) shall
possess Percentage Stock Ownership in the Corporation of 4.9% or more. (iv) The recourse of any Purported Transferee in respect of any
Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported
Transferee pursuant to clause (ii) above. Except to the extent used to cover
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder,
in no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to
this Section 13.5 inure to the benefit of the Corporation.

(d) If the Purported Transferee or the Purported Transferor fails to
surrender the Excess Securities (as applicable) or the proceeds of a sale
thereof to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Corporation makes a demand pursuant to Section 13.5(b), then the Corporation
shall, in such manner and at such time, as determined by the Board, use its
best efforts to enforce the provisions hereof, which may include the
institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this
Section 13.5(d) shall (i) be deemed inconsistent with any Prohibited Transfer
of the Excess Securities provided in this Article 13 being void _ab initio_ or
(ii) preclude the Corporation in its discretion from immediately bringing
legal proceedings without a prior demand.

(e) In the event of any Prohibited Transfer that does not involve a transfer
of Corporation Securities within the meaning of the DGCL and that is not a
Prohibited Transfer pursuant to Section 13.3(a)(B), the application of Section
13.5(b)-(d) shall be modified as described in this Section 13.5(e). In such
case, no such Purported Transferee shall be required to dispose of any
interest that is not a Corporation Security, but such Purported Transferee
and/or any Person whose ownership of Corporation Securities is attributed to
such Purported Transferee (such Purported Transferee or other Person, a "
_Remedial Holder_ ") shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required
to dispose of sufficient Corporation Securities (which Corporation Securities
shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to
cause such Purported Transferee, following such disposition, not to be in
violation of this Article 13. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur
simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this
provision, and such number of Corporation Securities that are deemed to be
disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of
through the Agent as provided in Section 13.5(b)-(d), except that the maximum
aggregate amount payable to a Remedial Holder in connection with such sale
shall be the fair market value of such Excess Securities at the time of the
Prohibited Transfer. A Remedial Holder shall not be entitled, with respect to
such Excess Securities, to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation,
including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to
receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in
respect thereof, if any, following the time of the Prohibited Transfer. All
expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be
paid out of any amounts due to such Remedial Holder. The purpose of this
Section 13.5(e) is to extend the restrictions in Section 13.5(b)-(d) to
situations in which there is a Prohibited Transfer without a direct Transfer
of Corporation Securities, and this Section 13.5(e), along with the other
provisions of this Article 13, shall be interpreted to produce the same
results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of
Corporation Securities.

13.6 _Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any stockholder
subject to the provisions of this Article 13 who knowingly violates the
provisions of this Article 13 and any Persons controlling, controlled by or
under common control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally
liable to the Corporation for, and shall indemnify and hold the Corporation
harmless against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation,
including, but not limited to, damages resulting from a reduction in,
or elimination of, the Corporations ability to utilize its Tax Benefits, and
attorneys and auditors fees incurred in connection with such violation.

 

13.7 _Bylaws; Legends; Compliance_.

 

(a) The Bylaws may make appropriate provisions to effectuate the requirements
of this Article 13.

 

(b) All certificates (including global certificates) issued by the Corporation
representing Corporation Securities shall bear a conspicuous legend
substantially in the form as follows:

"THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 13 OF THE AMENDED AND

its stock transfer records and instruct any transfer agent, registrar,
securities intermediary or depository with respect to the requirements of this
Article 13 for any uncertificated Corporation Securities or Corporation
Securities held in an indirect holding system. 

(d) The Board shall have the power to decide all matters necessary for
determining compliance with this Article 13, including, without limitation,

Substantial Holder or other Person, (D) whether an instrument constitutes a
Corporation Security, (E) the amount (or fair market value) due to a Purported
Transferee or Purported Transferor pursuant to this Article 13, (F) to
interpret any provision of this Article 13, and (G) any other matter that the
Board determines to be relevant. The good faith determination of the Board on
such matters shall be conclusive and binding on all persons and entities for
the purposes of this Article 13.

 

13.8 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article 13 shall
be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity
or circumstances for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions
in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article
13 (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this
Article 13 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and
circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

13.9 The restrictions on transfer and ownership imposed by this Article 13
will expire on the close of business on the effective date of the repeal of
Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board reasonably
determines that such restrictions are no longer necessary or desirable for
the preservation of Tax Benefits.

(A) A meeting of Stockholders for the election of Directors and other

in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be
conducted. To be properly brought before an annual meeting of
Stockholders, such business must be brought before the meeting (i) by or at
the direction of the Board or any committee thereof or (ii) by a Stockholder

nominations or elections of Directors which is governed by Section 3.4 and (y)
with respect to proposals where the Stockholder proposing such business has
notified the Corporation of such Stockholders intent to present the proposals
at an annual meeting in compliance with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and
such proposals have been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared
by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting, in which case
the notice requirements of this Section 2.2 shall be deemed satisfied with
respect to such proposals.

 

(C) At any annual meeting of Stockholders, all proposals of Stockholder
Business must be made by timely written notice given by a Stockholder of
record (the " _Notice of Business_ ") and must otherwise be a proper matter
for Stockholder action. To be timely, the Notice of Business must be delivered
personally or mailed to, and received at, the Office of the
Corporation, addressed to the Secretary, by no earlier than 120 days and no
later than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the prior

the annual meeting of Stockholders is advanced by more than 30 days, or
delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the prior years
annual meeting of Stockholders or (ii) no annual meeting was held during the
prior year, then the notice by the Stockholder to be timely must be received
(a) no earlier than 120 days before such annual meeting and (b) no later than
the later of 90 days before such annual meeting and the tenth day after the
day on which the notice of such annual meeting was made by mail or Public
Disclosure. In no event shall an adjournment, postponement or deferral, or
Public Disclosure of an adjournment, postponement or deferral, of an annual
meeting of Stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of the Notice of Business.

others (including their names) acting in concert with any of the foregoing,
(d) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including
any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging
transactions and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into,
directly or indirectly, as of the date of the Proponents notice by, or on
behalf of, the Proponent or any Stockholder Associated Person, the effect or
intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price
changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of the Proponent or any
Stockholder Associated Person with respect to shares of stock of the
Corporation (a " _Derivative_ "), (e) a description in reasonable detail of
any proxy (including revocable proxies), contract, arrangement, understanding
or other relationship pursuant to which the Proponent or Stockholder
Associated Person has a right to vote any shares of stock of the Corporation,
(f) any rights to dividends on the stock of the Corporation owned beneficially

reasons for conducting such Stockholder Business at the meeting;

(vi) any material interest of the Proponent and any Stockholder Associated
Person in such Stockholder Business; 

(vii) a representation as to whether the Proponent intends (a) to deliver a

(viii) all other information that would be required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") if the Proponents or
Stockholder Associated Persons were participants in a solicitation subject to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act.

(E) The person presiding over the meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting, that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.2, and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the
meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall
not be transacted.

 

(F) If the Proponent (or a qualified representative of the Proponent) does not
appear at the annual meeting of Stockholders to present the Stockholder
Business such business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For
purposes of this Section 2.2, to be considered a qualified representative of
the Stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or
partner of such Stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by
such Stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such Stockholder
to act for such Stockholder as proxy at the annual meeting of Stockholders
and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a

common control with, the Stockholder or such beneficial owner. 

(I) " _Control_ " (including the terms " _controlling_ ," " _controlled by_ "
and " _under common control with_ ") means the possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and
policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise.

 

(J) Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the
holders of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation pursuant to any
applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation.

2.3 _Special Meetings_.

 

(A) Special meetings of Stockholders may be called at any time by the Board by
giving notice to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting in
accordance with Section 2.5 hereof. Business transacted at any special meeting
of Stockholders called by the Board shall be limited to the purposes stated in
the notice.

 

(B) Special meetings of Stockholders shall be called by the Board upon written
request to the Secretary of one or more record holders of shares of stock of
the Corporation representing in the aggregate not less than 25% of the total
number of shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter or
matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. A request to
the Secretary shall be signed by the Stockholder or Stockholders, or a duly
authorized agent of such Stockholder or Stockholders, requesting a special
meeting (a " _Special Meeting Request_ "). A special meeting requested by
Stockholders shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the
state of Delaware as may be fixed by the Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the date of any such special meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the
Special Meeting Request is received by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a special meeting requested by Stockholders shall not be held if
(i) the Special Meeting Request(s) relates to an item of business that is not
a proper subject for Stockholder action under applicable law, (ii) the
Special Meeting Request(s) is received by the Corporation during the period
commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next
annual meeting, (iii) an identical or substantially similar item (as
determined in good faith by the Board, a " _Similar Item_ ") was presented at
a meeting of the Stockholders held within 90 days prior to receipt by the
Corporation of such Special Meeting Request(s) (and, for purposes of this
Section 2.3(B), the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item"
with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal
of directors), (iv) the Board calls an annual or special meeting of
Stockholders to be held not later than 90 days after the Secretarys receipt
of the Special Meeting Request(s) and a Similar Item is included in the
Corporations notice as an item of business to be brought before such annual
or special meeting of Stockholders, (v) a Similar Item is already included in
the Corporations notice as an item of business to be brought before a meeting
of the Stockholders that has been called but not yet held, or (vi) the
Special Meeting Request(s) was made in a manner that involved a violation of
Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. A Stockholder may revoke a Special
Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary,
and if, following such revocation, there are unrevoked requests from
Stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of shares
entitling the Stockholders to make a Special Meeting Request, the Board, in
its discretion, may cancel such special meeting. Business transacted at a
special meeting requested by Stockholders shall be limited to the matters
described in the Special Meeting Request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall prohibit the Board from submitting matters to the
Stockholders at any special meeting requested by Stockholders.

(C) The Special Meeting Request must set forth:

(i) the Stockholder Information with respect to each Stockholder proposing
Stockholder Business for a special meeting (the " _Requesting Person_ ");

(ii) the name and address of any Stockholder Associated Person;

 

(iii) a representation that each Requesting Person is a holder of record of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such Stockholder
Business; (iv) a brief description of the Stockholder Business desired to be brought
before the special meeting, the text of the proposal (including the text of
any resolutions proposed for consideration and, if such Stockholder Business
includes a proposal to amend the By-laws, the language of the
proposed amendment) and the reasons for conducting such Stockholder Business;

(v) any material interest of the Requesting Person and any Stockholder
Associated Person in such Stockholder Business;

(vi) a representation as to whether the Requesting Person intends (a)
to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Corporations outstanding capital stock required to approve
or adopt such Stockholder Business or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies or
votes from Stockholders in support of such Stockholder Business; and

(vii) all other information that would be required to be filed with the SEC
if the Requesting Persons or Stockholder Associated Persons were participants
in a solicitation subject to Section 14 of the Exchange Act.

 

(D) If the Requesting Person (or a qualified representative of the Requesting
Person) does not appear at the special meeting of Stockholders to present the
Stockholder Business such business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding
that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the
Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.3, to be considered a
qualified representative of the Stockholder, a person must be a duly
authorized officer, manager or partner of such Stockholder or must be
authorized by a writing executed by such Stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such Stockholder to act for such Stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of Stockholders and such person must produce such writing
or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or
electronic transmission, at the meeting of Stockholders.

 

(E) Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the
holders of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation pursuant to any
applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation.

2.4 _Record Date_.

 

(A) For the purpose of determining the Stockholders entitled to notice of any
meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof, unless otherwise required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable Law, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the
resolution fixing the record date was adopted by the Board and shall not be
more than 60 days or less than ten days before the date of such meeting.
Subject to Section 2.13, for the purposes of determining the Stockholders
entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
unless otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable
Law, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date on which the resolution fixing the record date was adopted by the Board
and shall not be more than ten days after the date on which the record date
was fixed by the Board. For the purposes of determining the Stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights, exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock or take any other lawful action, unless otherwise required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable Law, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which
the resolution fixing the record date was adopted by the Board and shall not
be more than 60 days prior to such action.

(B) Subject to Section 2.13, if no such record date is fixed:

(i) The record date for determining Stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall be at the close of business on the
day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business
on the day on which the meeting is held;

 

(ii) The record date for determining Stockholders entitled to express consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting (unless otherwise provided
in the Certificate of Incorporation), when no prior action by the Board is
required by applicable Law, shall be the first day on which a signed written
consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered
to the Corporation in accordance with applicable Law; and when prior action
by the Board is required by applicable Law, the record date for determining
Stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the
Board takes such prior action; and

(iii) When a determination of Stockholders of record entitled to notice of or
to vote at any meeting of Stockholders has been made as provided in this
Section 2.4, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for
determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix as the record date for Stockholders entitled to
notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for
determination of Stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the
foregoing provisions. 2.5 _Notice of Meetings of Stockholders_. Whenever under the provisions of
applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws,
Stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice
shall be given stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting,
the means of remote communication, if any, by which Stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the
record date for determining the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting,
if such date is different from the record date for determining Stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by
these By-laws or applicable Law, notice of any meeting shall be given, not
less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, to each
Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for
determining the Stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. mail, with
postage prepaid, directed to the Stockholder at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary, an
Assistant Secretary or the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice
required by this Section 2.5 has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. If a meeting is adjourned
to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. Any business that might have been transacted at the
meeting as originally called may be transacted at the adjourned meeting. If,
however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each Stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for Stockholders entitled
to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record
date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section
213(a) of the DGCL, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each
Stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the
record date for notice of such adjourned meeting.

 

2.6 _Waivers of Notice_. Whenever the giving of any notice to Stockholders is
required by applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
laws, a waiver thereof, given by the person entitled to said notice, whether
before or after the event as to which such notice is required, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance by a Stockholder at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except when the Stockholder
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the
meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purposes of, any regular or special meeting of the
Stockholders need be specified in any waiver of notice.

 

2.7 _List of Stockholders_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger
shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
Stockholders, a complete, alphabetical list of the Stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting and showing the address of each Stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each Stockholder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the record date for determining the Stockholders entitled to vote is
less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the
Stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date and
the address of each such Stockholder and the number of shares registered in
the name of such Stockholder. Such list may be examined by any Stockholder, at
the Stockholders expense, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a
period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation or on a reasonably
accessible electronic network as provided by applicable Law. If the meeting is
to be held at a place, a list of Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any Stockholder who is present.
If the meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, the
list shall also be open for inspection as provided by applicable Law. Except
as provided by applicable Law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as
to who are the Stockholders entitled to examine the list of Stockholders or to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders.

2.8 _Quorum of Stockholders; Adjournment_. Except as otherwise provided by any
applicable Law or these By-laws, at each meeting of Stockholders, the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
at the meeting of Stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of any business at such meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation present in
person or represented by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders, including an
adjourned meeting, and entitled to vote thereon may adjourn such meeting to
another time and place. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation
or to any of its subsidiaries shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not
limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

2.9 _Voting; Proxies_. At any meeting of Stockholders, all matters, except as
otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws or any
applicable Law, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority in
voting power of shares of stock of the Corporation present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon. At all meetings of
Stockholders for the election of Directors, a plurality of the votes cast
shall be sufficient to elect. Each Stockholder entitled to  vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to express consent or dissent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or
persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy but no such proxy shall be voted
or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a
longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in Law to support an irrevocable power. A Stockholder may revoke
any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by delivering to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or by
delivering a new proxy bearing a later date.

2.10 _Voting Procedures and Inspectors at Meetings of Stockholders_. The
Board, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, may appoint one or more
inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and
make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the person presiding at
the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall
take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The
inspectors shall (A) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting
power of each, (B) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the
validity of proxies and ballots, (C) count all votes and ballots, (D)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of
any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (E) certify
their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and
their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain
other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of
their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date and time of the
opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the
Stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the
person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No
ballot, proxies, votes or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be
accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application by a Stockholder shall
determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of Stockholders, the inspectors may consider such
information as is permitted by applicable Law. No person who is a candidate
for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.

2.11 _Conduct of Meetings; Adjournment_. The Board may adopt such rules and
procedures for the conduct of meetings of Stockholders as it deems
appropriate. At each meeting of Stockholders, the President or, in the absence
of the President, the Chief Executive Officer or, in the absence of the Chief
Executive Officer, the Chairman or, if there is no Chairman or if there be one
and the Chairman is absent, a Vice President and, in case more than one Vice
President shall be present, that Vice President designated by the Board (or
in the absence of any such designation, the most senior Vice President
present), shall preside over the meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent
with the rules and procedures as adopted by the Board, the person presiding
over the meeting of Stockholders shall have the right and authority to
convene, adjourn and reconvene the meeting from time to time, to prescribe
such additional rules and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the
judgment of such person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the
meeting. Such rules and procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed
by the person presiding over the meeting, may include, (A) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting, (B) rules and procedures
for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, (C)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to Stockholders
of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies
or such other persons as the person presiding over the meeting shall
determine, (D) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
the commencement thereof and (E) limitations on the time allotted to questions
or comments by participants. The person presiding over any meeting of
Stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, may determine and declare to the
meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting
and if such presiding person should so determine, he or she shall so declare
to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of
Stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure. The Secretary or, in his or her absence, one of
the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. If none of
the officers above designated to act as the person presiding over the meeting
or as secretary of the meeting shall be present, a person presiding over the
meeting or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be
designated by the Board and, if the Board has not so acted, in the case of the
designation of a person to act as secretary of the meeting, designated by the
person presiding over the meeting. 

2.12 _Order of Business_. The order of business at all meetings of
Stockholders shall be as determined by the person presiding over the meeting.

2.13 _Written Consents of Stockholders Without a Meeting_.

 

(A) Any person seeking to have the Stockholders authorize or take corporate
action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice
addressed to the Secretary and delivered to the Corporation, request that a
record date be fixed for such purpose. The Board shall promptly, but in all
events within ten days after the date on which such written notice   is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date
has previously been fixed by the Board pursuant to Section 2.4). If no record
date has been fixed by the Board by ten days after the date on which such
written notice is received, the record date for determining Stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action by the Board is required by applicable Law, shall be as
specified in Section 2.4(B)(ii).

(B) Any action to be taken at any annual or special meeting of Stockholders
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action to be so taken, shall
be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the Corporation having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested) to the Corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of Stockholders are recorded. Every written
consent shall bear the date of signature of each Stockholder who signs the
consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated
consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 2.13, written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered
to the Corporation as aforesaid. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the
extent required by applicable Law, be given to those Stockholders who have not
consented in writing, and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE III

_DIRECTORS _

3.1 _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board. The Board may adopt such

Board. Each Director shall hold office until a successor is duly elected and
qualified or until the Directors earlier death, resignation, disqualification
or removal.

 

3.3 _Classified Board of Directors_. The Board shall be classified as set
forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. The members of each class shall

Section 3.4 is delivered to the Secretary and at the time of the meeting, (b)
is entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting and (c)
complies with the notice and other provisions of this Section 3.4. Subject to
any rights set forth in an agreement with the Corporation, Section 3.4(C)(ii)
is the exclusive means by which a Stockholder may nominate a person for
election to the Board. Persons nominated in accordance with Section 3.4(C)(ii)
are referred to as " _Stockholder Nominees_ ". A Stockholder nominating
persons for election to the Board is referred to as the " _Nominating
Stockholder_ ". (D) All nominations of Stockholder Nominees must be made by timely written
notice given by or on behalf of a Stockholder of record of the Corporation
(the " _Notice of Nomination_ "). To be timely, the Notice of Nomination must
be delivered personally or mailed to and received at the Office of the
Corporation, addressed to the attention of the Secretary, by the following
dates:

(i) in the case of the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee for election to the
Board at an annual meeting of Stockholders, no earlier than 120 days and no
later than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the prior
years annual meeting of Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (a)
the annual meeting of Stockholders is advanced by more than 30 days, or
delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the prior years
annual meeting of Stockholders or (b) no annual meeting was held during the
prior year, notice by the Stockholder to be timely must be received (1) no
earlier than 120 days before the date of such annual meeting and (2) no later
than the later of 90 days before the date of such annual meeting and the tenth
day after the date on which the notice of such annual meeting was made by

before the date of such special meeting and (b) no later than the later of 90
days before the date of such special meeting and the tenth day after the date
on which the notice of such special meeting was made by mail or Public

(E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the number of Directors to

after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under this
Section 3.4 and there is no Public Disclosure by the Corporation naming the
nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days before the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a Notice of Nomination
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships, if it shall be delivered personally and received at
the Office of the Corporation, addressed to the attention of the Secretary, no
later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which
such Public Disclosure is first made by the Corporation.

(F) In no event shall an adjournment, postponement or deferral, or Public
Disclosure of an adjournment, postponement or deferral, of an annual or
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of the Notice of Nomination.

 

(G) The Notice of Nomination shall set forth:

 

(i) the Stockholder Information with respect to each Nominating Stockholder
and Stockholder Associated Person;

 

(ii) a representation that each Stockholder nominating a Stockholder Nominee
is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the
meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose
such nomination;

(iii) all information regarding each Stockholder Nominee and Stockholder
Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a solicitation of
proxies subject to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, the written consent of each
Stockholder Nominee to being named in a proxy statement as a nominee and to
serve if elected;

(iv) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other
material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past
three years, and any other material relationships, between or among a
Nominating Stockholder, Stockholder Associated Person or their respective
associates, or others acting in concert therewith, including all information
that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under
Regulation S-K if the Nominating Stockholder, Stockholder Associated Person or
any person acting in concert therewith, was the "registrant" for purposes of
such rule and the Stockholder Nominee was a director or executive of such
registrant;

 

(v) with respect to any and all of the agreements, contracts, understandings,
arrangements, proxies or other relationships referred to in the foregoing
subclauses (iii) and (iv), a representation that such Nominating Stockholder
will notify the Corporation in writing of any such agreement, contract,
understanding, arrangement, proxy or other relationship that are or will be in
effect as of the date of such annual meeting no later than five business days
before the date of such meeting;

(vi) a representation as to whether such Nominating Stockholder intends (a)
to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Corporations outstanding capital stock required to approve
the nomination or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies or votes from Stockholders
in support of such nomination;

(vii) all other information that would be required to be filed with the SEC
if the Nominating Stockholders and Stockholder Associated Person were
participants in a solicitation subject to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and (viii) any other information requested by the Corporation of either the
Nominating Stockholder or the Stockholder Nominee as the Corporation may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to
serve as a Director; _provided_ , that such request must be made within five
business days of the Corporations receipt of the Notice of Nomination.

(H) If the Nominating Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee (as applicable) does
not provide the information required by Section 3.4(G)(viii) within ten
business days after the Corporations request, then such Nominating
Stockholders proposal shall be disregarded. In addition, the person presiding
over the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the
meeting that any proposed nomination of a Stockholder Nominee was not made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.4 and, if he or she
should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and the
defective nomination shall be disregarded.

(I) If the Stockholder (or a qualified representative of the Stockholder)
does not appear at the applicable meeting of Stockholders to nominate the
Stockholder Nominees, such nomination shall be disregarded and such business
shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote
may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 3.4,
to be considered a qualified representative of the Stockholder, a person must
be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such Stockholder or must
be authorized by a writing executed by such Stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such Stockholder to act for such Stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of Stockholders and such person must produce such writing
or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or
electronic transmission, at the meeting of Stockholders.

(J) Nothing in this Section 3.4 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the
holders of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation pursuant to any
applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or any rights of a
stockholder in any agreement with the Corporation. 

3.5 _Resignation_. Any Director may resign at any time by notice given in
writing or by electronic transmission to the Secretary. Such resignation
shall take effect at the date of receipt of such notice or at such later time
as is therein specified.

3.6 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without
notice at such times and at such places as may be determined from time to time
by the Board or its Chairman.

 

3.7 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board may be held at such
times and at such places as may be determined by the Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer or the President on at least 24 hours notice to each
Director given by one of the means specified in Section 3.10 hereof other than
by mail or on at least three days notice if given by mail. Special meetings
shall be called by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or
the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of any
two or more Directors.

 

3.8 _Telephone Meetings_. Board or Board committee meetings may be held by
means of telephone conference or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Participation by a Director in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 

3.9 _Adjourned Meetings_. A majority of the Directors present at any meeting
of the Board, including an adjourned meeting, whether or not a quorum is
present, may adjourn and reconvene such meeting to another time and place. At
least 24 hours notice of any adjourned meeting of the Board shall be given to
each Director whether or not present at the time of the adjournment, if such
notice shall be given by one of the means specified in Section 3.9 hereof
other than by mail, or at least three days notice if by mail. Any business
may be transacted at an adjourned meeting that might have been transacted at
the meeting as originally called.

3.10 _Notice Procedure_. Subject to Sections 3.7 and 3.11 hereof, whenever
notice is required to be given to any Director by applicable Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, such notice shall be deemed
given effectively if given in person or by telephone, mail addressed to such
Director at such Directors address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation, telegram, telecopy or by other means of electronic transmission.

 

3.11 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever the giving of any notice to Directors is
required by applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
laws, a waiver thereof, given by the Director entitled to the notice, whether
before or after such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance by a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of  such meeting except when the Director attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special Board or committee meeting need be specified in any waiver
of notice.

 

3.12 _Organization_. At each meeting of the Board, the Chairman or, in his or
her absence, another Director selected by the Board shall preside. The
Secretary shall act as secretary at each meeting of the Board. If the
Secretary is absent from any meeting of the Board, an Assistant Secretary
shall perform the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from
any such meeting of the Secretary and all Assistant Secretaries, the person
presiding at the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

 

3.13 _Quorum of Directors_. The presence of a majority of the Board shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at any meeting of the Board.

3.14 _Action by Majority Vote_. Except as otherwise expressly required by
these By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote of a majority of
the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the
act of the Board.

 

3.15 _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by these By-laws,
any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all Directors or
members of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission, and the writings or electronic transmissions are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD_

 

The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting
of such committee. If a member of a committee shall be absent from any
meeting, or disqualified from voting thereat, the remaining member or members
present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such
member or members constitute a quorum, may, by a unanimous vote, appoint

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES_

 

6.1 _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_ ") who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees)
reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or
part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of
such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the
Board.

 

6.2 _Advancement of Expenses_. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by a Covered Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition
of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the
Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately
determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article VI or otherwise.

6.3 _Claims_.

 

(A) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, if a claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not
paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Covered
Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit
to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. To
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, in any such action the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not
entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable Law.

(B) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a Covered Person seeking
to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a
defense that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable Law.
With respect to any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a
right to indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
(whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i)
the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to
commencement of such suit that indemnification of such Covered Person
is proper in the circumstances because such Covered Person has met the
applicable standards of conduct under applicable law, nor (ii) an actual
determination by the Corporation that such Covered Person has not met such
applicable standards of conduct, shall create a presumption that such Covered
Person has not met the applicable standards of conduct or, in a case brought
by such Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification, be a
defense to such suit.

 

(C) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the
Corporation to prove that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the Covered Person from
whom the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this
Article VI or otherwise.

 

6.4 _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by
this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such Covered
Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of these By-
laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of Stockholders or
disinterested Directors or otherwise.  6.5 _Other Sources_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or to
advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise
shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person actually collects as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other entity or
enterprise; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Covered Person shall be required
to seek recovery from any other entity or enterprise.

 

6.6 _Amendment or Repeal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any repeal or amendment of this Article VI by changes in Law (or
otherwise), or the adoption of any other provision of these By-laws
inconsistent with this Article VI, will, unless otherwise required by Law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in Law
permits the Corporation to provide broader rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect
any right or protection of a Covered Person existing at the time of such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of
any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision, regardless of when the applicable action, suit
or proceeding in respect of which such right or protection is sought is
commenced and regardless of when such right or protection is sought.

 

6.7 _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_. This Article VI shall
not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by applicable Law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons
other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate
action.

 

6.8 _Exclusive Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (B) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or
the Corporations stockholders, (C) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-law (in each case, as
the same may be amended from time to time) or any other law applicable to the
Corporation, or (D) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal
affairs doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. If
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action proceeding
shall be another court of the State of Delaware or, if no court of the State
of Delaware has jurisdiction, then the federal district court for the
District of Delaware. Any person who, or entity that, holds, purchases or
otherwise acquires an interest in stock of the Corporation (including any
"beneficial owner", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
shall be deemed (A) to have notice of, and to have consented to and agreed to
comply with, the provisions of this By-law, and (B) to have consented to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if
the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another court of the State
of Delaware, or if no court of the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the
federal district court for the District of Delaware) in any proceeding
brought to enjoin any action by that person or entity that is inconsistent
with the exclusive jurisdiction provided for in this By-law. If any action
subject matter of which is within the scope of this By-law is filed in a court
other than as specified above in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder
shall be deemed to have consented to (A) the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, another court in the State of
Delaware or the federal district court in the District of Delaware, as
appropriate, in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce this By-law and (B) having service of process made upon such
stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholders counsel in
the action as agent for such stockholder.

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. If required by applicable law, an annual
meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such
date, time and place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware,
as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to
time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
The Corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of
stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, but
such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.
Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to
the purposes stated in the notice. The Corporation may postpone, reschedule
or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the
Board of Directors.

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be
given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
(if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law,
the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the notice of any meeting
shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before
the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as
of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

 



-2- Section 1.4. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place,
and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and
place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which
might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given
to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the
record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders
the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall
be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a
quorum, the stockholders so present may, by a majority in voting power
thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in
Section 1.4 of these bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own
stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of
the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither
be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its
own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice
Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President,

foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board of Directors, or
in the absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The
Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the
chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled
to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each
share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter
in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if
it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the
Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. At all
meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is
present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other
elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall, unless a different or minimum vote is required by the
certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, the rules or regulations of any
stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law or regulation
applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such different
or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter, be decided by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares
of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote thereon.

 



-3- Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also
be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior
to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days
after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders
entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
is fixed by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of
Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the
first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with
applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on
the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action.

 



-4- Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Corporation shall
prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided,
however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote
is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall
reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the
meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for
any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting
(i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a
list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and
kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and
may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be
held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the
meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of
stockholders required by this Section 1.9 or to vote in person or by proxy at
any meeting of stockholders.

Section 1.10. _Action By Written Consent of Stockholders_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or
agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of
proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent
required by law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

 

Section 1.11. _Inspectors of Election_. The Corporation may, and shall if
required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act
at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report
thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event
that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before

 



-5-  entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an
oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality
and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors
so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
(ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at
the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and
ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors count of
all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted
by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election
may serve as an inspector at such election.

Section 1.12.  _Conduct of Meetings_. The date and time of the opening and
the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote
at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over
the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem
appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations
as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting
of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or
no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of
such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.
Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of
Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include,
without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or
order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining
order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on
attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such
other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv)
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the
commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or
comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders,
in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the
conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to
the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the
meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such
presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or
business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or
considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or
the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be
required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

any two authorized officers of the Corporation (it being understood that each
of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Vice Chairperson of the
Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any
Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary shall be an
authorized officer for such purpose), certifying the number of shares owned by

any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

 



-11- ARTICLE VI

 

 _Indemnification_

 

Section 6.1. _Right to Indemnification._ The Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it
presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_
") who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees)
reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or
part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of
such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the
Board.

 

Section 6.2. _Advancement of Expenses_. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of
its final disposition, _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required
by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final
disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should
be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.

Section 6.3. _Claims_.

 

(a) To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, if a claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not
paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Covered
Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit
to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. To
the extent not prohibited by applicable law, in any such action the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not
entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable law.

(b) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a Covered Person seeking
to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a
defense that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable law.
With respect to any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a
right to indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
(whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i)
the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to
commencement of such suit that indemnification of such Covered Person
is proper in the circumstances because such Covered Person has met the
applicable standards of conduct under

 



-12-  applicable law, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Corporation that
such Covered Person has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall
create a presumption that such Covered Person has not met the applicable
standards of conduct or, in a case brought by such Covered Person seeking to
enforce a right to indemnification, be a defense to such suit.

 

(c) In any suit brought by a Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the
Corporation to prove that the Covered Person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the Covered Person from
whom the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this
Article VI or otherwise.

 

Section 6.4. _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any Covered
Person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights that
such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision
of these bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

Section 6.5. _Other Sources_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving
at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity or
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person actually
collects as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other
entity or enterprise; provided, however, that no Covered Person shall be
required to seek recovery from any other entity or enterprise.

 

Section 6.6. _Amendment or Repeal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any repeal or amendment of this Article VI by changes in
law (or otherwise), or the adoption of any other provision of these bylaws
inconsistent with this Article VI, will, unless otherwise required by law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
law permits the Corporation to provide broader rights on a retroactive basis
than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection of a Covered Person existing at the time of
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or
adoption of such inconsistent provision, regardless of when the applicable
action, suit or proceeding in respect of which such right or protection is
sought is commenced and regardless of when such right or protection is sought.

Section 6.7. _Other Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. This
Article VI shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in
the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to advance expenses
to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate
corporate action.

 



-13- ARTICLE VII

inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to

or permitted by applicable law, notices to directors and stockholders shall
be in writing and delivered personally or mailed to the directors or
stockholders at their addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation.
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, and except as prohibited by applicable law, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of
applicable law, the certificate of incorporation, or these bylaws shall be
effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an
address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in
writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice
by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice permitted under
this Section 7.3, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single
written notice. Notice to directors may be given by telecopier, telephone or
other means of electronic transmission.

 

Section 7.4. _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Any waiver of notice, given by the person entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in a waiver of notice.

Section 7.5. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in
the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of
account, and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form
of, any information storage device or method, provided that the records so
kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable
time.

Section 7.6.  _Amendment of Bylaws_. These bylaws may be altered, amended or
repealed, and new bylaws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders
may make additional bylaws and may alter and repeal any bylaws whether adopted
by them or otherwise.

Registration Statement is initially effective, as promptly as is practicable
after receipt of a request that complies with the notice provisions in
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, and in any event within (x)
ten (10) Business Days after the date such request is received by the Company

Business Days after the expiration of such Suspension Period, the Company

material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus not misleading and (y) the Company shall
not be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any
related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference if the
Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
counsel, that such amendment would reasonably be expected to have a material

similar transaction, in each case that is material to the Company (in case of
each clause (x) and (y), a " _Suspension Period_ "); _provided_ that (A) the

Trade the managing underwriter or underwriters shall be selected by the
Electing Shareholder who made the initial request and shall be reasonably

Underwritten Offering advise the Company that in their reasonable opinion the
number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering
takedown exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such
offering within a price range acceptable to the Electing Shareholders, the
Company shall include in such Shareholder Underwritten Offering the number
which can be so sold in the following order of priority: (A) first, the
securities requested to be included by the Electing Shareholders (pro rata
among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities
then-owned by each such holder), (B) second, the securities requested to be

applicable Registration Statement;

 

(viii) provide Counsel to the Shareholders a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon any Registration Statement and any Prospectus supplements;

(ix) in the event of the issuance or threatened issuance of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order
suspending or preventing the use of any related Prospectus or suspending the
qualification of any Registrable Securities included in such Registration
Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use its commercially
reasonable efforts promptly to (A) prevent the issuance of any such stop
order, and in the event of such issuance, to obtain the withdrawal of such
order and (B) obtain, at the earliest practicable date, the withdrawal of any
order suspending or preventing the use of any related Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus or suspending qualification of any Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction;

 

(x) if requested by any participating Electing Shareholder promptly include in
a Prospectus supplement or amendment such information as the Shareholder may
reasonably request, including in order to permit the intended method of
distribution of such securities, and make all required filings of such

after the Company has received such request;

 



12 (xi) in the case of certificated Registrable Securities, cooperate with the
participating Shareholders of Registrable Securities and the managing
underwriters to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates
(not bearing any legends) representing Registrable Securities sold pursuant to
a Shelf Registration Statement; 

(xii) cause the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities, as may be reasonably necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the seller or sellers of Registrable
Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 

(xiii) in the case of a Shareholder Underwritten Offering, enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and perform its obligations thereunder and take such other
commercially reasonable actions as are required in order to expedite or

customary legal opinions in connection with any such underwriting agreements;

(xiv) provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities not later than the

(xv) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any seller of
Registrable Securities, any managing underwriter participating in any
disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement, Counsel to the Shareholders and any attorney, accountant or other
agent retained by the selling Shareholder managing underwriters
(collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "), all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be reasonably
necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and
cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, directors and employees,
and the independent public accountants of the Company, to supply
all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection with
such Registration Statement. Records that the Company determines, in good
faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors are
confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors (and the Inspectors
shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the Company if the
Company shall so request) unless (A) the disclosure of such Records is
necessary, in the Inspectors judgment and with the concurrence of counsel to
the Company, to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the
Registration Statement, (B) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to
a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction after
exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (C) the information in such Records was
known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by
the Company or has been made generally available to the public. Each seller
of Registrable Securities agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure
of such Records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction or by any other
person, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at the Companys
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records
deemed confidential;

 

(xvi) in the case of a Shareholder Underwritten Offering, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a "comfort" letter or letters, dated as of such
date or dates as the Counsel to the Shareholders or the managing underwriters
reasonably requests, from the Companys independent public accountants in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
"comfort" letters as Counsel to the Shareholders or any managing underwriter
reasonably requests;

 



13 (xvii) in the case of a Shareholder Underwritten Offering, furnish, at the
request of any managing underwriter for such offering an opinion with respect
to legal matters and a negative assurance letter with respect to disclosure
matters, dated as of each closing date of such offering of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to
the underwriters, covering such matters with respect to the registration in
respect of which such opinion and letter are being delivered as the
underwriters, may reasonably request and are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters;

(xviii) in the case of a Shareholder Underwritten Offering, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist in any filings
required to be made with FINRA and in the performance of any due diligence
investigation by any underwriter and its counsel (including any "qualified
independent underwriter," if applicable) that is (A) required or requested by
FINRA in order to obtain written confirmation from FINRA that FINRA does not
object to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and
arrangements (or any deemed underwriting terms and arrangements) relating to
the resale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement, including, without limitation, information provided to FINRA
through its COBRADesk system or (B) required to be retained in
accordance with the rules and regulations of FINRA;

(xix) if requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or by any Shareholder
of Registrable Securities being sold in a Shareholder Underwritten Offering,
promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to
the Shelf Registration Statement such information as the managing
underwriters, if any, or such Shareholders indicate relates to them or that
they reasonably request be included therein, including information relating to
the "Plan of Distribution" of the Registrable Securities;

 

(xx) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filings of all Prospectuses and
Free Writing Prospectuses with the SEC; and

(xxi) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filing fee payments in respect of
any Registration Statement or Prospectus used under this Agreement (and any
offering covered thereby).

 

(c) _Seller Requirements_. In connection with any offering under any
Registration Statement under this Agreement, each Electing Shareholder (i)
shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing notice of the intended method
of disposition of its Registrable Securities, the amount of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold and such other information with respect
to such Shareholder as the Company may reasonably request or as may be
required by law or regulations for use in connection with any related
Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) and
all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information
previously furnished to the Company by such Shareholder not contain a material
misstatement of fact or necessary to cause such Registration Statement or
Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) not to omit a material fact
with respect to such Shareholder necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading; (ii) shall comply with the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and all applicable state securities laws and comply with all
applicable regulations in connection with the registration and the disposition
of the Registrable Securities; and (iii) shall not use any Free Writing
Prospectus without the prior written consent of the Company. If any Electing
Shareholder of Registrable Securities fails to provide such information

 



14  required to be included in such Registration Statement by applicable
securities laws or otherwise necessary in connection with the disposition of
such Registrable Securities in a timely manner after written request
therefor, the Company may exclude such Electing Shareholders Registrable
Securities from a registration under _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or _Section_ __ _
2.3_ hereof.

 

Each Person that has securities registered for resale on a Registration
Statement filed hereunder agrees that, prior to each disposition of
securities pursuant to a Registration Statement filed hereunder, it shall
give the Company two (2) Business Days notice of its intention to make such
disposition and that upon receipt of any notice contemplated in  _Section_ __
_ 2.2(c)_, such Person will forthwith discontinue the disposition of its
Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement.

 

Section 2.6. _Registration Expenses_. All Registration Expenses shall be borne
by the Company; _provided_ that the Company shall not bear more than 50% of
any costs or expenses associated with any "road shows" or related travel. All
Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered shall be borne
by the Shareholders of such Registrable Securities pro rata on the basis of
the number of Registrable Securities sold.

Section 2.7. _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 

(a) _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Shareholder, its partners, members, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, trustees and each Person who controls such
Shareholder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, or any
action or proceeding in respect thereof (including any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, whether or not the indemnified
party is a party to any proceeding) (each, a " _Liability_ " and collectively,
" _Liabilities_ "), arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue, or allegedly
untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any Disclosure Package, any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement
thereto, and (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Disclosure
Package, any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or in any amendment or
supplement thereto any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading under the
circumstances in which such statements were made; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be held liable in any such case to the extent that
any such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such
Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, or such amendment or
supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information
concerning such Shareholder furnished in writing to the Company by or on
behalf of such Shareholder expressly for inclusion therein, including,
without limitation, the information furnished to the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_ hereof. The Company shall
also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the Registrable
Securities, their officers, directors and employees and each Person who
controls such underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act) at least to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Shareholders of Registrable Securities.

(b) _Indemnification by Shareholders_. In connection with any offering in
which a Shareholder is participating pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof, such Shareholder agrees severally (and not
jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each other
Shareholder and their respective partners, members, shareholders, directors,
officers, managers, employees, agents, trustees, the other Shareholders, any
underwriter retained by the Company and each Person who controls the Company,
the

 



15  other Shareholders or such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Company to the Shareholders (including indemnification of their respective
partners, directors, officers, Affiliates, stockholders, members, employees,
trustees and controlling Persons), but only to the extent that Liabilities
arise out of or are based upon a statement or alleged statement or an
omission or alleged omission that was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information with respect to such Shareholder furnished in writing to the
Company by or on behalf of such Shareholder expressly for use in
such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, or such
amendment or supplement thereto, including, without limitation, the
information furnished to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate
amount to be indemnified by any Shareholder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_ and contributed by any Shareholder pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.7(d)_ shall be limited to the net proceeds (after deducting underwriters
discounts and commissions) received by such Shareholder in the offering to
which such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus or such
amendment or supplement thereto relates.

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled
to indemnification or contribution hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any
written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the Indemnified
Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits
substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of
commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as above
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to
the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly
notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with
counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party.
Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by
the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay such
fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or
(iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties
have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party.
In any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party,
it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for the reasonably incurred and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel)
for all Indemnified Parties and all such reasonably incurred and documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such Indemnified Party,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of
which such Indemnified Party is or may be a party and indemnity has been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability for
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

 



16 (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this  _Section_ __
_ 2.7_ from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of
any Liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in
such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_, any documented out-of-
pocket legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such
party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; _provided_ , that
the aggregate amount to be contributed by any Shareholder pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ and indemnified by such Shareholder pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ shall be limited to the net proceeds (after deducting
the underwriters discounts and commissions) received by such Shareholder in
the offering.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

The parties hereto agree that this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.8. _Participation in Underwritten Offering/Sale of Registrable
Securities_. No Person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder
unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements in customary form entered into
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) completes and executes
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements
and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements; _provided_ , that the Shareholders included in any underwritten
registration shall make only those representations and warranties to the
Company or the underwriters as are customary for similar transactions and such
other representations and warranties that the underwriters may reasonably
request that are agreed by any such Shareholder.

Section 2.9. _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the Shareholders
of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144 the Company covenants that
for so long as the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file all
reports and other documents required, if any, to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted
thereunder, (ii) make available information necessary to comply with Rule 144
at all times, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such
Shareholder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144
and (iii) deliver, upon the reasonable request of any Shareholder
of Registrable Securities, a written certification to such Shareholder as to
whether the Company has complied with the information requirements of Rule
144. If at any time the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act, it will make available other information as required by,
and so long as necessary to permit sales of Registrable Securities pursuant
to, Rule 144.

 



17 Section 2.10. _Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Shareholders beneficially owning not less than a majority of the then-
outstanding Registrable Securities, enter into any agreement with any holder
or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would allow such
holder or prospective holder to include such securities in the Shelf
Registration Statement unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder
or prospective holder may include such securities in any such Shelf
Registration Statement only to the extent that the inclusion of its securities
will not reduce the amount of Registrable Securities of the Shareholders that
are included on such Shelf Registration Statement.

 

Section 2.11. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Stock Splits, etc._ The provisions of this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse
splits, combinations recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date
hereof.

(b) _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not enter into any
agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights
granted to the Shareholders in this Agreement and shall take all commercially
reasonable efforts to amend any agreements existing as of the date hereof
so that such agreements shall not be inconsistent with the rights granted to
the Shareholders in this Agreement.

(c) _No "Group"_. It is the intention of the Parties that each Shareholder or
its Subsidiaries shall not be considered by virtue of this Agreement to be
part of a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act involving any other Shareholder or its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.2.  _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by any other
Party. It is accordingly agreed that each of the Parties will be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches and/or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case without the necessity of providing any bond or other
security, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware
state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

Section 3.3. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Each Shareholder party hereto agrees and acknowledges,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that the Registration Rights
Agreement, dated May 12, 2011, and any amendments, supplements or
acknowledgments thereto, are hereby terminated with respect to
such Shareholder and its Affiliates and such Shareholder and its Affiliates
only have the registration rights set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement
will be binding upon, except as provided in _Article II_ , and inure solely to
the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns. Except as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any Person that is not
a Party any rights, benefits or remedies hereunder.

Section 3.4. _Amendments; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by
the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective (provided that the
approval or consent of a Shareholder that does not then own Registrable
Securities shall not be required with respect to any amendment or waiver).

Section 3.5. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned, in whole or in
part, by (i) either Fortress or Leucadia without the prior written consent of
the Company or (ii) by the Company without the prior written consent of each
of Fortress and Leucadia; _provided_ , that, without the consent of any other
Party, the rights set forth in _Article II_ shall be assignable by the
Shareholders to (a) any transferee of such Shareholders Registrable
Securities if such transferee is the recipient of at least five percent (5%)
of the Companys then outstanding Common Stock from the Shareholder in a
private placement transaction or (b) any Permitted Transferee, in the case of
each of clause (a) and (b), who becomes a party to this Agreement by executing
a joinder hereto in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence will be void. Subject
to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



20 Section 3.6. _Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of

Agreement, to the extent any provision herein conflicts, in the Companys
reasonable discretion, with Article 13 of the Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation shall control.

Section 3.7. _Determination of Ownership_. From time to time, at the request
of the Company, each Shareholder will confirm in writing that it continues to
Beneficially Own Registrable Securities. The rights of a Shareholder under
this Agreement shall terminate when such Shareholder no longer owns
Registrable Securities and this Agreement shall terminate when no Shareholder
owns Registrable Securities.

Section 3.8.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related thereto, the relationship of the Parties,
and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the
Parties, whether arising at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise,
will be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules regarding conflicts
of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction
would be required thereby.

Section 3.9. _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for the
purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

(a) The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation hereof.

 

(b) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an article or a section,
paragraph, such reference will be to an article or a section, paragraph

or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation."

 

(d) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import
will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

 

(e) The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply
"if."

(f) The meaning assigned to each term defined herein will be equally

denoting any gender will include all genders. Where a word or phrase is
defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms will have a corresponding

number of calendar days, unless otherwise specified.

(i) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring
or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions
hereof.

(j) Any statute or rule defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such statute or rule as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of
comparable successor statutes or rules and references to all attachments

21 Section 3.10. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties agrees that any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and obligations
arising hereunder brought by any other Party or its successors or assigns,
will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action
or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

Section 3.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF
THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 3.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full
force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without
materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the Parties. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 3.13. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 3.14.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which when executed will be deemed to be an original,
and all of which together will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. For purposes of this
Agreement, facsimile signatures or signatures by other electronic form of
transfer will be deemed originals, and the Parties agree to exchange original
signatures as promptly as possible.
