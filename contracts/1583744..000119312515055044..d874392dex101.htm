the amount of equity set forth therein (collectively, the &#147;<B><U>Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment</U></B>&#148;), which amount shall be used by Buyer to consummate the Transaction. Sponsor hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions

and may structure the funding of such amounts into Buyer through one or more intermediate entities; however, no such action will reduce the amount of the Commitment or otherwise affect the
obligations of Sponsor under this letter agreement. In the event Buyer does not require all of the equity with respect to which Sponsor has made this Commitment in order to consummate the Transaction, the amount to be funded under this letter
agreement may be reduced as determined by Sponsor; provided that such reduction does not and will not, directly or indirectly, cause or result in the failure of any condition to the Debt Financing, and no such reduction shall (i)&nbsp;relieve the
Sponsor of its obligations under this letter agreement or any Co-Sponsor under such Co-Sponsor&#146;s Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment Letter or (ii)&nbsp;prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transaction. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. <U>Conditions</U></B>. The obligation of Sponsor to fund or cause the funding of the Commitment shall be subject only to (i)&nbsp;the

their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to their satisfaction at the Closing, or those conditions that are not satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement), (ii)&nbsp;the Debt Financing (including any
Substitute Financing) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded on the date Closing is required to occur pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if the Equity Financing is funded at such date and (iii)&nbsp;the concurrent
consummation of the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. <B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3. <U>Enforceability</U></B>. Subject to

and indirect creditors other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller as a creditor of Buyer), other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of this letter
agreement, or any rights to enforce the Commitment or to cause Buyer to enforce the Commitment. Subject to all terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, including Section&nbsp;11.3 of the Purchase Agreement, Seller is hereby made a third party
beneficiary of the rights granted hereby only for the purpose of seeking specific performance of Buyer&#146;s right to cause the Commitment to be funded (solely to the extent that Buyer can enforce the Commitment in accordance with the terms
hereof). Any exercise of such third party beneficiary rights are subject to Seller&#146;s prior delivery of written notice to Buyer and Sponsor stating Seller&#146;s unqualified acceptance of, and agreement to comply with, the provisions and

induce the Seller to enter into the Purchase Agreement. The Sponsor hereby waives any defense to specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate or that, absent specific performance, no irreparable harm would be suffered and any
requirement under applicable law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>4. <U>No
