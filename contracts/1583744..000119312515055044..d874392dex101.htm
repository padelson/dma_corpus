Arc Terminals Joliet Holdings LLC

c/o Arc Logistics Partners LP

725 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor

New York, NY 10022

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This letter agreement sets forth the commitment of Arc Logistics Partners LP
(" _Sponsor_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions described below,
to purchase, or cause the purchase of, the equity of Arc Terminals Joliet
Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ ") in connection
with the transaction contemplated by that certain Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Purchase
Agreement_ ") and entered into concurrently herewith by and among Buyer and
CenterPoint Properties Trust (" _Seller_ "), pursuant to which Buyer has
agreed, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, to
purchase from Seller all of Sellers right, title and interest in all of the
issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Joliet Bulk,
Barge and Rail LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "; and
such acquisition, the " _Transaction_ "). Each capitalized term used but not
defined in this letter agreement will have the meaning ascribed to it in the
Purchase Agreement, except as otherwise provided below.

 

1\. _Commitment_. In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement,
Buyer has received separate equity commitment letters, each dated the date
hereof (each, a " _Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment Letter_ "), from each of the
persons listed on Schedule A, other than the undersigned Sponsor (such
persons, collectively, the " _Co-Sponsors_ "), wherein each Co-Sponsor has
agreed that at Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in its
respective Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment Letter, it will contribute or cause to
be contributed to Buyer the amount of equity set forth therein (collectively,
the " _Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment_ "), which amount shall be used by Buyer
to consummate the Transaction. Sponsor hereby agrees, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this letter agreement, to purchase (or cause
the purchase of) at the Closing equity securities of Buyer (the " _Buyer
Securities_ ") for an aggregate cash purchase price (in cash in immediately
available funds) of not less than the amount set forth next to the Sponsors
name on Schedule A (the " _Commitment_ "), for the purpose of providing a
portion of the cash required to fund a portion of, and together with the Co-
Sponsor Equity Commitments, providing all of the cash required to fund, the
Purchase Price and to pay the related expenses of Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate
liability of Sponsor hereunder exceed the amount of the Commitment. Sponsor
may effect the purchase of the Buyer Securities directly or indirectly through
one or more affiliated entities or other co-investors designated by it  and may structure the funding of such amounts into Buyer through one or more
intermediate entities; however, no such action will reduce the amount of the
Commitment or otherwise affect the obligations of Sponsor under this letter
agreement. In the event Buyer does not require all of the equity with respect
to which Sponsor has made this Commitment in order to consummate the
Transaction, the amount to be funded under this letter agreement may be
reduced as determined by Sponsor; provided that such reduction does not and
will not, directly or indirectly, cause or result in the failure of any
condition to the Debt Financing, and no such reduction shall (i) relieve
the Sponsor of its obligations under this letter agreement or any Co-Sponsor
under such Co-Sponsors Co-Sponsor Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transaction.

 

2\. _Conditions_. The obligation of Sponsor to fund or cause the funding of
the Commitment shall be subject only to (i) the satisfaction, or, to the
extent legally permissible, waiver by Buyer, of each of the conditions to
Buyers obligations to consummate the Transaction set forth in Section 8.1 of
the Purchase Agreement (other than those conditions that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to their satisfaction at the
Closing, or those conditions that are not satisfied in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase Agreement), (ii) the Debt Financing (including
any Substitute Financing) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded on the date Closing is required to occur pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement if the Equity Financing is funded at such date and
(iii) the concurrent consummation of the Closing in accordance with the terms
of the Purchase Agreement.

3\. _Enforceability_. Subject to the immediately following sentence, this
letter agreement may only be enforced by Buyer, and nothing set forth in this
letter shall be construed to confer upon or give to Seller or any other Person
(including Buyers and Sellers direct and indirect creditors other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, Seller as a creditor of Buyer), other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any benefits,
rights or remedies under or by reason of this letter agreement, or any rights
to enforce the Commitment or to cause Buyer to enforce the Commitment. Subject
to all terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, including Section 11.3
of the Purchase Agreement, Seller is hereby made a third party beneficiary of
the rights granted hereby only for the purpose of seeking specific performance
of Buyers right to cause the Commitment to be funded (solely to the extent
that Buyer can enforce the Commitment in accordance with the terms hereof).
Any exercise of such third party beneficiary rights are subject to Sellers
prior delivery of written notice to Buyer and Sponsor stating Sellers
unqualified acceptance of, and agreement to comply with, the provisions
and limitations of this letter agreement. The exercise by Buyer or Seller of
any right to enforce this letter agreement does not give rise to any other
remedies, monetary or otherwise. This letter agreement is being entered into
by Buyer and Sponsor to induce the Seller to enter into the Purchase
Agreement. The Sponsor hereby waives any defense to specific performance that
a remedy at law would be adequate or that, absent specific performance, no
irreparable harm would be suffered and any requirement under applicable law
to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

4\. _No Modification; Entire Agreement_. This letter agreement may not be
amended or otherwise modified without the prior written consent of Buyer,
Sponsor and Seller. A written release or waiver by a party hereto of any
rights hereunder shall be deemed an amendment or modification hereof. This
letter agreement constitutes the sole agreement, and

 



2  supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and statements, written or
oral, between Sponsor or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, on the other, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5\. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of such state or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of New York.

 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
THE COURTS OF NEW YORK STATE OR THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN
NEW YORK COUNTY, STATE OF NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IN THE COURTS OF NEW YORK STATE OR THE UNITED
STATES FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY, STATE OF NEW YORK AND
WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT SUCH SUIT OR PROCEEDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
SHALL BE DETERMINED SOLELY BY A FINAL AND UNAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING (OR A SETTLEMENT TANTAMOUNT THERETO), AND ANY SUCH FINAL AND
UNAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OR IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PROVIDED IN LAW OR IN EQUITY.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS LETTER AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION
ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
LETTER AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 5.

 



3 6\. _Counterparts_. This letter agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic transmission in
"portable document format"), and all such counterparts shall together
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

7\. _Confidentiality_. This letter agreement shall be treated as confidential
and is being provided to Buyer solely in connection with the Purchase
Agreement and may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to in
any document (other than the Purchase Agreement and the Co-Sponsor Equity
Commitment Letters), except with the prior written consent of the Sponsor;
provided, however, that (a) this letter agreement shall be provided to Seller
(so long as Seller agrees to keep, and agrees to cause its respective
Affiliates and Representatives to keep, this letter agreement confidential
on terms that are substantially identical to the terms contained in this
sentence) and (b) Seller may disclose this letter agreement (i) to its
respective Affiliates and Representatives, (ii) to the extent required by law
or the applicable rules of any national securities exchange (including,
without limitation, a summary description thereof in the documents filed or

in connection with any litigation relating to this letter agreement, the
Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

8.  _Termination_. The obligation of Sponsor to fund the Commitment will
terminate automatically and immediately upon the earliest to occur of (a) the
consummation of the Transaction, (b) the valid termination of the
Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms, (c) the date that is five
(5) Business Days after the Outside Date, provided that, in the event any
claim seeking an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy
against Buyer under Purchase Agreement is then pending, this letter agreement
shall not terminate under this clause (c) until any such claim has been
resolved in a final non-appealable decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction, and (d) Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
acting on their behalf assert in any litigation or other legal proceeding or
arbitration any claim against Sponsor, any Non-Recourse Party or their
respective Affiliates in connection with the Purchase Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than any claim relating to
any breach, or seeking to prevent any breach, of the Confidentiality Agreement
or any claim by Seller seeking specific performance against (i) Buyer under
the Purchase Agreement or (ii) Sponsor under this letter agreement as
contemplated by Section 3 hereof); provided that no claim described in clause
(ii) may seek to cause Sponsor to contribute more than the Commitment, and
if Seller or any of its Affiliates asserts any such claim, this letter
agreement shall terminate in accordance with this Section 8\. Upon valid
termination of this letter agreement, the Sponsor shall not have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder.

9\. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this letter agreement, or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits of this letter
agreement, Buyer covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than
Sponsor has any liability, obligation or commitment of any nature, known or
unknown, whether due or to become due, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
hereunder and that, notwithstanding that Sponsor or any of its successors or
permitted assigns may be limited partnerships, Buyer has no right of

their creation, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
oral representations made or

 



4  alleged to be made in connection herewith, against, and no personal

legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law, or otherwise, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that
no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise
be incurred by any Non-Recourse Party, as such, for any obligations of Sponsor
or any of its successors or permitted assignees under this letter agreement or
any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligation or their
creation.

portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion
thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such
provision to any other Persons or circumstances. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto intend that the remedies and limitations
thereon contained in this letter agreement, including Section 9, be construed
as an integral provision of this letter agreement and that such remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases liability or
obligations hereunder of any party hereto or of any Non-Recourse Party.
