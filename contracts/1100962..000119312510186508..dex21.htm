\- vi - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August
9, 2010, is by and among Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), West Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
an indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co., a Washington corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, Parent
proposes to cause Merger Sub to commence an offer (as it may be amended from
time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share of Company
Common Stock of $5.00, net to the seller in cash, without interest (such
consideration or any other consideration paid per share pursuant to the Offer,
the " _Offer Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "
_WBCA_ ") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to
which each share of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company and (ii) Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ "), are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company, (ii) adopted
and approved this Agreement and the Transactions and declared it advisable
that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions,
(iii) resolved to recommend that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer
and approve the Merger and the Plan of Merger and (iv) taken all actions so
that the restrictions contained in the Articles of Incorporation and the WBCA
applicable to a "significant business transaction" (as defined in Chapter
23B.19 of the WBCA) will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement or the Shareholder Tender Agreements (as defined below), or
to the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Continuing Directors of the Company (as such term is defined in
the Companys Articles of Incorporation), voting separately as a subclass of
the Company Board, have unanimously adopted and approved this Agreement and
the Merger pursuant to Section 13.2.2 of the Companys Articles of
Incorporation, including the Merger; WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has adopted, approved and
declared it advisable for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, and Parent, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, has adopted and approved the Merger and the Plan of Merger upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have entered into a Shareholder Tender Agreement in the
form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto with each of Tang Capital Partners L.P.,
Kevin C. Tang, Perceptive Advisors LLC and Jennifer Good (collectively, the "
_Shareholder Tender Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
each of them has irrevocably agreed to tender shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them in the Offer (the shares subject to such agreements
constituting, in the aggregate, approximately 38.6% of the fully diluted
Company Common Stock on the date hereof); and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company will enter into the Sixth Amendment to the Amended and
Restated Strategic Alliance Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit D_
hereto, effective in accordance with its terms;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including
ARTICLE VIII), as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than August
20, 2010), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence,
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
" _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer; _provided_ , that the Company agrees that no
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company will be tendered pursuant
to the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer Conditions_ ").

 

(i) The initial Expiration Date (defined in _Exhibit A_ ) shall be 12:00
midnight, New York City time, at the end of the 20th Business Day
following commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rules 14d-1(g)(3)
and 14d-2 under



 

\- 2 -  the Exchange Act). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time, to,
in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or
modify the terms of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the
Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C)
change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit
A_ ), (D) impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) extend the Offer except as provided in
this Section 1.1 for a period of five (5) Business Days on each such occasion
or (F) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of
Company Common Stock or that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub
(A) may, in its sole discretion (subject to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under Section 1.1(a)(ii)(B) and Section 1.1(a)(iii)), without
consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for a period
of five (5) Business Days on each such occasion if, on any then-scheduled
Expiration Date (defined in _Exhibit A_ ), any of the Offer Conditions shall
not be satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived (if permitted
under this Agreement) until such time as such condition or conditions are
satisfied or waived and (B) shall extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof or the
Nasdaq Stock Market (the " _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer, and until any
waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of
the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and any other applicable foreign antitrust,
competition or similar Law shall have expired or been terminated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer
(1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any time that Parent or Merger Sub is
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII.

 

(iii) In addition to the extension obligation set forth in Section
1.1(a)(ii)(B), Parent and Merger Sub agree that if on any scheduled
Expiration Date of the Offer, the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied
but all of the other Offer Conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ are satisfied
or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, then Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, on each of the first two such scheduled
expiration dates, extend the Offer for periods of five (5) Business Days on
each such occasion; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not
require Merger Sub to extend the expiration of the Offer more than two times,
for five (5) Business Days on each such occasion, and in no event shall Merger
Sub be required to extend the Offer (1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any
time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII.

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as



 

\- 3 -  practicable after the Expiration Date (defined in _Exhibit A_ ) (as it may
be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a)). The Offer
Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.
Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Closing Date_." Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole
discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a "subsequent
offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , such period (including any extensions thereof) shall
not exceed twenty (20) Business Days. The Offer Documents (as defined below)
may, in Merger Subs sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of
right.

(v) Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(a) shall affect any termination
rights in ARTICLE VIII. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the
Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole discretion. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) following such termination irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated in
accordance with this Agreement prior to the purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, or cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to promptly return, all
tendered shares to the tendering shareholders.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other appropriate ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company as and to the extent required by United States federal securities
Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent
or Parents legal counsel in writing upon request all information concerning
the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any action contemplated by
this Section 1.1(b). Parent shall cause the Schedule TO and other Offer
Documents to comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to the
extent required by applicable

 



 

\- 4 -  United States federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence and
summaries of all material oral communications between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to
the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any such comments. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub
receives any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents, each shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly
to such comments and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the
issues raised therein.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall make all appropriate arrangements with
the Paying Agent so that:

(i) holders of Company Options (whether or not such Company Options shall
otherwise be exercisable) may tender shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Company Options pursuant to the Offer by delivering to
the Paying Agent prior to the Offer Closing such documents as may be required
pursuant to the terms of the Company Options to effect the exercise thereof
for shares of Company Common Stock (other than payment of the exercise price
of such Company Options) (together with all other documentation required in
connection with the valid tender of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer), _provided_ , that such exercise shall not be deemed to occur
unless and until Merger Sub accepts for payment and pays for shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer at the Offer Closing. Any
exercise of Company Options in accordance with this Section shall be deemed to
have occurred as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing, and such Paying
Agent shall pay to the holder of the Company Options the aggregate Offer
Price with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Company Options less an amount equal to the aggregate exercise
price of such Company Options so exercised. Holders of Company Options that
tender shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Options in accordance with this Section shall have the right to withdraw such
tender (and revoke the related conditional exercise of such Company Options)
on the same terms and conditions as would apply if they had tendered
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer.

(ii) holders of Company Warrants (whether or not such Company Warrants shall
otherwise be exercisable) may tender shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Company Warrants pursuant to the Offer by delivering to
the Paying Agent prior to the Offer Closing such documents as may be required
pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants to effect the exercise thereof
for shares of Company Common Stock (other than payment of the exercise price
of such Company Warrants) (together with all other documentation required in
connection with the valid tender of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer), _provided_ , that such

 



 

\- 5 -  exercise shall not be deemed to occur unless and until Merger Sub accepts
for payment and pays for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer at the Offer Closing. Any exercise of Company Warrants in
accordance with this Section shall be deemed to have occurred as of
immediately prior to the Offer Closing, and such Paying Agent shall pay to the
holder of the Company Warrants the aggregate Offer Price with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company
Warrants less an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Warrants so exercised. Holders of Company Warrants that tender shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrants in
accordance with this Section shall have the right to withdraw such tender (and
revoke the related conditional exercise of such Company Warrants) on the same
terms and conditions as would apply if they had tendered outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock into the Offer.

(d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any Company Stock Rights that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the
Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement.

(e) Parent, Merger Sub, and the paying agent for the Offer (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Company
Stock Rights such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other provision of
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the appropriate taxing
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Rights to whom such withheld
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Transactions and
represents that:

 

(i) the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously:

 

(A) determined that the Transactions are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the shareholders of the Company;

 

(B) adopted and approved this Agreement and the Transactions and declared it
advisable that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Transactions;

(C) resolved to recommend that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer and
approve the Merger and the Plan of Merger; and



 

\- 6 - (D) taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in the Articles of
Incorporation and Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA will not apply to the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Shareholder Tender
Agreements, or to the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger
(the " _Takeover Statutes_ "); and

(ii) the Continuing Directors of the Company (as such term is defined in
the Companys Articles of Incorporation), voting separately as a subclass of
the Company Board, have unanimously adopted and approved this Agreement and
the Merger pursuant to Section 13.2.2 of the Companys Articles of
Incorporation. 

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing, subject to
Section 6.5(b), the recommendation described in Section 1.2(a)(iii) and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company as and to
the extent required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company
or the Companys legal counsel in writing upon request all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable securities
Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent,
and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders
of the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to
the extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence and summaries of all material oral communications between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment
or supplement thereto) that does not contain or relate to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with the SEC or mailing thereof to the shareholders of
the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9
or response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company
Board contained in the Schedule 14D-9. In the event that the Company receives
any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly to such
comments and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues
raised therein.

 

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall instruct
its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company
Common Stock as of the latest

 



 

\- 7 -  practicable date, together with copies of all lists of shareholders,
security position listings and computer files and all other information in the
Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company
Common Stock, in each case as of the latest date practicable, and shall
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub such information and assistance (including
periodically updated lists of shareholders, security position listings and
computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
holders of Company Common Stock. Except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates, associates and Representatives shall use the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files only in connection with the Offer and
the Merger, shall treat such information and materials in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and, if this Agreement
shall be terminated, will deliver to the Company all copies of such
information then in their possession or under their control promptly upon the
request of the Company.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of shares outstanding, and
the Company shall, promptly following Parents written request, cause
Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including
by increasing the number of directors and seeking and accepting resignations
of incumbent directors (with such method to be by the election of Parent,
including the selection of the individuals designated for resignation). The
Company shall take such actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be
Continuing Directors under the Companys Articles of Incorporation. At each
such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to
constitute the proportional number of members, rounded up to the next whole
number, on each committee of the Company Board in proportion to the number of
directors designated by Parent to the Company Board, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder and, to the extent applicable to a "controlled
company," the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Company shall promptly take all
actions necessary to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including
mailing to its shareholders such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(b), which, unless Parent
otherwise elects, shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent
shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys
obligations under Section 1.3(a) and this Section 1.3(b) shall be subject to
the receipt of such information.

 



 

\- 8 - (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and
until the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
of the Company then in office who were not so designated by Parent shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board, and if any other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required, Parent shall cause the directors designated by Parent to take all
necessary actions required to ratify such actions) (i) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring
action by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time for performance of
any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) any waiver of
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company or any of the Companys rights or benefits hereunder
and (v) any amendment of the Companys Articles of Incorporation.

ARTICLE II

respective successors are duly designated, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or of any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
without limitation all vested and unvested shares of restricted stock, but not
including shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) hereof and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the 



 

\- 10 -  right to receive in cash an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the
Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.2, without interest.

(b)  _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
the shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of
the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled without any conversion, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

 

(d) _Company Options_. Effective as of the Closing, the Company Stock Plans
and all Company Options outstanding immediately before the Closing shall be
cancelled and of no further force or effect. In consideration for such
cancellation of Company Options outstanding under the Company Stock Plans
immediately before the Closing, the holders thereof (whether or not such
Company Options shall otherwise be exercisable at the Effective Time) shall
automatically (and without any further action being required on the part of
the holders thereof) receive, at the Effective Time, an amount of cash equal
to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such
Company Option held by such holder multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per-share exercise price under such
Company Option (with such payments to be subject to any applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with Section 3.1(h)).

(e) _Company Warrants_. Effective as of the Closing, each warrant to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, " _Company Warrants_ ") shall
become a warrant to receive, subject to the conditions set forth therein, an
amount of cash determined pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant. The
Company shall give notice of the Merger to the holders of Company Warrants as
required pursuant to the terms thereof. Following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
any consideration owed to a holder of a Company Warrant in accordance with the
terms of such Company Warrant.

 

(f) _Other Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary such that no Person has any rights to acquire Company
Common Stock or common stock of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement following the Effective Time.

 



 

\- 11 - (g) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. After the date hereof, no future offering
periods shall be commenced under Companys 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " _ESPP_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary such that effective as of immediately prior to the Closing
the ESPP shall terminate and no Person shall hold any right to acquire
Company Stock pursuant to the ESPP on or following the Effective Time.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Options or Company
Warrants such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, is or may be required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other provision of Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the holder of the Company Options or Company Warrants
to whom such withheld amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(i) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
nationally recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of Company Common Stock. All cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, which at the Effective
Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of
the Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may



 

\- 12 -  reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon (1) surrender of the Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto and (2) such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1, and any Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person, other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (I) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (II) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such
surrender.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE III shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE
III shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration. 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any cash remaining in the Exchange Fund that is unclaimed by
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares as of a date immediately
prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of a Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such
date, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.



 

\- 13 - (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former shareholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this ARTICLE III. If at any time the funds held in the Exchange
Fund are insufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub
under this Agreement, Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub to promptly
deposit additional funds held in the Exchange Fund such that the funds held
in the Exchange Fund are thereafter sufficient to satisfy the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this ARTICLE III shall promptly be
paid to Parent.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person that was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, is or may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and under any other provision of Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such
withheld amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and
delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent,
such portion of the Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to
Section 3.1(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than Section 3.3(b)
hereof to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
shareholder who is entitled to dissent from the Merger under Chapter 23B.13 of
the WBCA and who has exercised, when and in the manner required by Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA to the extent so required prior to the Effective Time,
such right to dissent and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shares
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA in connection with the Merger (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration unless and until such shareholder shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders
right to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting
Shares under Chapter 23B.13



 

\- 14 -  of the WBCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect
to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such shareholder under Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to shareholders of record prior to the Effective Time), and holders
of Dissenting Shares shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares, except those provided
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA.

 

(b) If any shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to
obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and
the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such shareholders
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if
the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss is later than the
Effective Time, shall be treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, as set forth in Section 3.1(a) or converted or cancelled in
accordance with of Sections 3.1(b) or (c), as applicable.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices of intent
to demand payment for any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands for payment and any other instruments served
pursuant to the WBCA and received by the Company relating to the exercise of
dissenters rights under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings that take place prior to
the Effective Time with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under
the WBCA. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to the exercise of dissenters
rights or settle or offer to settle any demands for payment with respect to
Dissenting Shares.

 

ARTICLE IV

Except as (i) set forth in the written disclosure letter delivered by the

_provided_ , that any information set forth in one section of the Company

effect that such Company Pension Plan currently is qualified and exempt from

Company Pension Plan adversely or materially increase the costs relating
thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.

Agreement) that are (pursuant to any such understandings, agreements or
undertakings) reasonably expected to result in any material liabilities if

the Transactions nor compliance with the terms hereof will (either alone or in

former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company (each, a "

control or similar payments or benefits, (ii) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any

in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event) by any other
Company Participant who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit
Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or other compensation arrangement in place
before the Closing Date would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no
such other disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional
payment (e.g., any Tax gross up or other payment) from the Company, Parent or
any other Person in the event that the excise Tax required by Section 4999(a)
of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual.

to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, as the
case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, in each
case if known by the party otherwise required to give such notice, which

untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation
or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or

any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings or inquiry with respect to Competition Laws and the Transactions
without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and,
unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any information or proposals submitted in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law with
respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts: (A) to avoid the entry of
any judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, (B) to
eliminate every impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and (C)
vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any
administrative or judicial action.

(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,

party, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
officers, directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any of the matters set forth in Section 6.4(a) or this Section
6.4(b).

 



 

\- 44 - (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
of the Transactions to divest any of its businesses, product lines or assets,
or take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation or
restriction.

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5, the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action
designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal, or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise take any action for the purpose of

reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal and request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to the Offer Closing, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.5(a), the Company may, if a majority of the Company
Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company (including the standards of conduct set forth
in Section 23B.08.300 of the WBCA) under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with this Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(c) and after giving Parent
written notice of such determination, (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which
agreement shall include a customary "standstill" or similar covenant) and
containing provisions allowing necessary disclosures to Parent pursuant to
Section 6.5(c) hereof; _provided_ , that (1) all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent at the time it is
provided to such Person and (2) such customary confidentiality agreement
expressly provides the right for the Company to comply with the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(c), and (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.5(a) by any Representative of the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5(a) by the Company.

 



 

\- 45 - The term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
(whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub) contemplating, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase by such Person, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, of assets that generate 20% or more of the revenues
or constitute 20% or more of the assets of the Company, or 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or the shareholders of any
Person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or of any resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than any
of the Transactions.

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal that did
not arise from a material breach of Section 6.5 or offer constituting a
Company Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition
references to 20% in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to 50%) which a majority of the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Offer and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall, (i)(A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the adoption,
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Transactions or (B)
recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, or other similar agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.5(a) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth
therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer
Closing Date, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if (x) the Company has received a Company Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) a development or a change in
circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was
not known by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and, in the
case of either of the foregoing clauses (x) or (y), a majority of the Company
Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company (including the standards of conduct set forth in
Section 23B.08.300 of the WBCA) under applicable Law; _provided_ , 



 

\- 46 -   _however_ , that no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made
until after the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt
of written notice (a " _Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal, if any, that is the basis of the proposed action by
the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that (1) any amendment to
any material term of the Superior Proposal, if any, resulting in the Company
Notice of Adverse Recommendation or (2) with respect to any previous Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change in the principal stated
rationale by the Company Board for such previous Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, shall, in the case of either of the foregoing clauses
(1) or (2), require a new Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new
three (3) Business Day period). The Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a
Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
fewer than three (3) Business Days remain before the then scheduled Expiration
Date, the notice period with respect to the Company Board effecting a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) shall be no less
than twenty-four (24) hours.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.5(a)
and Section 6.5(b), (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing
no later than twenty-four (24) hours after it receives any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Company Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) the Company shall (A) keep
Parent reasonably and promptly informed of the status of and any material
change to any material term of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry
and (B) provide to Parent promptly after receipt or delivery thereof copies of
all correspondence sent to or received by the Company and all information
provided by the Company to any Person pursuant to such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. In addition, during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Offer Closing, the Company shall not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it is a party. 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its positions thereunder or
(ii) from making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders (including,
without limitation, any amendments to its Schedule 14D-9 relating to a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change) if, in the case of this clause (ii), in the
good faith judgment of a majority of the Company Board, after consultation
with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with
applicable Law.

 

Section 6.6 _Shareholder Litigation_. Prior to termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parents
expense) in the defense or settlement of any shareholder Litigation against
the Company and its directors relating to the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).



 

\- 47 - Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_.

 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, a director or officer of the Company (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law (including to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of
the WBCA adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to
which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors). Each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) business days of
receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefore; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any expenses so advanced if
it is subsequently determined that such Person was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Company Organizational Documents shall contain, and Parent shall cause the
Company Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the
Company than are presently set forth in the Company Organizational Documents.

 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to maintain for not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, at no expense to the beneficiaries, the current policies of
the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefor
would not be in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
Effective Time (such 250%, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Companys
existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year
period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much
directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified
Parties than the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may after the
Offer Closing Date instruct the Company to purchase prior to the Effective
Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Parent providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If such
prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company at the instruction of
Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. 



 

\- 48 - (d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with their enforcement
of their rights provided in this Section 6.7; _provided_ , that such
Indemnified Party is successful in enforcing such claim.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. The provisions of this Section 6.7
are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available by law,
charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.7 shall not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Party and their heirs and representatives, without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other Person.

 

(f) If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) set
forth in this Section 6.7.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.7 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
issue a press release announcing the execution of this Agreement in forms
mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. During the period between the
date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Offer Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company
shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Company, prior to issuing any
press releases with respect to any of the Transactions, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of Nasdaq. In addition, the Company and Parent shall develop a
joint communications strategy with respect to the matters set forth in
Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter and each party shall ensure that,
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the
Offer Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, all public statements and communications (including any
communications that would require a filing under Rules 14d-2 or 14d-9 of the
Exchange Act),

 



 

\- 49 -  with analysts, members of the financial community or otherwise, with respect
to any of the Transactions shall be consistent in all material respects with
such joint communications strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 6.8 shall not apply with respect to any communications regarding any
Company Takeover Proposal or Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 6.9 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Shareholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later
than September 1, 2010, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC,
subject to the prior review and comment of Parent (it being understood that
the Company shall consider in good faith any comments made by Parent), a proxy
statement relating to the Company Shareholder Approval (such proxy statement,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after
clearing comments received from the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing Parent the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The
Company will advise Parent promptly of any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become known to Parent or
the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement necessary
so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys shareholders or at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

(c) The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the approval by the Companys shareholders in
accordance with the WBCA (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_"). The
Company shall ensure that the Company Shareholders Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with applicable Law, the rules of Nasdaq and the Company
Organizational Documents.



 

\- 50 - (d) The parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer
Closing.

Section 6.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and subject in any event to the provisions of
Section 6.1(b), the Company will not, on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Offer Closing, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or
independent contractor of the Company (or any person who would have assumed
such role or performed such duties but for a requirement to refrain from
assuming such role or performing such duties in such plan, program, agreement
or arrangement) that is a shareholder of the Company unless, prior to such
entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (each member of which shall be an "independent
director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps
as may be necessary to (i) approve as an employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement. The Company shall, prior to the Offer
Closing, take such actions necessary and appropriate to ratify, confirm and
approve, in accordance with and for the purpose of Rule 14d-10 under the
Exchange Act, compensation paid or payable to Covered Employees under any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions.

Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall take
all actions necessary so that the restrictions contained in Chapter 23B.19 of
the WBCA shall remain inapplicable to any and all of the Transactions. If any
other Takeover Statute becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that any such Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

Section 6.13 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote (or cause to be voted) all
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or Merger Sub in
favor of approval of the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 

Section 6.14 No _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Offer Closing Date,
and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries



 

\- 51 -  operations prior to the Offer Closing Date. Prior to the Offer Closing Date,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective operations.

Section 6.15 _Sixth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Strategic Alliance
Agreement_. On the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company will execute
the Sixth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Strategic Alliance Agreement
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_.

 

Section 6.16 _Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation (excluding equity based compensation) that,
taken as a whole, has a value not materially less, in the aggregate, than the
compensation provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to such
employees as of the date hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered
Employees who remain employed during such period by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries with compensation
(excluding equity based compensation) that, taken as a whole, has a value not
materially less, in the aggregate, than the compensation provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time. In
addition, for a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered
Employees who remain employed during such period by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries with benefits that, taken as a
whole, have a value not materially less, in the aggregate, than the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries from
time to time.

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Covered Employees whose
employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with severance
benefits in accordance with such employees individual compensatory
agreement, if any, or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance
with the Companys severance policy in effect on the date hereof as set forth
in Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall have no
obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans
(except with respect to existing individual compensatory agreements) or to
continue the employment of any specific Person.

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including
for purposes of vacation eligibility), but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive service credit for service with
the Company (and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company granted service credit) as if such service had
been completed with Parent; provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service. 



 

\- 52 - (d) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use
reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any pre-
existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or covered
dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to
the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer subject to
such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent
was participating immediately before he or she became eligible to participate
in the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any Company Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for
such calendar year under any New Plan in which such Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.16 shall (i) confer any rights or remedies of
any kind or description upon any Covered Employee or any other Person other
than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns, (ii)
be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the
ability to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
benefit plan or agreement of Parent or (iii) limit the ability of the Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time.

which by applicable Law otherwise expressly requires the further approval of
such shareholders. No amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholders Meeting,

covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (b) waive
any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of

an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly



 

\- 57 -  authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts
and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other

     | (v) | the Company shall have performed in all material respects
all obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior

asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except
for the Minimum Tender Condition (defined herein)), in each case, subject to
the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.
