           AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of
December 16, 2004, by and between Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("PARENT"), and Woronoco Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY").

                             W I T N E S S E T H:

           WHEREAS, each of Parent and the Company desire to enter into a
transaction whereby the Company will merge with and into Parent (the "MERGER"),
with Parent being the surviving corporation, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY
COMMON STOCK") will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(b));

           WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
have each approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and determined
that the Merger is advisable; and

           WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and
that this Agreement be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER


     SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Company shall be
merged with and into Parent at the Effective Time (as defined below). Following
the Effective Time, Parent shall be the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations
of the Company in accordance with the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.2 CLOSING. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to closing contained in Article VI hereof, the closing of the Merger
(the "CLOSING") will take place at 9:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the
parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which date shall be no later than the fifth
Business Day (as defined herein) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The
Closing will be held at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
("WACHTELL, LIPTON"), 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 or at such
other location as is agreed to by the parties hereto. "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean
Monday through Friday of each week, except a legal holiday recognized as such by
the



<PAGE>


U.S. Government or any day on which banking institutions in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts are authorized or obligated to close.

     SECTION 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to
effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being hereinafter referred to as the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

     SECTION 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION. The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Parent, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time and subject to applicable law, the
directors of Parent and Berkshire Bank ("PARENT BANK") shall respectively
consist of the directors of Parent and Parent Bank in office immediately prior
to the Effective Time, together with Cornelius Mahoney and two other individuals
designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent from among those
currently serving on the board of directors of the Company (these three
individuals being collectively referred to as the "COMPANY HOLDING COMPANY
DESIGNEES" and the "COMPANY BANK DESIGNEES," respectively), in each case as
provided in Section 5.14, until their successors shall have been duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Parent and
Parent Bank, as applicable.

     (b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Parent shall become
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE II

                   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                        OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     SECTION 2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:



                                       2
<PAGE>



     (a) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than shares held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of debts previously contracted)
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

     (b) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to the provisions of this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled and retired
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 2.4)) shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.5 below and subject to
Section 2.3, into the right to receive the following, without interest:

          (i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
     election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost
     pursuant to Section 2.5 (a "CASH ELECTION"), the right to receive in cash
     from Parent, without interest, an amount equal to $36.00 (the "CASH
     CONSIDERATION") (collectively, "CASH ELECTION SHARES");

          (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
     election to receive common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
     ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost
     pursuant to Section 2.5 (a "STOCK ELECTION"), the right to receive from
     Parent 1.00 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") share of Parent Common Stock (the "STOCK
     CONSIDERATION") (collectively, the "STOCK ELECTION SHARES"); and

          (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to
     which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not
     revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.5 ( "NON-ELECTION SHARES"), the right
     to receive from Parent such Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration
     as is determined in accordance with Section 2.3(c).

     The Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to
     herein collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION." Upon such conversion,
     all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
     shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
     each Company Stock Certificate (as defined in Section 2.5(d)) shall
     thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash
     for fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5(l) and any dividends
     or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(k) upon the surrender of
     the Company Stock Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof.

          SECTION 2.2 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND COMPANY STOCK-BASED AWARDS.

     (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") granted
pursuant to the Company's 2004 Equity Compensation Plan, 2001 Stock Option Plan
or Amended and Restated 1999 Stock-Based Incentive Plan (the "COMPANY STOCK
PLANS") shall be



                                       3
<PAGE>


assumed by Parent and shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
share) (an "ASSUMED STOCK OPTION") at an exercise price determined as provided
below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plans and the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder):

          (i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to the
     Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the number of whole shares of
     Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior
     to the Effective Time; and

          (ii) The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the
     Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share,
     rounded to the nearest whole cent, of Company Common Stock under the
     Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

In the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies
by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion
formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock Options shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding
Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to
Parent.

     (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a
number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting
of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company Stock Plans or
accrued under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for the Company Bank
(the "EXCESS ESOP"), including restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance stock units and deferred stock units and excluding the Company Stock
Options (each, a "COMPANY STOCK-BASED AWARD"), whether vested or unvested, which
is outstanding or unsatisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (an "ASSUMED STOCK-BASED AWARD"), on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock-Based
Awards, provided that all such rights or awards shall vest as of the Effective
Time to the extent provided, as of the date hereof, by their terms. The number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Stock-Based Award
shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Stock-Based Award, rounded to the nearest whole share.

     (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company
Stock Plans and take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of the
Assumed Stock Options and settlement of the Assumed Stock-Based Awards. On or as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event more than ten
Business Days after the Closing Date), Parent shall file a registration
statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously
filed registration statement under the Securities Act (as defined below) with
respect to the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Assumed Stock Options and the Assumed



                                       4
<PAGE>


Stock-Based Awards and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such stock options remain outstanding.

     (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all actions
necessary to effectuate this Section 2.2, including the approval of any
amendments to the Company's Stock Plans and the Excess ESOP.

     SECTION 2.3 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS; PRORATION.

     (a) If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or
combination, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued
in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall occur (any such action, a
"PARENT ADJUSTMENT EVENT"), the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted
to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Parent Adjustment Event.

     (b) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (1)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the "STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER") shall
be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
0.75 and (2) all of the other shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into Cash
Consideration (in case of each of clauses (1) and (2), excluding shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting
Shares).

     (c) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.5) to effect the allocation among
holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration as follows:

          (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with
     respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "STOCK ELECTION
     NUMBER") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares
     and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into
     the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of
     each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Stock
     Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to
     the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares
     held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock
     Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election
     Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares
     being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and

          (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
     Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
     Election Number being referred to herein as the "SHORTFALL NUMBER"), then
     all



                                       5
<PAGE>


          Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
          Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election
          Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

                    (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
               number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares
               shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
               Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof
               shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
               Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares
               equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
               Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
               numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of
               which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the
               remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being
               converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

                    (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
               Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be
               converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and
               Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted
               into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
               that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
               by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by
               such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of
               Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total
               number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such
               holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
               receive the Cash Consideration.

     SECTION 2.4 SHARES OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under the DGCL (the
"DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under
the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right after the Election Deadline, each share of such
holder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
any interest thereon, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash Election
Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or
demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or




                                       6
<PAGE>


notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise
negotiate, any such demands.

     SECTION 2.5 ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("HOLDER") shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to
submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

     (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.5 (herein called an "ELECTION") (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to
make a Cash Election.

     (b) Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited in trust with the Exchange Agent certificates representing the Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii), cash sufficient to pay the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i), cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.5(l) and any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.5(k). Any cash and certificates of Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCHANGE FUND." Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "FORM OF ELECTION") which shall be mailed to the Company's
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of the stockholders of the Company
at which the stockholders of the Company consider and vote on this Agreement
(the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") so as to permit the Company's stockholders
to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline (as
defined below).

     (c) Parent shall make the Form of Election initially available at the time
that the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is made available to the
stockholders of the Company, to such stockholders, and shall use all reasonable
efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election following the
initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In
no event shall the Form of Election be made available less than twenty (20) days
prior to the Election Deadline.

     (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Person
authorized to receive Elections and to act as Exchange Agent under this
Agreement, which Person shall be designated by Parent and not reasonably
objected to by the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), shall have received, by 5:00
p.m. New York City time, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates of the
shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES") to which such
Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of
such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in
the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to
deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery
within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate



                                       7
<PAGE>


any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in
its sole discretion. As used herein, "ELECTION DEADLINE" means 5:00 p.m. New
York City time on the date that is the day prior to the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to issue a press
release announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15)
Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election
Deadline.

     (e) If Parent shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any
Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely
made.

     (f) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and
signed, revised Form of Election. Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior
to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received
by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to
the Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate, or of the
guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange
Agent is notified in writing by Parent that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Article VII.

     (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable. The Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation and such amounts shall
be delivered by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation to the
applicable taxing authority.

     (h) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If,
after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.




                                       8

     (i) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holders of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.5 shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5(l) and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
2.5(k). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger
Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     (j) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid dividends
and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement.

     (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.5(l) below, and
all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 2.5(o) below. Subject to the effect
of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate
there shall be paid to the Holder of a certificate for Parent Common Stock (a
"PARENT STOCK CERTIFICATE") representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date prior to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to
the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes, if necessary.

          (l)  (i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock
               representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or
               book-



                                       9
<PAGE>


               entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for
               exchange of Company Stock Certificates and such fractional share
               interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have
               any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of
               Parent Common Stock.

               (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
               holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
               the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
               fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
               account all Company Stock Certificates delivered by such holder)
               shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
               amount equal to the product of: (i) such fractional part of a
               share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the closing price
               for a share of Parent Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange
               (the "AMEX") on the third trading day immediately preceding the
               Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the
               determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to
               holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so
               notify the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
               shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause
               the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
               fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms
               hereof.

     (m) Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by
any Company Stockholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the
manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations prescribed by Section 2.5, (C) the issuance and delivery of
Parent Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of
the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.

     (n) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
promptly be paid to Parent, if resulting prior to the Effective Time, or to the
Surviving Corporation, if resulting following the Effective Time.

     (o) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Company
Stock Certificate who did not properly complete and submit a Form of Election:
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of such certificates) to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of




                                       10
<PAGE>


Transmittal shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may reasonably specify
("LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
such Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and
any cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.5(k) or 2.5(l)). Upon surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii), and (ii) a check for the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has a right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) and for the cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.5, including cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5(l) and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(k). No interest will
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to Section 2.5(k) or Section 2.5(l).

     (p) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article
II (including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.5(k) or 2.5(l)) shall be
deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of Company Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.5, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration (and any cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.5(k) or
2.5(l)).

     (q) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions
and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

                              ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


     SECTION 3.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") and making
reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is
being taken, the Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

     (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER.

          (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
     legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
     respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of
     the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate
     or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business
     as now being conducted, except, as to Subsidiaries other than Woronoco
     Savings Bank ("COMPANY BANK"), for those jurisdictions where the failure to
     be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect to the Company. Each of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
     standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
     ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification
     or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
     be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a
     savings and loan holding company with the Office of Thrift Supervision (the
     "OTS") under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (the "HOLA"), and Company
     Bank is a Massachusetts chartered savings bank duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts.

          (ii) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent prior to
     the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents,
     as amended to date, of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

          (iii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, the minute books of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in all
     material respects, contain accurate records of all meetings and accurately
     reflect all other material actions taken by the stockholders of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries, the boards of directors of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries and all standing committees of the boards of directors of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries.

     (b) SUBSIDIARIES. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
all the Subsidiaries of the Company, whether consolidated or unconsolidated, and
sets forth the issued and outstanding securities of each of such Subsidiaries
and its jurisdiction of incorporation. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, all



                                       12
<PAGE>


outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Subsidiary: (i) have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable;
(ii) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind
or nature whatsoever, other than those imposed generally on similar entities
under applicable law (collectively, "LIENS"), and other than Company Permitted
Liens (as defined in this Section 3.1(b)); and (iii) other than Company
Permitted Liens, are free of any other material restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests) that would prevent the operation by the
Surviving Corporation of such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries conducts any operations outside
of the United States or conducts any operations that are subject to any
regulatory oversight by Governmental Entities (as defined below in Section
3.1(d)) outside of the United States. Other than the Subsidiaries of the
Company, the Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, a 5% or
greater equity interest in any corporation, company, association, partnership,
joint venture or other entity, nor is any corporation, company, association,
partnership, joint venture or other entity consolidated with the Company for
financial reporting purposes. For purpose of this Section 3.1(b) (except as
indicated) and elsewhere through this Agreement "COMPANY PERMITTED LIENS" shall
mean (A) Liens described in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
(B) restrictions on transferability pursuant to federal and state securities
laws; and (C) Liens for Taxes not yet due or delinquent or being contested in
good faith and for which reserves appropriate in all material respects have been
established in accordance with GAAP (as defined in Section 3.1(e)(ii)). The
deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Bank Insurance Fund (the "BIF")
to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments
required in connection therewith have been paid by the Company Bank.

     (c) CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 16,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"). As
of the date of this Agreement: (i) 3,657,336 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding; (ii) 2,341,524 shares of Company Common Stock were held
by the Company in its treasury and no shares of Company Common Stock were held
by Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were

the Company in its treasury or were held by any Subsidiary of the Company; (v)
1,112,755 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans, of which 503,991 shares are subject to outstanding
Company Stock Options; and (vi) 22,295 shares of Company Common Stock are
subject to Company Stock-Based Awards that are accrued as of the date hereof
under the Excess ESOP. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
are, and all shares thereof which may be issued prior to the Closing will be,
when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to preemptive rights. The Company has delivered to Parent a true and
complete list, as of the close of business on the date of this Agreement, of all
outstanding Company Stock Options granted under the Company Stock Plans and all
outstanding and unvested Company Stock-Based Awards granted or accrued under the
Company Stock Plans and the Excess ESOP, or otherwise granted, the number of
shares subject to each such Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award,
the grant dates, the vesting schedule and the exercise prices (if any) of each
such Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award




                                       13
<PAGE>


and the names of the holders thereof. Except as set forth in this Section
3.1(c), (x) there are not issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any
shares of capital stock or voting securities or other ownership interests of the
Company, (B) any securities of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities or other ownership interests of the Company, or (C) any
warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, or any obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership
interests in, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for,
capital stock or voting securities or other ownership interests of the Company,
and (y) there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities, other than pursuant to any "cashless exercise" provision of any
Company Stock Options as previously disclosed to Parent. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding (A)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities or
other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, (B) warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any
capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital
stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the
Company or (C) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such outstanding securities of
Subsidiaries of the Company or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, any such securities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and, to the knowledge of the Company as of the date
hereof, no other Person having beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"))
of 5% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock (a "MAJOR COMPANY
STOCKHOLDER") is a party, to any agreement restricting the transfer of, relating
to the voting of, requiring registration of, or granting any preemptive or
antidilutive rights with respect to any of the securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or, to
the knowledge of the Company as of the date hereof, any Major Company

non-competition or exclusive dealing agreement, or any other agreement or
obligation which purports to limit or restrict in any respect (A) the ability of

<PAGE>


agreements, contracts and obligations of the type described in clauses (i)
through (xv) being referred to herein as "COMPANY MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). Each
Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company (or, to the extent
a Subsidiary of the Company is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party thereto and is in full force and effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any
Company Material Contract except where any such breach or default would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default under
(nor, to the knowledge of the Company, does there exist any condition which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under) any Company Material Contract by any other party
thereto except where any such violation or default would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of all Company Material Contracts. There are no
provisions in any Instrument of Indebtedness that provide any restrictions on
the repayment of the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder, or that require that
any financial payment (other than payment of outstanding principal and accrued
interest) be made in the event of the repayment of the outstanding Indebtedness
thereunder prior to expiration. For purposes of this Section 3.1(f) and
elsewhere through this Agreement, "INDEBTEDNESS" of a Person shall mean (i) all
obligations of such Person for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations of such
Person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes and similar instruments, (iii) all
leases of such Person capitalized in accordance with GAAP, and (iv) all
obligations of such Person under sale-and-leaseback transactions, agreements to
repurchase securities sold and other similar financing transactions.

in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and

specifically identified in the Company SEC Documents filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof (as amended to the date hereof, "COMPANY
FILED SEC DOCUMENTS"), since September 30, 2004, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses, in all material
respects only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and there has not been:

     Company Common Stock, or any other equity-based award, to any directors,
     officers, Employees or consultants of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries (in any event identifying in Section 3.1(g)(ii) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule the issue date, exercise price and vesting schedule, as
     applicable, for issuances thereto since September 30, 2004),

          (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or

     Common Stock, and other than dividends

          paid by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company to the Company or
          any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,

               (iv) any split, combination or reclassification of any of the
          Company's capital stock, or any issuance or the authorization of any
          issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
          substitution for shares of the Company's capital stock, except for
          issuances of Company Common Stock or upon the exercise of Company

          their present terms,

               (v) (A) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
          any current or former directors, executive officers, Employees or

          business consistent with past practice, (y) as required from time to
          time by applicable law affecting wages and (z) as required by the

          of, any employment, deferred compensation, consulting, severance,
          termination or indemnification agreement with any such current or
          former directors, officers, Employees or consultants, except as
          required from time to time by applicable law, or (D) acceleration of

     Subsidiaries are licensed to conduct business. The Company, its
     Subsidiaries and Employees hold all permits, licenses, variances,
     authorizations, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all
     Governmental Entities (the "PERMITS") that are required for the operation
     of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
     presently conducted, except insofar as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and for the last five
     years has been, in compliance in all respects with the terms of such
     Permits and all such Permits are in full force and effect and no
     suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the
     knowledge of the Company, threatened nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
     do grounds exist for any such action, except where non-compliance or such
     suspension, modification or revocation would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Company.

          (ii) Except where failure to comply would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Company, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and for the last
     five years has been, in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws,
     regulations, ordinances, Permits, rules, judgments, orders, decrees or
     arbitration awards of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Company or
     its Subsidiaries.

          (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
     any outstanding order, injunction or decree or is a party to any written
     agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a
     party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to
     any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any supervisory letter from
     or has adopted any resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity
     that restricts in any respect the conduct of its business or that in any
     respect relates to its capital adequacy, its policies, its management or
     its business (each, a "COMPANY REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as defined in Section 8.3(a)) (A)
     to the Company's knowledge, been advised since January 1, 2002 by any
     Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any such
     Company Regulatory Agreement or (B) have knowledge of any pending or
     threatened investigation by any Governmental Entity. Neither the Company
     nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any Company
     Regulatory Agreement in any material respect. Prior to the date hereof, the
     Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
     Company Regulatory Agreements.

          (iv) Except for filings with the SEC, which are the subject of Section
     3.1(e), since January 1, 2002, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
     have timely filed all regulatory reports, schedules, forms, registrations
     and other documents, together with any amendments required to be made with
     respect thereto, that they were required to file with any Governmental
     Entity (the "OTHER COMPANY DOCUMENTS"), and



                                       20
<PAGE>


     have timely paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
     therewith, except where the failure to make such payments and filings would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
     a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There is no material unresolved
     violation or exception by any of such Governmental Entities with respect to
     any report or statement relating to any examinations of the Company or any
     of its Subsidiaries. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
     a true and complete copy of each material Other Company Document requested
     by Parent.

          (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
     respective directors, officers or Employees has been the subject of any
     disciplinary proceedings or orders of any Governmental Entity arising under
     applicable laws or regulations which would be required to be disclosed in
     any Other Company Document except as disclosed therein, and no such
     disciplinary proceeding or order is pending, nor to the knowledge of the
     Company threatened, except where non-disclosure, or such preceding or
     order, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
     to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (vi) The Company Bank is "well-capitalized" and "well managed" under
     applicable regulatory definitions, and its examination rating under the
     Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is "high satisfactory."

     knowledge of the Company, any "affiliated person" (as defined in the
     Investment Company Act) of the Company or any of its Affiliates, is
     ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) or 9(b) of the Investment Company Act
     of 1940 to act as, or subject to any disqualification which would form a
     reasonable basis for any denial, suspension or revocation of the
     registration of or licenses or for any limitation on the activities of the
     Company or any of its Affiliates as, an investment advisor (or in any other
     capacity contemplated by said Act) to a registered investment company.
     Neither the Company or any of its Affiliates, nor to the knowledge of the
     Company, any "associated person of a broker or dealer" (as defined in the
     Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its Affiliates, is ineligible
     pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act to act as a broker-dealer or
     as an associated person to a registered broker-dealer or is subject to a
     "statutory disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange
     Act or otherwise ineligible to serve as a broker-dealer or as an associated
     person to a registered broker-dealer.

          (viii)The business and operations of the Company and of each of the
     Company's Subsidiaries through which the Company conducts its finance
     activities have been conducted in compliance with all applicable statutes
     and regulations regulating the business of consumer lending, including

     any loan or credit



                                       21
<PAGE>


     extension of such Subsidiaries, except where non-compliance would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company. In addition, there is no pending
     or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened charge by any Governmental
     Entity that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has violated any
     applicable Finance Laws, except insofar as would not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Effect on the Company.

          (ix) Since January 1, 2002, neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any other Person acting
     on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a
     "financial institution" under the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws, has
     knowingly acted, by itself or in conjunction with another, in any act in
     connection with the concealment of any currency, securities, other
     proprietary interest that is the result of a felony as defined in the U.S.
     Anti-Money Laundering laws ("UNLAWFUL GAINS"), nor knowingly accepted,
     transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale, purchase or any
     transaction of other nature for Unlawful Gains, except insofar as would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
     a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and each of its
     Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "financial institution" under the U.S.
     Anti-Money Laundering laws has, during the past three years, implemented
     such anti-money laundry mechanisms and kept and filed all material reports
     and other necessary material documents as required by, and otherwise
     complied with, the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws and the rules and

investigation by any Governmental Entity and no litigation, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or arbitration by any Person or Governmental Entity,
in each case with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or Permits, is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

     Entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under
     applicable laws, except for payments that would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company.

          (iv) No Federal, state, local or foreign audits or other
     administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending with
     regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
     received a written notice of any pending or proposed claims, audits or
     proceedings with respect to Taxes, the payment of which would reasonably be
     expected to be material to the Company.

          (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted in

     has not since been filed and no currently effective waivers, extensions, or
     comparable consents regarding the application of the statute of limitations
     with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns has been given by or on behalf of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
     any agreement providing for the allocation, sharing or indemnification of

          (x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted
     either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within
     the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
     to which Section 355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 of the Code as
     relates to Section 355 of the Code) applies and which occurred within five
     years of the date of this Agreement.

          (xi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have agreed, or
     is required, to make any adjustment under Section 481 of the Code affecting
     any taxable year.

     (k) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

          (i) Section 3.1(k)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes a
     complete list of all material Company Plans and all Employment Agreements.
     As used herein, (A) "COMPANY PLAN" means any employee benefit plan,
     program, policy, practices, or other arrangement providing benefits to any
     current or former Employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored
     or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to
     contribute, whether or not written, including without limitation any
     employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), any
     employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
     (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) and any bonus, incentive,
     deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance,
     employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan, program or policy,
     and (B) "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT" means a contract, offer letter or agreement
     of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any
     individual who is rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee
     or consultant pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
     any actual or contingent liability or



                                       25
<PAGE>

     obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for
     past, present or future services.

          (ii) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered or made
     available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each of the
     following documents: (A) each Plan, and any amendments thereto (or if the
     Plan is not a written plan, a description thereof); (B) the most recent
     Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (C) the
     most recent Summary Plan Description (required under ERISA); (D) the most
     recent annual financial report, if any; (E) the most recent actuarial
     report, if any; and (F) the most recent determination letter from the IRS,
     if any. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a true,
     correct and complete copy of each Employment Agreement. Except as
     specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered to Parent or as
     contemplated by the transactions under the Agreement, there are no
     amendments to any Plan or Employment Agreement that have been adopted or
     approved nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make
     any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan or Employment
     Agreement. As used herein, (A) "PLAN" means any Company Plan other than a
     Multiemployer Plan and (B) "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN" means any "multiemployer
     plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

          (iii) Section 3.1(k)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
     identifies each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the
     meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("QUALIFIED PLANS"). The Internal
     Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to
     each Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, and
     the Company knows of no existing circumstances and no events have occurred
     that could adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or
     the related trust. No trust funding any Plan is intended to meet the
     requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).

          (iv) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Plan by
     applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
     undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
     policies funding any Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been
     timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or
     paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Company
     Filed SEC Documents. Each Company Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
     plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded through an insurance
     company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the meaning of
     Section 419 of the Code or (B) is unfunded.

          (v) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company and its
     Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material
     respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
     regulations applicable to such Company Plans. Each Plan has been
     administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
     applicable law. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that could
     give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a
     Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code.



                                       26
<PAGE>


          (vi) No Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
     412 or 4971 of the Code.

          (vii) No Company Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two
     or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
     control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER
     PLAN"). None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their
     respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
     contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
     Multiple Employer Plan. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any
     ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been
     satisfied in full. As used herein, (A) "ERISA AFFILIATE" means, with
     respect to any entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or
     business that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of a group
     described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
     4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or included the first entity, trade or
     business, or that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of the same
     "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to
     Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA and (B) "WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY" means liability
     to a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a
     complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
     Employer Plan, as those terms are defined in Subtitle D and in Part I of
     Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

          (viii)There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that
     could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability
     of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing. As used
     herein, "CONTROLLED GROUP LIABILITY" means any and all liabilities (i)
     under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under
     Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a failure to comply
     with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 ET SEQ. of ERISA
     and Section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar
     provisions of foreign laws or regulations. Without limiting the generality
     of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
     of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction
     described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

          (ix) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life,
     health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or
     beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation
     coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of
     ERISA and at no expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company
     and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or
     modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for retiree health
     or life insurance coverage.

          (x) Section 3.1(k)(x)(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
     (A) an accurate list of any Plan or Employment Agreement under which the
     execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with
     any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or
     delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
     any Employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, or could limit the right of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
     from any Company Plan or related trust or any Employment Agreement or
     related trust, and (B) a reasonable estimate of the amount of the "excess
     parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that
     could become payable by the Company or any of its


                                       27
<PAGE>


     Subsidiaries, or could limit the right of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
     from any Company Plan or related trust or any Employment Agreement or
     related trust, and (B) a reasonable estimate of the amount of the "excess
     parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that
     could become payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
     connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
     conjunction with any other event). Prior to the date hereof, the Company
     has taken all necessary action to ensure that the Plans and Employment
     Agreements identified in Section 3.1(k)(x)(B) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule have been amended (and the Employees participating in any such
     Plans or party to any such Employment Agreements have agreed in writing to
     such amendments) in a manner consistent with the agreement among the
     parties hereto, such that the maximum aggregate liability of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether such
     liability is paid or payable prior to or after the Merger), under such
     Plans and Employment Agreements, together with the liabilities under any
     similar plans and agreements of or with the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, whether or not identified in Section 3.1(k)(x)(B) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule, shall not exceed the aggregate amount
     identified on in Section 3.1(k)(x)(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (xi) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other person,
     including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as
     defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could
     subject any of the Company Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any
     of its Subsidiaries or any person that the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty
     imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

          (xii) There are no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
     claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
     arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Company's
     knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to
     a claim or lawsuit, against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect
     to their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any
     of the Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material
     liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit
     Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor,
     any Multiemployer Plan, any Plan, any participant in a Plan, or any other
     party.

          (xiii)The Company, its Subsidiaries and each member of their
     respective business enterprises has complied with the Worker Adjustment and
     Retraining Notification Act and all similar state, local and foreign laws.

          (xiv) The Company Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
     "ESOP") is an "employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of Section
     4975(e)(7) of the Code. Section 3.1(k)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule identifies (A) each loan under which the ESOP is a borrower (each,
     a "LOAN"), (B) the lender and guarantor (if any) of each Loan, and (C) the
     securities of the Company that



                                       28
<PAGE>


     were acquired with such Loan (the "EMPLOYER SECURITIES"). Each Loan meets
     the requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of the Code. The Employer Securities
     are in each case pledged as collateral for the Loan with which they were
     acquired, except to the extent they have been released from such pledge and
     allocated to the accounts of participants in the ESOP in accordance with
     the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 54.4985-7 and 54.4975-11.

          (xv) Each individual who renders services to the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary, as
     applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other
     non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and
     tax reporting and under Company Plans) is properly so characterized.

          (xvi) With respect to each Company Plan that is a Multiple Employer
     Plan, except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(xvi) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule: (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of
     their respective ERISA Affiliates, has received any notification, nor has
     any actual knowledge, that if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
     of their respective ERISA Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or
     partial withdrawal from such plan, it would incur Withdrawal Liability that
     would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company; and (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor any of
     their respective ERISA Affiliates has received any notification, nor has
     any reason to believe, that any Company Plan is in reorganization, has been
     terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in
     reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated.

          (xvii)There is and has been no loan or extension of credit to any
     director, officer or Employee of the Company that has caused or would cause
     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of the
     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

     (l) LABOR MATTERS. There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements
to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party. There is no
union organizing effort pending or, the Company's knowledge, threatened against
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. There is no labor strike, labor
dispute (other than routine Employee grievances that are not related to union
Employees), work slowdown, stoppage or lockout pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company (other than routine Employee grievances that are not related to
union Employees) which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, and are not, to the knowledge of the Company, engaged in any
unfair labor practice, except insofar as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

     (m) ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. There are no pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions, causes



                                       29
<PAGE>


of action, notices, private environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations of any nature (including claims of
alleging potential liability for investigating costs, cleanup costs,
governmental response costs, natural resources damage, property damages,
personal injuries or penalties) by any Person (collectively, "ENVIRONMENTAL
CLAIMS"), or any conditions or circumstances that could form the basis of any
Environmental Claim, in each case seeking to impose on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or that reasonably would be expected to result in the imposition
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, any liability or obligation that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company arising under applicable common law standards relating to pollution or
protection of the environment, human health or safety, or under any local, state
or Federal environmental statute, regulation, ordinance, decree, judgment or
order relating to pollution or protection of the environment, human health or

     force and effect, and have not been cancelled, expired, abandoned or

     opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding before any court or
     registration authority in any jurisdiction against the registrations and

     used by the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than any such proceeding
     which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
     to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (iv) To the Company's knowledge, the conduct of the Company's and its
     Subsidiaries' business as currently conducted or planned by the Company to
     be conducted does not, in any respect, infringe upon (either directly or

     infringe), dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual
     Property owned or controlled by any third party, except insofar as would

     dilution, misappropriation or violation.

          (v) To the Company's knowledge, no third party is misappropriating,
     infringing, diluting, or violating any material Intellectual Property owned

comparable replacements or substitutions) be kept in full force and effect by
the Company through the Effective Time. All such policies, considered
collectively with other such policies providing the same type of coverage, are
sufficient for compliance with all requirements of law and of all requirements
under contracts or leases to which the Company is a party, except where
non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All premiums

to and including the Effective Time have been paid to the extent such premiums
are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof and, with respect to premiums
not due or payable at or prior to the date hereof, all premiums due and payable
prior to the Effective Time, will have been paid prior to the Effective Time,
except where the failure to pay any such premium would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with
respect to any such policy material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

     (p) INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or to be

          repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity),
          free and clear of any Lien, except for Company Permitted Liens and
          except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the
          ordinary course of business consistent with past practice to secure
          obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such securities and
          commodities are valued on the books of the Company in accordance with

     PROCEDURES") which the Company believes are prudent and reasonable in the
     context of such businesses. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has made
     available to Parent the material Policies, Practices and Procedures.

     (x) LOAN PORTFOLIO; SERVICING.

          (i) All loans owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,

     or in which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has an interest,
     have been made or acquired by the Company in accordance with board of

     such mortgages evidence liens having the priority indicated by the terms of

     equity or the availability of the remedy of specific performance or

     originated by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and subsequently
     sold by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company have been sold without
     recourse to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and without any
     liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. True, correct
     and complete copies of loan delinquency reports as of October 31, 2004
     prepared by the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company, which reports
     include all loans delinquent or otherwise in default, have been furnished
     to Parent. True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective
     lending policies and practices of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
     Company also have been furnished or made available to Parent.

          (iii) Except as set forth at Section 3.1(x) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, each outstanding loan participation sold by the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company was sold with the risk of non-payment of all or
     any portion of that underlying loan to be shared by each participant
     (including the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) proportionately to
     the share of such loan represented by such participation without any
     recourse of such other lender or participant to the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company for payment or repurchase of the amount of such
     loan represented by the participation or liability under any yield
     maintenance or similar obligation. The Company and any Subsidiary of the
     Company have properly fulfilled in all material respects its contractual
     responsibilities and duties in any loan in which it acts as the lead lender
     or servicer and has complied in all material respects with its duties as
     required under applicable regulatory requirements.


          (iv) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company have properly
     perfected or caused to be properly perfected all security interests, liens,
     or other interests in any collateral securing any loans made by it, except

     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company.

          (v) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
     cancellation or reduction of any loan purchase commitment or other loan
     sale contract or arrangement to which the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries is a party, and the obligations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries under each such commitment, contract or arrangement are being
     performed by the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries in accordance with
     its terms in all material respects.

     list of all loans or other extensions of credit to all directors, officers
     and employees, or any other person covered by Regulation O of the Board of
     Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

     (y) REAL PROPERTY.

          (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good title free and

                                       35
<PAGE>


          (ii) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real property (such
     agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other
     supplements thereto, collectively, the "LEASES") has heretofore been made
     available to Parent, except as set forth in Section 3.1(y) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule. Each Lease is valid, binding and enforceable against
     the Company or its applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and
     is in full force and effect, except that (x) such enforceability may be
     subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
     laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and
     (y) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunction or
     other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
     would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
     therefor may be brought. There are no defaults by the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any of the Leases which, in the
     aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Company. The consummation of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Leases,
     except for any such default which would not individually or in the
     aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (iii) The Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the
     Leases (the "LEASED PROPERTIES") constitute all of the real estate on which
     the Company and its Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their
     business as of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of
     which would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
     Owned Properties and the Leased Properties are in compliance with all laws,
     except where non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
     Company. Neither any agreement relating to the Owned Properties nor any of
     the Leases requires consent of any third party for the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby except for (i) such consents which will be
     obtained prior to Closing or (ii) such consents the failure of which to
     obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
     to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (iv) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases real property to a third party
     (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other
     supplements thereto, collectively, the "THIRD PARTY LEASES") has heretofore
     been made available to Parent. Each Third Party Lease is valid, binding and
     enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect,
     except that (x) such enforceability may be subject to applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter
     in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (y) the availability of
     the remedy of specific performance or injunction or other forms of
     equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject
     to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
     brought. There are no existing defaults by the tenant under any Third Party
     Lease which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such
     Third Party Leases, except for any such default which would not reasonably
     be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
     cause defaults under the Third Party Leases,



                                       36
<PAGE>


     except for any such default which would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     (z) ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary or
agent, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee,
agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment
advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable
state and federal law and regulation and common law, except where the failure to
do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their directors, officers, agents or Employees,
has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary or agency
account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary or agency account are true
and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary or agency
account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and accurate
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     (aa) INTERNAL CONTROLS. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(aa) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the records, systems, controls, data and
information of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any
non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed
only in accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is
compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and
other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (1) has designed
disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
such entity and its Subsidiaries is made known to the management of such entity
(or its general partner) by others within those entities as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and (2)
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A)
any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have disclosed to its auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in its internal controls. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made
available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Company's auditors and audit



                                       37

committee since August 29, 2002. The Company has initiated its process of
compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and expects to be in full
compliance therewith by the SEC mandated compliance date.

     (bb) RESERVES FOR LOSSES. All reserves or other allowances for possible
losses reflected in the Company's financial statements referred to in Section
3.1(e) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the three quarters
ended September 30, 2004, complied with the standards established by applicable
Governmental Entities and were adequate under GAAP. The Company has not been
notified by any Governmental Entity or the Company's independent auditor, in
writing or otherwise, that such reserves are inadequate or that the practices
and policies of the Company in establishing its reserves for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and the three quarters ended September 30, 2004, and in
accounting for delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with
applicable accounting or regulatory requirements, or that such Governmental
Entity or the Company's independent auditor believes such reserves to be
inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of the Company.
The Company has previously furnished Parent with a complete list of all
extensions of credit and other real estate owned ("OREO") that have been
classified by any bank or trust examiner (regulatory or internal) as other loans
specially mentioned, special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss, classified or
criticized, credit risk assets, concerned loans or words of similar import. The
Company agrees to update such list no less frequently than monthly after the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date that
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. All OREO held by the
Company is being carried net of reserves at the lower of cost or net realizable
value.

     SECTION 3.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT. Except as set forth
on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") and making

being taken, Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

     the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate
     or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business
     as now being conducted except, as to Subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions
     where the failure to be duly organized, validly existing and in good
     standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent
     and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
     good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
     the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
     qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
     the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
     a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent is duly registered as a savings
     and loan holding company with the OTS under the HOLA, and Parent Bank is a
     Massachusetts chartered savings bank duly organized,



                                       38

     validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts.

     the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents,
     as amended to date of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

          (iii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Parent Disclosure
     Schedule, the minute books of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in all material
     respects, contain accurate records of all meetings and accurately reflect
     all other material actions taken by the stockholders of Parent and its
     Subsidiaries, the boards of directors of Parent and its Subsidiaries and
     all standing committees of the boards of directors of Parent and its
     Subsidiaries.

     (b) SUBSIDIARIES. Parent's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K included
in the Parent Filed SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.2(k)) lists all the
Subsidiaries of the Parent, whether consolidated or unconsolidated, required to
be listed therein in accordance with Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated by
the SEC. Except as set forth in said report, all outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary: (i) have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) are owned directly or
indirectly by Parent, free and clear of all Liens other than (A) Liens described
in Section 3.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule; (B) restrictions on
transferability pursuant to federal and state securities laws; and (C) Liens for
Taxes not yet due or delinquent or being contested in good faith and for which
reserves appropriate in all material respects have been established in
accordance with GAAP; and (iii) are free of any other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests) that would prevent the operation by the
Surviving Corporation of such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted. The
deposit accounts of the Parent Bank are insured by the FDIC through the BIF to
the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments required
in connection therewith have been paid by the Parent Bank.

     (c) CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
26,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("PARENT PREFERRED STOCK"). As of
the date of this Agreement: (i) 5,873,563 shares of Parent Common Stock were
issued and outstanding; (ii) 1,800,198 shares of Parent Common Stock were held
by Parent in its treasury; (iii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding or held by Parent in its treasury; (iv) 1,374,316 shares of
Parent Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to Parent's stock-based

equity-based compensation to any director, employee, consultant or independent
contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (such plans, collectively, the
"PARENT STOCK PLANS"), of which 641,685 shares are subject to outstanding
employee stock options or other rights to purchase or receive Parent Common
Stock granted under the Parent Stock Plans (collectively, "PARENT STOCK
OPTIONS"); and (v) no shares of Parent Common Stock are reserved for issuance
pursuant to securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Parent
Common Stock ("PARENT CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES"). All outstanding shares of

other ownership interests of Parent, (C) any warrants, calls, options or other
rights to acquire from Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and any obligation of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to issue, any capital stock, voting
securities or other ownership interests or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of other
ownership interests of Parent, and (y) there are no outstanding obligations of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, any such securities. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding (A) securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities
or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of Parent, (B) warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or
any obligation of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to issue, any capital
stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock, voting
securities or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of Parent or (C)
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such outstanding securities of Subsidiaries of Parent or
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party and, to the
knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, no other Person having beneficial
ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of 5% or more
of the outstanding Parent Common Stock (a "MAJOR PARENT STOCKHOLDER") is a
party, to any agreement restricting the transfer of, relating to the voting of,
requiring registration of, or granting any preemptive or antidilutive rights
with respect to any of the securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or, to the knowledge of Parent as of the
date hereof, any Major Parent Stockholder is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (d) AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION. Parent has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and stockholder action on
the part of Parent. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,
enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms except that (i) such
enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally
and (ii) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunction or
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would
be subject to the discretion of the courts for which any proceeding therefor may

respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (iii) and
(iv) only, any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens
that individually or in the aggregate would not (x) reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or (y) reasonably be expected to
materially impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, action by, or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with,

state securities or "blue sky" laws; (3) the approval of the OTS under the HOLA;
(4) the approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks; (5) the approval by the

     (e) PARENT DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

          (i) Since January 1, 2002, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries subject
     to reporting under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act have

     and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
     SEC Documents, and (ii) none of the Parent SEC Documents as of its date,

     state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
     to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
     they were made, not misleading, and no Parent SEC Document filed subsequent
     to the date hereof will contain as of its date, any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
     of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (ii) The financial statements of Parent and its consolidated
     Subsidiaries included in the Parent SEC Documents (including the related
     notes) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the
     SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
     the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
     been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
     statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
     basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
     thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
     financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
     dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
     flows for the periods then ended (subject in the case of unaudited
     statements, to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
     amount).

          (iii) Except (A) as reflected in Parent's unaudited balance sheet as
     of September 30, 2004 or liabilities described in any notes thereto (or
     liabilities for which neither accrual nor footnote disclosure is required

     business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2004 or in
     connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
     Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have any material
     liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued,
     contingent or otherwise.

          (iv) Parent's and its Subsidiaries' books and records fairly reflect
     in all material respects the transactions to which each of Parent and its
     Subsidiaries are a party or by which its or its Subsidiaries properties or
     assets are subject or bound. Such books and records have been properly kept
     and maintained and are in compliance with all applicable legal and
     accounting requirements.

     (h) TAX MATTERS.

          (i) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries has taken
     or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any action or knows of any
     fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be
     expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
     the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (ii) Each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has (A) timely filed
     (or there have been timely filed on its behalf) with the appropriate
     Governmental Entities all Tax Returns required to be filed by it (giving
     effect to all extensions) and such Tax Returns are true, correct and
     complete in all material respects; (B) timely paid in full (or there has
     been timely paid in full on its behalf) all material Taxes and (C) made
     adequate provision in all material respects (or adequate provision in all
     material respects has been made on its behalf) for all accrued Taxes not
     yet due. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in Parent's audited
     consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 (and the notes thereto)
     and the most recent quarterly financial statements (and the notes thereto)
     are adequate in all material respects to cover all Taxes accrued or
     accruable through the date thereof.

          (iii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
     notice of deficiency or assessment from any Governmental Entity for any
     amount of Tax that has not been fully settled or satisfied, and, to the
     knowledge of Parent and its Subsidiaries, no such deficiency or assessment
     is proposed.

     (i) LICENSES; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

          (i) Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective employees hold all
     material permits, licenses, variances, authorizations, exemptions, orders,
     registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities ("PARENT PERMITS")
     that are required for the operation of the respective businesses of Parent
     and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, except insofar as would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is, and for
     the last five years has been, in compliance with the terms of such Parent
     Permits and all such Parent Permits are in full force and effect and no
     suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the
     knowledge of Parent, threatened nor, to the knowledge of Parent, do grounds
     exist for any such action, except where non-compliance or such suspension,
     modification or revocation would not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (ii) Except where failure to comply would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
     Parent, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is, and for the last five years
     has been, in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws, regulations,
     ordinances, permits, rules, judgments, orders, decrees or arbitration
     awards of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or its Subsidiaries.



                                       43
<PAGE>


          (iii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
     outstanding order, injunction or decree or is a party to any written
     agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a
     party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or, is subject to
     any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any supervisory letter from
     or has adopted any resolutions at the request of any Governmental Entity
     that restricts in any respect the conduct of its business or, that in any
     manner currently relates to its capital adequacy, its policies, its
     management or its business (each, a "PARENT REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has
     Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (A) to its knowledge, been
     advised since January 1, 2002 by any Governmental Entity that it is
     considering issuing or requesting any Parent Regulatory Agreement or (B)
     have knowledge of any pending or threatened investigation by any
     Governmental Entity. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
     breach or default under any Parent Regulatory Agreement in any material
     respect.

          (iv) Except for filings with the SEC, which are the subject of Section
     3.2(e), since January 1, 2002, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have
     timely filed all regulatory reports, schedules, forms, registrations and
     other documents, together with any amendments required to be made with
     respect thereto, that they were required to file with any Governmental
     Entity (the "OTHER PARENT DOCUMENTS"), and have timely paid all fees and
     assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
     failure to make such payments and filings would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
     Parent. There is no material unresolved violation or exception by any of
     such Governmental Entities with respect to any report or statement relating
     to any examinations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (v) Since January 1, 2002, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
     nor to the knowledge of Parent any other Person acting on behalf of Parent
     or any of its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "financial institution"
     under the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws has knowingly acted, by itself or
     in conjunction with another, in any act in connection with the concealment
     of any Unlawful Gains, nor knowingly accepted, transported, stored, dealt
     in or brokered any sale, purchase or any transaction of other nature for
     Unlawful Gains except insofar as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
     Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "financial
     institution" under the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws has, during the past
     three years, implemented such anti-money laundry mechanisms and kept and
     filed all material reports and other necessary material documents as
     required by, and otherwise complied with, the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering
     laws and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, except insofar as
     would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
     result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (vi) The Parent Bank is "well-capitalized" and "well managed" under
     applicable regulatory definitions, and its examination rating under the
     Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is "satisfactory."

     (j) LITIGATION. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(j) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, no action, demand, charge, requirement or investigation by
any Governmental Entity and no litigation, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or arbitration by any Person or Governmental Entity, in each case
with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or Permits, is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     (k) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except for liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available
prior to the date hereof ("PARENT FILED SEC DOCUMENTS"), since September 30,
2004, (A) there has not been any Material Adverse Change in Parent or (B) there
are not, to Parent's knowledge, any facts, circumstances or events that make it
reasonably likely that Parent will not be able to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement in all material respects.

     (l) INTERNAL CONTROLS. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(l) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the records, systems, controls, data and information of
Parent and its respective Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following sentence. Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to
maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries; (3)
access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing assets
at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (1) has designed disclosure controls and
procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information relating to such entity and its
Subsidiaries is made known to the management of such entity (or its general
partner) by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required
by the Exchange Act with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and (2) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A)
any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have disclosed to its auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in its internal controls. Parent and its Subsidiaries have made available
to Company a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Parent's
auditors and audit committee since August 29, 2002. Parent



                                       45
<PAGE>


has initiated its process of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and expects to be in full compliance therewith by the SEC mandated
compliance date.

     (m) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

          (i) For purposes of this Section 3.2(m), "PARENT PLANS" shall mean its
     deferred compensation and each bonus of other incentive compensation, stock
     purchase, stock option and other equity compensation plan or program, or

     Section 3(2) of ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement

     its Subsidiaries or any executive officer thereof and each other employee
     benefit plan, fund or program, or arrangement applicable to identified
     groups of employees, in each case that is sponsored, maintained or
     contributed to or required to be contributed to by Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries is a party for the benefit of any current or former employee
     or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; each Parent Plan that is
     subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
     being the "PARENT TITLE IV PLANS."

          (ii) All contributions required to have been made with respect to any
     Parent Plan have been paid when due, except insofar as would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (iii) Each Parent Plan has been operated and administered in
     accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to
     ERISA and the Code, except insofar as the failure to do so would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.

          (iv) The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect
     to each Parent Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
     Section 401(a) of the Code that has not been revoked, and, to the knowledge
     of Parent, no circumstances exist that could adversely affect the qualified
     status of any such plan and the exemption under Section 501(a) of the Code
     of the trust maintained thereunder. Each Parent Plan intended to satisfy
     the requirements of Section 510(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such
     requirements in all material respects.

          (v) With respect to any Parent Title IV Plan to which Parent or any
     trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with Parent
     is a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (a
     "PARENT ERISA AFFILIATE") made, or was required to make, contributions on
     behalf of any current or former employee or director during the five (5)
     year period ending on the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior
     to the Closing Date, (a) no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of
     ERISA has been incurred by Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate that has
     not been satisfied in full, except where failure to satisfy such liability
     would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
     result in a Material Adverse



                                       46

     Effect on Parent, and (b) to the knowledge of Parent, no condition exists
     that presents a risk to Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate of incurring
     any such liability, other than liability for premiums due to the Pension
     Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due),
     except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (vi) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not, to the
     knowledge of Parent, instituted proceedings to terminate any Parent Title
     IV Plan and, to the knowledge of Parent, no condition exists that presents
     a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted, except insofar as
     would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
     a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No Parent Title IV Plan or any trust
     established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency"
     (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA of Section 412 of the Code), whether or
     not waived, as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal year,
     except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (vii) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
     or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Parent Plan by any employee or
     beneficiary covered under any such Parent Plan, or otherwise involving any
     such Parent Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except for
     claims which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     (n) INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, all Derivative Transactions entered into by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries were entered into in accordance with applicable rules,
regulations and policies of all regulatory authorities, and in accordance with
the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other Policies,
Practices and Procedures employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and were
entered into with counter parties believed at the time to be financially
responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their
advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions; and Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations under the
Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued, and, to Parent's knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations
or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

     (o) ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. There are no pending or threatened
Environmental Claims by any Person, or any conditions or circumstances that
could form the basis of any Environmental Claim, in each case seeking to impose
on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or that reasonably would be expected to
result in the imposition on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of, any liability
or obligation that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent arising under applicable common law standards relating to
pollution or protection of the environment, human health or safety, or under any
local, state or Federal environmental statute, regulation, ordinance, decree,
judgment or order relating to pollution or protection of the environment, human
health or safety including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.

Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), other than the transactions contemplated by

"CHANGE IN THE COMPANY RECOMMENDATION"), or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any
Company Takeover Proposal.

hours) provide a copy of any written request or Company Takeover Proposal to

Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.3 as
reasonable necessary to avoid violations thereof, and it is understood that any
violation of this Section 4.3 by any such Person, at the direction of or with
the consent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 4.3 by the Company.

     (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Company from
(x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) from making
such other disclosure as the Company is compelled to make under applicable law
(and in the event of any proposed disclosure under clause (y) the Company shall
consult in advance with Parent regarding the nature of and reasons for such
disclosure); provided, however, any such disclosure relating to a Company
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation
unless the Board of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure.

     SECTION 4.4 TRANSITION.

     (a) Commencing following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts
to facilitate the integration of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the
Company Bank, with the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by Parent. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date
and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the
continuous operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, the Company shall cause the Employees
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Company Bank, to
use their reasonable best efforts to provide support, including support from its
outside contractors, and to assist Parent in performing all tasks, including
equipment installation, reasonably required to result in a successful
integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined by Parent.

     (b) Parent and the Company agree to consult with respect to their loan,
litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) and the Company shall make such
modifications or changes to its policies and practices, if any, and at such date
prior to the Effective Time, as Parent shall reasonably request.



                                       55
<PAGE>


Parent and the Company shall also consult with respect to the character, amount
and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall take such charges as Parent
shall reasonably request. The Company shall not be required to take any action
required by this Section 4.4(b) (i) prior to the date on which all regulatory
and stockholder approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are received, (ii) until after receipt of written confirmation
from Parent that it is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would prevent
completion of the Merger, and (iii) if any such action is prohibited by GAAP or
any applicable laws and regulations. No party's representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or breached
in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes
to such policies and practices which may be undertaken on account of this
Section 4.4(b).

     SECTION 4.5 NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY PARENT.
Except (i) as set forth in Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii)
as consented to by the Company in writing or required by applicable law or
regulation or (iii) as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

          (i) except as contemplated hereby, amend its certificate of
     incorporation or bylaws in any manner that would adversely affect the
     economic benefits of the Merger to the holders of Company Common Stock;
     provided that the authorization or issuance of preferred stock in a manner
     that would not require Parent stockholder approval shall not be deemed to
     violate this clause (i);

          (ii) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any action
     which would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions of
     Article VI not being satisfied;

          (iii) knowingly take or cause to be taken any action which,
     individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent
     the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
     Code; or

          (iv) authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing
     actions or any other action that would be reasonably likely to prevent
     Parent from performing or would be reasonably likely to cause Parent not to
     perform its covenants hereunder in all material respects.

                                    ARTICLE V

reasonably requested by either Parent or the Company so that (i) the Form S-4
conforms in both form and substance to the requirements of the Securities Act,
and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement conforms in both form and substance to the
requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
holders of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock, respectively, as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective.

     (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any
event with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries, or
with respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement, such event shall be so described, and such amendment or
supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Company and Parent.

     (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate
government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other
appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any of the

contemplated hereby or for additional information and shall supply the other
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. The Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the
SEC with respect to the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and provide
to each other all information necessary in order to prepare the Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement, and shall provide promptly to the other party any
information such party may obtain that could necessitate amending any such
document.

     (d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, in accordance with the DGCL for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent Stockholder Approval,
respectively, and each shall coordinate with the other regarding the timing of
such meetings.

     (e) Subject to Section 4.3, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend to the Company's stockholders the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the
"COMPANY RECOMMENDATION"); provided, however, that the Company's Board of
Directors shall not be required to make such Company Recommendation to the
extent that it is permitted to effect a Change in the Company



                                       57
<PAGE>


Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.3. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 5.1(e) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company
Recommendation, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, this Agreement
and the Merger shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the
Merger and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
such obligation, provided, however, that if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have effected a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance
with this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to the Company's
stockholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to
the Company's stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Company's
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law.

     (f) The Board of Directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval and to recommend to Parent's
stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the "PARENT RECOMMENDATION").

Subsidiaries to, afford each other party and to the officers, Employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of each other
party, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time to all its respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each party shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to each other
party all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other party may reasonably request. In addition, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy
of each material report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it with any Governmental Entity and (b) the internal or external
reports prepared by it and/or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business that are reasonably required by Parent promptly after such reports are
made available to the Company's personnel. No review pursuant to this Section
5.2 shall affect any representation or warranty given by any party.

     (b) Each party shall continue to abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
Employees, agents and advisors (collectively, such party's "REPRESENTATIVES") to
treat all information and documents obtained from the other party or its
Representatives pursuant to Section 5.2(a) or during the investigations leading
up to the execution of this Agreement as "EVALUATION MATERIAL" (as that term is
used in the Confidentiality Agreement) subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii)

statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other

liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of

and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this

as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including



                                       59
<PAGE>


derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I and II of this
Agreement by each Company Insider to be exempt under Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Assuming that
the Company delivers to Parent the Company Section 16 Information (as defined
below) in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of Parent, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a
resolution providing in substance that the receipt by the Company Insiders (as
defined below) of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to the extent such
securities are listed in the Company Section 16 Information, are intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law. "COMPANY SECTION 16 INFORMATION"
shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Company
Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company
Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger.
"COMPANY INSIDERS" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who
are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company and, in with respect to the foregoing obligations of
Parent, who are listed in the Company Section 16 Information and who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
immediately following the Effective Time, with respect to Parent.

     SECTION 5.5 INDEMNIFICATION, EXCULPATION AND INSURANCE.

or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor

Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any existing indemnification
agreements or arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time.

     (b) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation in which any
individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts
to defend against and respond thereto.

maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage
and amount no less favorable to the Company's directors and officers currently
covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including self insurance) containing

coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(or to the extent not practicable, as soon as practicable and in any event

<PAGE>


such date), provided that no such representation or warranty of the Company
shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes hereunder as a consequence of
the existence of any fact, event or circumstance inconsistent with such
representation or warranty, unless such fact, event or circumstance,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty of the Company, has had or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the

the Effective Time, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
the tax opinion described in this Section 6.2(c), Wachtell, Lipton may require
and rely upon representations contained in certificates of officers of Parent
and the Company.

(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of
such date); and the Company shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing
Date, signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief

Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2
or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
party's failure to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to
Section 5.3.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, and whether before or after the Company Stockholder
Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval (the party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d) or (e) below shall give written
notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 8.2,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected):

     (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



                                       67
<PAGE>


     (b) by either Parent or the Company:

          (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the date that is
     ten months following the date hereof; provided, however, that the right to
     terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
     available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
     under this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated
     by such time;

          (ii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained
     at the Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
     adjournment or postponement thereof;

          (iii) if the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained
     at the Parent Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
     adjournment or postponement thereof;

          (iv) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section
     6.1(d) shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
     provided, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
     this Section 7.1(b)(iv) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent
     the entry of and to remove such Restraint; or

          (v) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
     Approval required to complete the Merger has denied the applicable
     Requisite Regulatory Approval and such denial has become final and
     nonappealable;

     (c) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have failed to make the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company shall have
effected a Change in the Company Recommendation or (iii) the Company shall have
breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to call or
convene the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1(e);

     (d) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by the
Company or is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof; or

     (e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Parent or
is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof.

     SECTION 7.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

     (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent or
the Company, other than that



                                       68
<PAGE>


the provisions of Section 5.2(b) shall survive such termination for a period of
two years thereafter and the provisions of Section 5.6, this Section 7.2 and
Article VIII shall survive such termination indefinitely or otherwise in
accordance with their terms, provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

     (b) (i) In the event that (A) a Company Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event (as defined below) shall occur after the date of this Agreement and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(b)(ii) as a result of a failure to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d) and (B) prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of
such termination the Company consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or enters
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (each, a "COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to any
Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall on the earlier of (i) the date
such Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into or (ii) the date such Company
Takeover Proposal is consummated pay Parent a fee equal to $6,000,000 by wire
transfer of same day funds.

         (ii) For purposes of this Section 7.2(b), a "PRE-TERMINATION TAKEOVER
PROPOSAL EVENT" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to
the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been made known to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or has been
made directly to its stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover
Proposal, and such Company Takeover Proposal or public announcement shall not
have been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five Business Days prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay
the amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company
for the fee set forth in this Section 7.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent
its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on
six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

     SECTION 7.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent Stockholder
Approval; provided, however, that after such approval, there shall not be made
any amendment that by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company and Parent without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of all of the parties.

     SECTION 7.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.3, waive compliance by the other party with any of the



                                       69
<PAGE>


agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part
of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                                   ARTICLE VIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     SECTION 8.1 NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, and shall expire at
the Effective Time and be of no further effect thereafter. This Section 8.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

     SECTION 8.2 NOTICES. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed

Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.
24 North Street
Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201


Attention:  General Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Woronoco
Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), as that term is defined
in Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES Act"). I
understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of December 16, 2004 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and between Berkshire Hills
Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), and the Company, the Company
plans to merge with and into Parent (the "MERGER") with Parent being the
surviving corporation. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

      I further understand that, as a result of the Merger, in exchange for
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY
COMMON STOCK") I may receive common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
("PARENT COMMON STOCK").

      I have read this letter and discussed the requirements hereof to the
extent I felt necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

      I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I
receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

      1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such
Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), (iii) in the
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or
under a "no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC,
such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Securities Act, or (iv) I have the right to have the
legend set forth in Sections 3 and 4 below removed pursuant to Section 4 below.

      2. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under
the Securities Act or,



                                       A-1
<PAGE>


other than as set forth below, to take any other action necessary in order to
make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

      3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's
transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result
of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates, if any, for
such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

           "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
           TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
           1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE
           TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A LETTER AGREEMENT
           BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP,
           INC., A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES
           OF BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP, INC."

      4. I understand that, unless the transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock
issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities
Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d)
under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
place the following legend on the certificates, if any, issued to my transferee:

           "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
           UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
           RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 UNDER THE
           SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
           TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
           REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM
           THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF, THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

      It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3)
and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without
such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be lifted (A) if one year
(or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) or any successor
thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) (or any successor
thereto) are then available to me, (B) if two years (or such other period as may
be required by Rule 145(d)(3) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from
the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) (or any successor thereto) are then available to me
or (C) if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no-action" letter or
interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) a written
statement from me representing that that the Parent Common Stock represented by
such certificates are being or have been sold in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145(d) or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act.



                                       A-2

      Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part
of "affiliate" status as described in the first paragraph of this letter
agreement, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I
am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

      By acceptance hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the
Effective Time that, so long as it is obligated to file reports pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that it
will use its reasonable best efforts to timely file such reports so that the
public information requirements of Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities
Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) are
therefore available to me if I desire to transfer Parent Common Stock issued to
me in the Merger.


                                    Very truly yours,


                                    By: _______________________
