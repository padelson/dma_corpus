ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to _Section
7.01_, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent
to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex II_ (as they
may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_
"), and not any other conditions. The Offer shall initially expire at 11:59
p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the right to
waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Sub to, (i) reduce the
number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii)
amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the Offer
Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner
adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock, (v) except as expressly
provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_, terminate, extend or otherwise
amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer (or take any other action
that would have the effect of extending the expiration date of the Offer),
(vi) change the form of consideration

 



2  payable in the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the
terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock
or (viii) provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Subject to the partiesÂ’ rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and SubÂ’s right to waive
any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition), Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (or such longer period
as the parties may agree) each, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the
Offer, any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such
time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or waived and (ii)
extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sub shall not be required to, and
without the CompanyÂ’s prior written consent shall not, extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date or the date of a valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (x)
immediately following any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (if each
Offer Condition shall have been satisfied or, if permitted by this Agreement,
waived at such time) irrevocably accept for payment all Shares that Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer ( _provided_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, if the date of such expiration is the Outside Date,
such acceptance shall occur on the Outside Date) (such acceptance, the "
_Offer Closing_ ") and (y) following such acceptance, and no later than as
soon as practicable on the Business Day that immediately follows the date on
which the Offer expired, pay for all such Shares. The date and time at which
the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance
Time_." The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such
expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7_ _.01_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7_ _.01_ , then Sub shall promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7_
_.01_ , Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which
shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares as, and to the extent, required by
applicable federal securities Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Sub all information concerning the Company that is required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or as otherwise reasonably
requested by Parent. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, Parent and Sub shall provide the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response and Parent and

 



3  Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the
Company. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as
so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any
request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between Parent, Sub and their respective representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand (and
shall orally describe any oral comments). Parent and Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Offer Documents.

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to Sub, on a timely basis,
all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer; provided, that in no way shall this
_Section 1.01(c)_ reduce, offset or limit the obligations of Parent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders
of Shares tendered in the Offer the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company has not been advised that any of its directors or named
executive officers (as that term is defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K of
the Securities Act) who are executive officers of the Company as of the date
hereof who own Shares do not intend to tender such Shares pursuant to the
Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries (other than Shares held on behalf of third parties) will be
tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(b) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or as soon
as practicable (but in any event within one Business Day) thereafter, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/ Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule  14D-9_"),
which shall, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.03_: reflect the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, describe and make the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Offer (provided that there has not been a
Change of Company Recommendation in accordance with

 



4   _Section 5.03_) and include the notice of appraisal rights in the Merger
to the holders of Shares required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
shall set the record date for the CompanyÂ’s stockholders to receive such
notice of appraisal as the same date as the Stockholder List Date and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 including such notice of appraisal to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders to the extent required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or
otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares. Parent and Sub shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub that is
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or as
otherwise reasonably requested by the Company. Prior to the filing of
the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response and the Company shall give reasonable
consideration to any comments provided by Parent. Each of the Company, Parent
and Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments
or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and the Company Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand
(and shall orally describe any oral comments). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to furnish Sub promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date of execution of this Agreement by all parties)
with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders
of Shares as of the most recent practicable date, together, to the extent
reasonably available, with copies of lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files in the CompanyÂ’s possession or control regarding
the beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to Sub such information
(including, to the extent reasonably available, updated lists of record
holders and stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as
Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of
Shares. The date of the list used to determine the persons to whom the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated is referred to as the
" _Stockholder List Date_." Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and
Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose such information, including the
information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files, in each
case as required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information
only (and shall not disclose any such information except) in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,
upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



5 Section 1.03 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving

all the rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with
Section 259 of the DGCL. The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section

the first Business Day following the date of and as soon as practicable

Agreement by such date, the Closing shall occur on the first Business Day
on which the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ shall be satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Agreement. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the

date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as

formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest
thereon, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2_ _.05_.

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company and all Shares owned of
record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with
respect thereto.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Offer Price
and the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC or another U.S.-based nationally
recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the

 



7  holders of Shares to receive the funds to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of
_Section 1.01(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_, deposit with the Paying
Agent, in immediately available funds, a cash amount equal to the sum of the
Aggregate Offer Consideration plus the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
(the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be held in trust by the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares that Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and for the benefit of the holders
of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2_ _.02_ , Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying
Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1
or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s
Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of
Shares pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_;
_provided_ , that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the
payments required by _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Article II_ , and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent, to be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as
funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Section 2.02_. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as
Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange
Fund for the benefit of the former holders of Shares and to make payments from
the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Section
2.02_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, except
as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time and in any event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent), and shall otherwise be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, subject
to the reasonable consent of the Company; and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
in proper form, with respect to such Certificate, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of
the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)(i)_ (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
2_ _.05)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and

 



8  Merger Consideration may be issued to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not required to be paid. Each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall, without further action (except, in the case of Shares
held via a depository, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of any customary
transmission or materials required by the Paying Agent), be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver, promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event more
than two (2) Business Days thereafter), payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2_ _.05)_ to be made to the person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.02(e)_) or in respect of any Book- Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to any Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares
and compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_,
without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and Parent) of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the
Aggregate

 



9  Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate may be required, as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, to provide a bond in a customary amount if so required
by the policies and procedures of the Paying Agent.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Restricted Stock, Performance-Based Restricted
Stock and Equity Plans_. 

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of Shares subject to forfeiture
restrictions or other restrictions (such stock that is not Performance-
Based Restricted Stock, " _Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to a Company
Stock Plan shall vest in full and all restrictions (including forfeiture
restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Shares shall lapse.

 

(b) _Treatment of Performance-Based Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the CompanyÂ’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Shares subject to
forfeiture restrictions or other restrictions that are performance-based ("
_Performance-Based Restricted Stock_ ") and granted pursuant to a Company
Stock Plan shall be vested assuming all applicable performance measures are
satisfied at target levels and all restrictions (including forfeiture
restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Shares shall lapse and any
Shares not vested pursuant to the foregoing shall be cancelled and forfeited.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Performance-Based
Restricted Stock for which the applicable performance cycle has ended prior
to the Effective Time but with respect to which a determination with respect
to the actual achievement of performance measures has not been made as of the
Effective Time, no later than immediately prior to the Closing, the
compensation committee of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors shall make a
determination of the actual achievement of performance measures applicable to
such Performance-Based Restricted Stock in good faith using all
applicable data which is reasonably available to the compensation committee
of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors at such time and, in each case, in
accordance with past practice, shall determine the degree to which such
Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall be vested and all restrictions
(including forfeiture restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Shares
shall lapse and any Shares not vested pursuant to the foregoing shall be
cancelled and forfeited; _provided_ , however, that any such Performance-
Based Restricted Stock shall in no event vest at greater than target levels.

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and no further Restricted Stock,
Performance-Based Restricted Stock or other rights with respect to Shares
shall be granted thereunder.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
have taken (or cause the Company Board to use reasonable efforts to have been
taken, as the case may be) such actions as may be necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 



10 (e) _Parent Funding_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the
payments required under this _Section 2.03_ as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation
and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.

 

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL
concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such Shares
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_, but shall
become the right to receive the fair value of such Shares pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws such Dissenting StockholderÂ’s demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting StockholderÂ’s right of
appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, such
Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest and
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2_ _.05_. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on the Company
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted and withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, including in respect of the Shares vested or cancelled in the
Merger, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions or other
actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

cease and terminate any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
persons that may be ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal or
any inquiries, proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Competing Proposal and shall promptly request the return from, or the
destruction by, all such persons of all non-public information previously
furnished or made available to such persons by or on behalf of the Company in
connection therewith (and, upon becoming aware of noncompliance with such a
request that is inconsistent with the terms of an applicable confidentiality
agreement with such third party, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
ensure that such requests are complied with) and (ii) from and after the date
hereof until the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
the respective directors and officers of the Company and each wholly owned
Company Subsidiary, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Other
Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit
or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal, (B) furnish any non-public information
regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person in
connection with or in response to any inquiries, proposals or offers
that constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, Competing
Proposal, (C) enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any third person relating to any inquiries, proposals or
offers that constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Proposal or (D) amend or grant any waiver or release under or fail
to use reasonable efforts to enforce any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any Equity Interests of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
entered into in respect of, in contemplation of or otherwise relating to a
Competing Proposal, except to permit the making of a confidential Competing
Proposal to the CompanyÂ’s board of directors if the CompanyÂ’s board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failing to waive or release such provision to permit the making
of a confidential Competing Proposal to the CompanyÂ’s board of directors
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law.

 



36 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.03(a)_ but subject (as applicable) to the rest
of this  _Section 5.03_, if, at any time following the date hereof and prior
to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a bona fide written
Competing Proposal from a person that did not result from a breach (other than
breaches of the timing requirements in _Section 5.03(a)_ that are immaterial
in nature and effect) of this _Section 5.03_ by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the respective directors and officers of the Company and each
wholly owned Company Subsidiary or the Other Company Representatives (as if,
for purposes of this clause only, all such Other Company Representatives were
bound directly by the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ _ 5.03_) and
(ii) the CompanyÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that failing to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, then
the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing Proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such
Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not,
and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not
to, disclose any non-public information regarding the Company to such person
without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
person; (y) will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours thereafter) notify
Parent in writing of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, which such
notification shall identify the person making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Competing Proposal and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of (and in any event within 48 hours following) any material changes
to such Competing Proposal, and shall promptly (and in any event within 48
hours after receipt) provide to Parent, an unredacted copy of such Competing
Proposal if made in writing (or a written summary of the material terms of
such Competing Proposal if not made in writing), any relevant proposed
material transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments
(including redacted fee letters) and (z) will as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 48 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any material
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or
made available to such other person (or its representatives) making a
Competing Proposal that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. None of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Representatives from contacting any person or group of persons that has made a
Competing Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
breach of _Section 5.03(a)_ solely to request the clarification of the terms
and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Competing Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and any such actions shall not be a breach of this _Section 5.03_.

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ or _Section 5.03(e)_, neither
the CompanyÂ’s board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt,
authorize, approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt,
authorize, approve, endorse or recommend, or submit to the vote of any
stockholders of the Company, any Competing Proposal, (ii) fail to make,
withhold, qualify, modify or amend, or propose publicly to fail to make,
withhold, qualify, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, (any action set forth in the

 



37  foregoing _clauses (i)_ __ through _(iii)_ , a " _Change of Company
Recommendation_ "), (iv) if a tender offer or exchange offer for Shares that
constitutes a Competing Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company (including for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of
the Company, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten Business Days after
commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, (v) allow
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any

requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions or (vi) approve any person becoming an "interested stockholder"
under Section 203 of the DGCL.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 5.03(c)_ but subject (as applicable) to the
rest of _Section 5.03_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors may make a Change of Company Recommendation in
response to a Competing Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to and
in accordance with _Section 7.01(f)_ in order to enter into a definitive
written acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if and only
if:

 

(i) (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of _Section
5.03(a)_ (other than breaches of the timing requirements in _Section
5.03(a)_ that are immaterial in nature and effect)) is made to the Company by
a third person and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failing to effect a Change
of Company Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

(ii) the Company provided Parent prior written notice of the CompanyÂ’s
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.01(f)_ (a " _Notice
of Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall include the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery
of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(iii) the Company has negotiated in good faith, and has directed any
applicable Company Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with
Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent for at least four (4) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two (2) Business Day
period from the date of such notice); and

 



38 (iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company during such four (4) Business Day period or two (2)
Business Day period, as applicable, the CompanyÂ’s board of directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that (A) such Competing Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes proposed by Parent were to be
given effect and (B) failing to effect a Change of Company Recommendation
would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.03(c)_ but subject (as applicable) to the
rest of _Section 5.03_, other than in connection with a Superior Proposal
(which shall be subject to _Section 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors may make a Change of Company Recommendation in
response to an Intervening Event if:

 

(i) the CompanyÂ’s board of directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Intervening Event, failing to make a Change of Company
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 

(ii) the Company provides Parent a Notice of Change of Recommendation, which
notice shall describe the Intervening Event (it being agreed that the
delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company shall not,
in and of itself, constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(iii) the Company has negotiated in good faith, and has directed any
applicable Company Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with
Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent for at least four (4) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation; and

 

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company during such four (4) Business Day period, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failing to make a
Change of Company Recommendation would continue to reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the CompanyÂ’s
board of directors from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the CompanyÂ’s board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (for the avoidance of
doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or the announcement by the CompanyÂ’s
board of directors that it is in receipt of a Competing Proposal, shall not
(in and of itself) constitute a Change of Company Recommendation); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company and the CompanyÂ’s board of directors may not
effect a Change of Company Recommendation except as permitted by _Section
5.03(d)_ or _Section 5.03(e)_.

 



39 Section 5.04 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to:
(a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (b)
furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as
Parent or its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company
Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent
that the Company believes in good faith that doing so would: (i) result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate
any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party (provided
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in such a breach,
contravention or violation and (B) if requested by Parent, seek the waiver
of such persons to allow for such access or disclosure) or otherwise result
in the Company taking any action inconsistent with _Section 5.03_; or (iii)
breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law). During any visit to the business or property sites of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall,
and shall cause their respective representatives accessing such properties to,
comply with all applicable Laws and all of the CompanyÂ’s and the Company
SubsidiariesÂ’ safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 5.04_, from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates
shall conduct, without the prior written consent of the Company, at any real
property owned or leased by the Company, any "Phase II" or similar
environmental investigation, including any sampling or other intrusive
investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or any other
environmental media at or in connection with any of such real property. Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives, to hold all information provided or furnished pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.05 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03_ , each of Parent and the Company shall (and the
Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and Parent shall cause each of
its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Transactions and to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ and _Annex
II_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of ParentÂ’s or SubÂ’s affiliates
to) and the Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to) use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or
nonactions, consents, Permits (including Environmental Permits), waivers,
approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental Entities or other
persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions,
(ii) as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, make and not withdraw (without the
CompanyÂ’s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
all 

 



40  registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity or other persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including
the filings required of the parties or their "ultimate parent entities" under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and promptly make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable, (iii) defend all lawsuits
or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other Proceedings to which it
or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a
final, non-appealable order with respect to each such lawsuit or other
Proceeding, (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to
consummate the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-
appealable order with respect thereto, (v) seek to resolve any objection or
assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the
Transactions and (vi) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.05_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding, each party hereto
will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation
or legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have final approval over matters
pertaining to any such request, inquiry, investigation, or legal Proceeding
relating to competition or antitrust Laws.

 

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be a joint press release, and thereafter, except with respect to any public
statement by the Company or Parent with respect to any Change of Company
Recommendation, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

 

Section 5.07 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each
fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the 

 



41  Company Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the
extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or
performed services at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to
the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the Transactions,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such personÂ’s rights under this 
_Section 5.07_. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or
liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification
under Law).

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought
before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the CompanyÂ’s existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of
such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the CompanyÂ’s existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the premium paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any such "tail" policy, or the annual premium in
the event a "tail" policy is not obtained, shall not exceed 300% of the
current premium for the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy (it being understood that if the premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount).

 



42 (c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_.

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the equivalent
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary.

 

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified PartyÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified
PartyÂ’s representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in
a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their
successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.07_, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.07_ is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

 

Section 5.08 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Transactions and (b) if any
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the
Transactions, to take all action necessary so that such Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent
practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transaction. 

Section 5.09 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the date that
is six months after the Effective Time, or if earlier, upon the termination
of employment of the relevant employee, Parent shall provide or cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide base salary,
wages, benefit programs (other than defined benefit pension, nonqualified or
deferred compensation, equity or equity-based or retiree welfare benefits)
and commission opportunities to all employees of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue their
employment with the Company or any Company

 



43  Subsidiary immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") that are, in the aggregate for all such employees,
substantially comparable to the base salary, wages, benefit programs (other
than defined benefit pension, nonqualified or deferred compensation, equity or
equity-based or retiree welfare benefits) and commission opportunities
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and Sub; provided,
however, that with respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated prior to the date that is six months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide severance benefits to such Continuing Employee that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided under any severance
plan, policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue the Landauer Executive Special
Severance Plan in accordance with its terms as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to the amounts payable under the CompanyÂ’s annual cash
incentive program for the year ending September 30, 2017 (collectively, the "
_2017 Bonuses_ "), if the Closing Date occurs prior to the determination of
actual satisfaction of the applicable performance measures in accordance with
past practice, no later than immediately prior to the Closing, the
compensation committee of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors shall make a
determination of the actual achievement of performance measures under such
program in good faith using all applicable data which is reasonably available
to the compensation committee of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors at such time
and shall determine the amount of each 2017 Bonus; provided, however, that the
aggregate amount of all 2017 Bonuses shall not exceed the amount set forth on
_Section 5.09(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the 2017 Bonuses are
not paid to the applicable employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the 2017 Bonuses to such employees in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, at such time, and subject to such conditions,
as set forth in the CompanyÂ’s annual cash incentive program for the year
ending September 30, 2017. If the Closing Date occurs on or after October 1,
2017, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each employee
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who, as determined by Parent, is
eligible to participate in the CompanyÂ’s annual cash incentive program for the
CompanyÂ’s fiscal year commencing October 1, 2017 (the " _2018 Bonus
Plan Participants_ "), a bonus in respect of the period commencing on October
1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017, an amount equal to the product of (i)
the 2018 Bonus Plan ParticipantÂ’s 2017 target bonus, and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is 92 and the denominator of which is 365 (the bonuses
payable to 2018 Bonus Plan Participants, collectively, the " _2018 Bonuses_
"). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the 2018 Bonuses at
such time as Parent pays annual bonuses to other employees of Parent for
ParentÂ’s 2017 bonus year (on or about March 2018, but in all events during
2018), subject to the applicable 2018 Bonus Plan ParticipantÂ’s continued
employment with the Surviving Corporation or Company Subsidiaries through
December 31, 2017.

 



44 (c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and with respect to
any 401(k), paid time off, vacation, and severance plan only, benefit
accruals (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen
benefit plan of Parent or any of its affiliates or vesting under any equity
incentive plan) under any employee benefit plans sponsored and maintained by
Parent or any affiliate of Parent in which the Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date (the " _Parent Plans_ "),
Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service
with the Company and its affiliates before the Effective Time, to the same
extent and for the same purposes as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of compensation or benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

(d) Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to waive, or cause to be waived, any waiting periods under any Parent Plans
providing welfare benefits maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate that replace a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs or the immediately following plan year, except to the extent that such
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
(or, with respect to any insured arrangement, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts), or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to (or, with respect to any insured arrangement, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, and actively at work requirements
under any Parent Plans providing welfare benefits maintained by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
that replace a comparable Company Benefit Plan in the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs or the immediately following plan year, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, and
actively-at-work requirements would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to a Parent Plan providing health benefits that replaces a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs or the immediately following plan year, Parent shall (or, with respect
to any insured arrangement, shall use commercially reasonable efforts), or
shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to (or,
with respect to any insured arrangement, use commercially reasonable efforts
to) recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs (or the immediately following plan year if
applicable ) for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment
limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the relevant Parent Plans
providing health benefits in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents)
will be eligible to participate in the calendar year in which a
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in such Parent Plan,
except to the extent that such credit for co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses paid did not apply under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in
effect at the time such expense was incurred.

(e) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to
the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company Board will adopt
(and will cause any other plan sponsor of the applicable Company Benefit Plan
to adopt), at least five (5) business days prior to the initial scheduled
expiration of the Offer, resolutions terminating, effective as of the day

 



45  immediately preceding the Closing Date (and contingent upon the Closing
becoming effective), all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code with a cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "). Upon a
distribution of each applicable Continuing EmployeeÂ’s account balances under
the Company 401(k) Plans, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, permit such Continuing Employees to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash, but
excluding the ability to rollover existing loans, from the Company 401(k) Plan
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e) _of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _

arrangement, (ii) create any rights or remedies of any nature, including any
third-party beneficiary rights in any person (other than the parties to this
Agreement) in any respect, including in respect of continued employment or
service (or resumed employment or service) or any term or condition of
employment or service, or create any such rights in any such persons in
respect of any compensation or benefits that may be provided, (iii) prohibit
or limit the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates (and post-closing
including the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, or (iv) obligate Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A) maintain any

compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement, or
(B) retain the employment or service of any particular employee or service

compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements entered into on or
after the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the

 



46  Company or its subsidiaries, in each case under which any such person could
become entitled to (i) any additional compensation, enhanced severance or
other benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
compensation, severance or other benefits or any funding of any compensation
or benefits by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as a result of
the Offer or (ii) any other compensation or benefits from the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries related to or contingent upon or the value of
which would be calculated on the basis of the Offer, and (b) to ensure that
any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered

hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other
parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,

other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the

this sentence shall be entitled to enforce their rights under this Agreement.
The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries
under _clauses (a)_ __ and _(b)_ of the preceding sentence shall not arise

hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 7.04_ without notice or liability to any
other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If

vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and

rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As
used in this Agreement, the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or theory extends and such phrase shall not
mean "if." The term "made available" and words of similar import, when used

Day. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references
in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein"

 



53  and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. In this Agreement, references to "as of the date of this
Agreement," "as of the date hereof" or words of similar import shall be deemed
to mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 

Section 8.08 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described in this
Agreement. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided in this
Agreement shall constitute sufficient service of process, and the parties
further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts in Delaware as described in this Agreement for any reason, (ii) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the
Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, 

 



54  (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Sub at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may

FORM OF AGREEMENT TO TENDER

 

TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 6, 2017, is by and among FORTIVE CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), FERN MERGER SUB INC., a Delaware corporation and
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and the entity set
forth on _Schedule A_ hereto (the " _Shareholder_ "), solely in its capacity
as a shareholder of the Company.

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the beneficial owner (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the number of shares of
common stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _Common Stock_ "), of Landauer,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), set forth opposite the
ShareholderÂ’s name on _Schedule A_ (all such shares set forth on _Schedule A_
, together with any Shares that are hereafter issued to or otherwise
acquired or owned by the Shareholder prior to the termination of this
Agreement being referred to herein as the " _Subject Shares_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof and as it may be amended from time to
time (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which provides, among other things, for Sub
to commence a tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding Shares (the "
_Offer_ ") and the merger of the Company and Sub (the " _Merger_ "), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement
(capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement); and

WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent and Sub have required that the Shareholder, and as an
inducement and in consideration therefor, the Shareholder (in the
ShareholderÂ’s capacity as a holder of the Subject Shares) has agreed to, enter
into this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

AGREEMENT TO TENDER

1.1 _Agreement to Tender_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the
Shareholder agrees to validly tender or cause to be tendered in the Offer all
of the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares owned by the Shareholder as of the date of
such tender (the "Tender Date") pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of the Offer, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than any applicable
restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than
(10) Business Days after, the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Offer, the Shareholder shall (i)
deliver pursuant to the terms of the Offer (A) if the ShareholderÂ’s Subject
Shares are certificated, a letter of transmittal with respect to such Subject
Shares complying with the terms of the Offer and Certificate(s) representing
such Subject Shares (or deliver an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and (B)
all other documents or instruments required to be delivered by all other
Company shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Offer, or (ii) cause the
ShareholderÂ’s broker or such other Person that is the holder of record of any
such Subject Shares beneficially owned by the Shareholder to tender such
Subject Shares pursuant to and in accordance with clause (i) of this _Section
1.1_ and the terms of the Offer. If the Shareholder acquires any Subject
Shares after the Tender Date, the Shareholder shall tender into the Offer
such Subject Shares prior to the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days
following the date that the Shareholder shall acquire such Subject Shares and
(y) the expiration date of the Offer. The Shareholder agrees that, once the
ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares are tendered, the Shareholder will not withdraw
any of such Subject Shares from the Offer, unless and until (A) the Offer
shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or (B) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn, or the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the
purchase of the Subject Shares in the Offer, Parent shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository to return, all the Subject Shares tendered by the
Shareholder in the Offer.

 

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SHAREHOLDER

 

The Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that:

 

2.1. _Authorization; Binding Agreement_. The Shareholder is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated or constituted (to the extent such concepts are
recognized in such jurisdiction) and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby are within the ShareholderÂ’s corporate or
organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or organizational actions on the part of the Shareholder and (b) the
Shareholder has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Shareholder, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Shareholder enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity
governing the availability of equitable remedies (collectively, the

2.2. _Non-Contravention_. None of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by the Shareholder or the consummation by the Shareholder of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the ShareholderÂ’s organizational documents, or (ii) except as may
be required by federal securities law, require any consent or approval under,
violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss of any

 



2 benefit under, or constitute a default under (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), or result in termination or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Subject Shares pursuant to,
any Contract, order or other instrument binding on the Shareholder, except,
in each case, for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise adversely impact the ShareholderÂ’s ability to
perform its obligations hereunder.

2.3. _Ownership of Subject Shares; Total Shares_. The Shareholder is the
record or beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act)
of the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares and has good and marketable title to such

natural persons listed on Schedule A thereto and their Affiliates (as defined
therein) or (b) pursuant to any applicable restrictions on transfer under the
Securities Act. The Subject Shares listed on _Schedule A_ opposite the

respect to the matters set forth herein and full power to agree to all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of the
ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares. None of the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares are
subject to any proxy, voting trust or other agreement or arrangement
with respect to the voting of such Subject Shares, except as provided
hereunder or in the Support Agreement.

2.5. _Reliance_. The Shareholder has had the opportunity to review the Merger
Agreement and this Agreement with counsel of the ShareholderÂ’s own choosing.

into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the ShareholderÂ’s execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement.

2.6 _Absence of Litigation_. With respect to the Shareholder, as of the date
hereof, there is no Proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of the
Shareholder, threatened against the Shareholder or any of the ShareholderÂ’s
properties or assets (including the Subject Shares) that could reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation by the
Shareholder of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
adversely impact the ShareholderÂ’s ability to perform its obligations
hereunder.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE SHAREHOLDER

The Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that until the termination of this
Agreement:

 

4.1. _Voting of Subject Shares; Proxy_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the time this Agreement is
in effect, at every annual or special meeting of the CompanyÂ’s shareholders
called, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, the Shareholder
shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to,
include the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares in any computation for purposes of
establishing a quorum at any such meeting of CompanyÂ’s shareholders and vote
the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares (to the extent that any of the Subject Shares

for a vote at such meeting) (the " _Vote Shares_ ") (i) in favor of (A)
approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder
and (B) approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a
later date, if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the Merger
Agreement or such other transaction on the date on which such meeting is held
and (ii), to the extent it is submitted for a vote at such meeting,
against (A) any Competing Proposal or (B) any action, proposal, transaction
or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in the occurrence of
any condition set forth in Annex II to the Merger Agreement or result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of the Shareholder under this Agreement (including any proposal to
change in any manner the voting rights of the Subject Shares).

 



4 Subject to the foregoing, the Shareholder shall retain at all times the right
to vote the Subject Shares in the ShareholderÂ’s sole discretion, and without
any other limitation, on any matters other than those set forth herein that
are at any time or from time to time presented for consideration to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders generally.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the time this Agreement is
in effect, the Shareholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent
and any senior executive officer thereof, the ShareholderÂ’s proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place
and stead of the Shareholder, to attend any meeting of the CompanyÂ’s
shareholders on behalf of the Shareholder with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 4.1(a), to include such Subject Shares in any computation for
purposes of establishing a quorum at any such meeting of CompanyÂ’s
shareholders, and to vote all Vote Shares, or to grant a consent or approval
in respect of the Vote Shares, in connection with any meeting of CompanyÂ’s
shareholders or any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting of
CompanyÂ’s shareholders in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section
4.1(a), in each case, in the event that (i) the Shareholder fails to comply
with the obligations of the Shareholder set forth in Section 4.1(a) above,
(ii) any Proceeding is commenced, or order entered, which challenges or
impairs the enforceability or validity of the obligations of the Shareholder
set forth in Section 4.1(a) or (iii) Parent notifies the Shareholder of
its intent to exercise the proxy set forth in this Section 4.1(b). The
Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 4.1(b) is given in connection with the execution of the Merger
Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance
of the duties of the Shareholder under this Agreement. The Shareholder hereby
further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and,
except as set forth in this Section or in Section 5.2 hereof, is intended to
be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 211(e) of the
DGCL.

4.2. _No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_. Except as provided
hereunder (including pursuant to Section 1.1 or Section 4.1) or under the
Merger Agreement and until this Agreement is terminated, the Shareholder shall
not, directly or indirectly, (i) create or permit to exist any Encumbrance,
other than pursuant to any applicable restrictions on transfer under the
Securities Act, on any such Subject Shares, (ii) transfer, sell, assign, gift,
hedge, pledge or otherwise dispose (whether by sale, liquidation,
dissolution, dividend or distribution) of, or enter into any derivative
arrangement with respect to (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), any or all of the
ShareholderÂ’s Equity Interests in the Company, including any Subject Shares,
or any right or interest therein (or consent to any of the foregoing), (iii)
enter into any contract, option or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any Transfer of such Subject Shares or any
interest therein, (iv) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-
attorney or other authorization or consent in or with respect to any such
Subject Shares, (v) deposit or permit the deposit any of the ShareholderÂ’s
Equity Interests in the Company, including any Subject Shares, into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of
such Equity Interests, including the Subject Shares, or (vi) take or permit
any other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of the ShareholderÂ’s obligations hereunder or the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise make any representation or warranty of the
Shareholder herein untrue or incorrect. Any action taken in violation of the
foregoing sentence shall be null and void ab initio and the Shareholder agrees
that any such prohibited action may and should be enjoined. If any
involuntary Transfer of any of the Subject Shares shall occur (including, but
not limited to, a sale by the ShareholderÂ’s trustee in any

 



5 bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any creditorÂ’s or court sale), the
transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees
and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such
Subject Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights
under this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until
valid termination of this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, the
Shareholder agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates
not to, become a member of a "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) with respect to any Equity Interests in the Company for the
purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder may make Transfers of Subject Shares (a) to any
affiliate of the Shareholder, in which case the Subject Shares shall continue
to be bound by this Agreement and provided that any such transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to
the consummation of any such Transfer; or (b) as Parent may otherwise agree in
writing in its sole discretion.

 

4.3. _No Exercise of Appraisal Rights; Actions_. The Shareholder (i) waives
and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or dissentersÂ’ rights in
respect of the ShareholderÂ’s Subject Shares that may arise with respect to the
Merger and (ii) agrees not to commence or join in, and agrees to take all
actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect
to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, Sub, the Company or
any of their respective successors challenging the validity of, or seeking to
enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement. For
clarity, nothing in this Section 4.3 shall limit the rights of the
Shareholder or its representatives to indemnification, exculpation or
advancement of expenses under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any provision of the
Merger Agreement or related agreement.

4.4. _Documentation and Information_. Except as required by applicable law
(including without limitation the filing of a Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G or
amendment thereto, as applicable, with the SEC which may include this
Agreement as an exhibit thereto), the Shareholder shall not make any public
announcement regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, however, that such
consent shall not be required to the extent that any such announcement is
consistent with the prior public announcements made by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Shareholder consents to and hereby
authorizes Parent and Sub to publish and disclose in all documents and
schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure
document that Parent or Sub reasonably determines to be necessary in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and any transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, the ShareholderÂ’s identity and ownership of the Subject
Shares, the existence of this Agreement and the nature of the ShareholderÂ’s
commitments and obligations under this Agreement, and the Shareholder
acknowledges that Parent and Sub may in ParentÂ’s sole discretion, file this
Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity. The
Shareholder agrees to promptly give Parent any information it may reasonably
require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and the
Shareholder agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with
respect to any written information supplied by it specifically for use in any
such disclosure document, if and to the extent that any such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.

 



6 4.5 _No Solicitation_. (i) The Shareholder shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and other
representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Competing Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal and (ii) from and after
the date hereof until the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the termination
of this Agreement, the Shareholder shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and other representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate
or encourage the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing
Proposal, (B) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to any third person in connection with or in response to
any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, Competing Proposal or (C) enter into, continue or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person relating
to any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal..

 

4.6 _Adjustments_. In the event (a) of reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction affecting the
Subject Shares or (b) that the Shareholder shall become the beneficial owner
of any additional Shares, then the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the
Shares held by the Shareholder immediately following the effectiveness of the
events described in clause (a) or the Shareholder becoming the beneficial
owner thereof as described in clause (b), as though, in either case, they
were Subject Shares hereunder. In the event that the Shareholder shall become
the beneficial owner of any other securities entitling the holder thereof to
vote or give consent with respect to the matters set forth in Section 4.1
hereof, then the terms of Section 4.1 hereof shall apply to such other
securities as though they were Subject Shares hereunder.

Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to
commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above
in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware
as described in this Agreement. Each of the parties further agrees that
notice as provided in this Agreement shall constitute sufficient service of
process, and the parties

 



8 further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described in this Agreement for any
reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A)
the Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE
FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 5.6(c).

5.7. _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement may
be executed in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

5.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

5.9.  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



9 5.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. No party shall require the other to post any
bond or other security as a condition to institute any Proceeding for specific
performance under this this Section 5.10.

 

5.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As
used in this Agreement, the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or theory extends and such phrase shall not
mean "if." If the last day for the giving of any notice or the performance of
any act required or permitted under this Agreement is a day that is not a
Business Day, then the time for the giving of such notice or the performance
of such action shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Except
as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections, and
"Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and the
Exhibits to this Agreement. The term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.
The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. In this Agreement, references to "as
of the date of this Agreement," "as of the date hereof" or words of similar
import shall be deemed to mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

5.12.  _Further Assurances_. Parent, Sub and the Shareholder will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all further documents and
instruments and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations, to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



10 5.13. _No Agreement Until Executed_. This Agreement shall not be effective
unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto,
and (ii) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.

 

5.14. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The Shareholder signs this Agreement solely
in the ShareholderÂ’s capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and not in any
other capacity (including, without limitation, as a director, officer or
employee of the Company) and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect the actions
of the Shareholder or any affiliate, employee or designee of the Shareholder
or any of its affiliates in its capacity, if applicable, as an officer or
director of the Company, and no action taken in any such capacity as an
officer or director of the Company shall be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Agreement.

5.15 _No Ownership Interest_. Except as otherwise provided herein, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Sub any
direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to
the Subject Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and
relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the
Shareholder, and neither Parent nor Sub shall have any authority to manage,
direct, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or
operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct the
Shareholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise provided
herein.
