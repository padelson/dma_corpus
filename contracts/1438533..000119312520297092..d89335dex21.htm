made within 45 days after the dispute is submitted for its determination and shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Purchaser. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.09</U>

Dispute Auditor, and shall give the Dispute Auditor access to all data and other information it reasonably requests for purposes of such resolution. In no event shall the decision of the Dispute Auditor assign a value to any item greater than the
