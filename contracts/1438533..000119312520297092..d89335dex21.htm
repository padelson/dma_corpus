***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



26

    

calculation of (i) the Closing Working Capital and Closing Working Capital

Expenses, and (vi) the Closing Payment. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller,
concurrently with the Purchaser Closing Statement, all relevant supporting
documentation, including such schedules and data with respect to the
determinations set forth therein as may be, in Purchasers determination,
reasonably appropriate to support the calculations set forth therein.
Following the delivery of the Purchaser Closing Statement, if applicable,
Purchaser shall provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access,
during regular business hours, in such a manner as to not interfere with the
normal operation of Purchaser or the Company (subject to the execution of
customary work paper access letters, if requested), to work papers, books and
records, and personnel and external representatives relating to the
preparation of the Purchaser Closing Statement solely for the purpose of
assisting Seller in its review of the Purchaser Closing Statement and the
calculations contained therein.

 

(b) If Seller disagrees with the calculations in the Purchaser Closing
Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser of such disagreement in writing (the
" _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ") within 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Purchaser Closing Statement. The Adjustment Dispute Notice must set forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Purchaser Closing Statement which
Seller reasonably believes has not been prepared in accordance with this
Agreement and Sellers determination of the amount of such item and (ii)
Sellers alternative calculation of the Closing Working Capital and
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Cash Adjustment Amount, the
Closing Indebtedness, the Company Service Provider Termination Expenses, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, and the Closing Payment, as the case may be,
together with all relevant supporting documentation. Any item or amount that
Seller does not dispute in reasonable detail in the Adjustment Dispute Notice
within such 30-day period shall be final, binding, and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event any such Adjustment Dispute Notice is timely
provided, Purchaser and Seller shall work in good faith for a period of 30
calendar days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the calculations included in the Purchaser
Closing Statement that were disputed in the Adjustment Dispute Notice. If, at
the end of such period, Seller and Purchaser remain unable to resolve the
dispute in its entirety, then the unresolved items and amounts thereof in
dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller, which shall not be the
independent accountants of Purchaser or the Company (the " _Dispute Auditor_
"). The Dispute Auditor shall determine, based solely on the written
presentations by Seller and Purchaser, and not by independent review, only
those items and amounts that remain then in dispute as set forth in the
Adjustment Dispute Notice. In rendering its decision, the Dispute Auditor
shall adhere to and be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.05(b)_ and
the applicable provisions and definitions set forth in this Agreement. The
Dispute Auditors determination of the Closing Working Capital and Closing
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Cash Adjustment Amount, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Company Service Provider Termination Expenses, the Closing
Transaction Expenses, and the Closing Payment as applicable, shall be made
within 45 days after the dispute is submitted for its determination and shall
be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Purchaser. A
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to _Section
11.09_ hereof may be entered upon the Dispute Auditors determination. The
Dispute Auditor shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the
Dispute Auditor as provided in this _Section 2.05(b)_ shall be the only
recourse and remedy of the Parties against one another with respect to, those
items and amounts that remain in dispute under this _Section 2.05(b)_, and
Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification or recovery of any
attorneys fees or other professional fees incurred by Purchaser in
connection with any dispute governed by this _Section 2.05_. The Dispute
Auditor shall, in its final written determination, allocate its fees and
expenses between Purchaser and Seller according to the degree to which the
positions of the respective Parties are not accepted by the Dispute Auditor.
Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate in good faith with the Dispute Auditor, and
shall give the Dispute Auditor access to all data and other information it
reasonably requests for purposes of such resolution. In no event shall the
decision of the Dispute Auditor assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller or
lesser than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or
Seller. Any determinations made by the Dispute Auditor pursuant to this
_Section 2.05(b) _ 

 



27

    

shall be final, non-appealable and binding on the Parties hereto, absent
manifest error or fraud. The Purchaser Closing Statement, as adjusted
pursuant to this _Section 2.05b)_, shall constitute the " _Final Closing
Statement._ " If Purchaser fails to deliver a Purchaser Closing Statement
within the 90 day period set forth in  _Section 2.05a)_, the Estimated
Closing Statement shall constitute the " _Final Closing Statement_."

(c) " _Adjustment Amount_ " means the net amount, which may be positive or
negative, equal to: (i)(A) the Estimated Closing Working Capital; _minus_ (B)
the amount of the Closing Working Capital (as finally determined
in accordance with _Section 2.05(b)_); _plus_ (ii)(A) the Estimated Closing
Cash Adjustment Amount; _minus_ (B) the amount of Cash Adjustment Amount (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.05(b)_);  _plus_ (iii)(A)
the Estimated Closing Indebtedness; _minus_ (B) the amount of Closing
Indebtedness (as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.05(b)_);
_plus_ (iv)(A) the Estimated Company Service Provider Termination Expenses;
_minus_ (B) the amount of the Closing Company Service Provider Termination
Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.05(b)_); _plus_
(v)(A) the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses; _minus_ (B) the amount of
Closing Transaction Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 2.05(b)_), in each case, as set forth on the Final Closing
Statement. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Closing
Payment shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount
is a negative number, the Closing Payment shall be decreased by the Adjustment
Amount. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then within five
Business Days after the final determination of the amount pursuant to _Section
2.05(b)_, Purchaser shall deliver the Adjustment Amount in cash to Seller. If
the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Purchaser shall be entitled
to recover the absolute value of such amount from the Escrow Fund, and,
within five Business Days after the final determination of such amount
pursuant to _Section 2.05(b)_, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser the absolute value of such amount from
the Escrow Fund; it being understood that, following the exhaustion of the
Escrow Fund, Purchaser shall also be entitled to receive the absolute value of
any balance amount as an offset against [***]% of any Contingent Payments
earned pursuant to _Section 2.07_, in accordance with _Section 9.10_.

(d) The Estimated Closing Statement shall control solely for the purposes of
determining the payments to be made on the Closing Date pursuant to _Section
2.04_ and shall not limit or otherwise affect Purchasers remedies under this
Agreement or otherwise constitute an acknowledgement by Purchaser of the
accuracy thereof.

Section 2.06 _Designation of Affiliate_. Prior to, and in any event at least
ten Business Days in advance of, the Closing, Purchaser may designate a
wholly-owned Affiliate to, at the Closing, acquire the Shares, by delivery of
written notice to Seller of such designation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
if Seller is adversely impacted by the designation of such Affiliate,
Purchaser shall fully indemnify and hold harmless Seller in respect of any
Losses of Seller resulting, directly or indirectly, therefrom (including (a)
any adverse Tax consequences to Seller as a result of such Affiliate being a
non-U.S. entity or transferring funds from a non-U.S. account, (b) any
required antitrust or competition approvals or waiting periods, or (c) delay
in providing KYC or other information required by the Registered Agent,); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such designation shall in any event limit or
affect the obligations or liabilities of Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.07 _Contingent Payments_. Seller may be entitled to certain
additional contingent payments after the Closing, each net of any Contingent
Payment Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as described and subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Section 2.07_ and the right of set off in
_Section 9.10_.

Regulatory Milestones by any Contingent Payment Obligor, the corresponding

Calendar Quarter, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in accordance with _Section
2.08_, the Additional Consideration Payment for such Calendar Quarter.

 

(iv) By way of example and without limitation of this _Section 2.07(e)_, if
aggregate Net Sales of a Product by Purchaser or its Affiliates were $[***]
for a given Calendar Year, then the Additional Consideration Payment payable
with respect to such Net Sales for such Product for such Calendar Year,
subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.07(e)(v)_, would be $[***]:
($[***] x [***]%) + ($[***] x [***]%). Purchasers obligation to make
Additional Consideration Payments under this _Section 2.07(e)_ shall apply,
on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, only during
the applicable Additional Consideration Term applicable to such country.
Following expiration of the Additional Consideration Term for any Product with
respect to a given country, no further Additional Consideration Payments shall
be payable in respect of sales of such Product in such country and sales of
such Product shall be excluded from Net Sales for purposes of determining the
tiers of annual Net Sales in _Section 2.07(e)_.

 

(v) _Additional Consideration Reductions_.

 

(A) If the Additional Consideration Term for a Product continues solely due to
clause (a) of the definition of Additional Consideration Term, then the
Additional Consideration Payment payable with respect to such country for such
Product will thereafter be reduced by [***]%, which reduction will be
calculated by determining the portion of total Net Sales of the relevant
Product in a Calendar Year that is attributable to the country in which such
reduction applies, and determining the total additional consideration payable
for such Product without reduction, and then reducing by [***]% the applicable
portion (based on Net Sales of such Product in such country as a percentage
of total Net Sales of such Product) of total additional consideration
attributable to such Product in such country.

 

(B) If a Loss of Market Exclusivity exists with respect to a country in a
Calendar Year, then the rate set forth in  _Section 2.07(e)(i)_ with respect
to Net Sales in such country for such Product will be reduced as follows, in
each case, solely for as long as such Loss of Market Exclusivity continues in
the relevant country and solely in such country and for such Product: (1) if
such Loss of Market Exclusivity exists due to clause (b)(i) of the definition
of a Loss of Market Exclusivity, then the rate set forth in _Section
2.07(e)(i)_ will be reduced to [***]% of the rate set forth in _Section
2.07(e)(i)_; (2) if such Loss of Market Exclusivity exists due to clause
(b)(ii) of the definition of Loss of Market Exclusivity, then the rate set
forth in _Section 2.07(e)(i)_ will be reduced to [***]% of the rate set
forth in _Section 2.07(e)(i)_; and (3) if such Loss of Market Exclusivity
exists due to clause (b)(iii) of the definition of a Loss of Market
Exclusivity, then the rate set forth in _Section 2.07(e)(i)_ will be reduced
to [***]% of the rate set forth in _Section 2.07(e)(i)_, which reduction will
be calculated by determining the portion of total Net Sales of the relevant
Product in a Calendar Year that is attributable to the country in which
such reduction applies, and determining the total additional consideration
payable for such Product without reduction, and then reducing by the
applicable percentage the applicable portion (based on Net Sales of such
Product in such country as a percentage of total Net Sales of such Product)
of total additional consideration attributable to such Product in such
country.

(C) In the event that sales of the Product by any Selling Party would, but
for the grant of a license by a Third Party to such Selling Party (other than
any licenses granted to the Company prior to the date hereof), infringe an
issued Patent Right of such Third Party, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, and in addition to other rights hereunder or otherwise, in
the event such Selling Party enters into an agreement with such Third Party to
obtain a license or other right (including a covenant not to sue) under such
issued Patent Right in order to avoid such infringement during the Additional
Consideration Term (each a " _Third Party License_"), then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, and in addition to other rights hereunder or
otherwise, Purchaser may deduct [***]% of any additional consideration amount
(or comparable payment based on sales of Product) payable by Purchaser or its
Affiliates in any Calendar Year to such Third Party in consideration for such
Third Party License from the Additional Consideration Payment

that would otherwise be due in any Calendar Year pursuant to _Section
2.07(e)_. Any amount of additional consideration paid to such Third Party
which is entitled to be deducted under this _Section 2.07(e)(v)(C)_, but is
not deducted as a result of the limitation in _Section 2.07(e)(v)(D)_, shall
be carried over from year to year and applied against Additional
Consideration Payments payable to Seller in respect of such Product in such
country in subsequent Calendar Years until the full deduction is taken.

 

(D) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will any
Additional Consideration Payment due to Seller under this  _Section 2.07(e)_
be reduced to less than [***]% of the rate set forth in _Section 2.07(e)(i)_
through operation of the reductions set forth in this _Section 2.07(e)(v)_,
whether alone or together; _provided_ , that, if the reduction provided by
_Section 2.07(e)(v)(B)(3)_ applies, any Additional Consideration Payment due
to Seller under this _Section 2.07(e)_ may be reduced to [***]% of the rate
set forth in  _Section 2.07(e)(i)_ through operation of the reductions set
forth in _Section 2.07(e)(v)(B)(3)_.

(f) _Additional Consideration with respect to the ROW Territory_.

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this  _Section
2.07(f)_, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, during the
applicable Additional Consideration Term for a given Product, Purchaser shall
make additional cash consideration payments to Seller, as calculated
by multiplying the applicable amount of incremental Net Sales of such Product
in a Calendar Year in the ROW Territory by the corresponding additional
consideration rate, as set forth in the table below and by subsequently making
the applicable adjustments in accordance with _Section 2.07(f)(v)_ below
(each, an " _ROW Additional Consideration Payment_ "):



        |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  

Net Sales for a Product in a Given Calendar Year

 |  | Additional Consideration Rate | 
    

Portion of Net Sales within the ROW Territory of a given Product in a given
Calendar Year up to and including $[***]

 |  |  | [ | ***]% 
  

Portion of Net Sales within the ROW Territory of a given Product in a given
Calendar Year in excess of $[***]

 |  |  | [ | ***]% 
 

(ii) The applicable additional consideration rate set forth in the table above
will apply only to that portion of the Net Sales within the ROW Territory of
a Product during a given Calendar Year that falls within the indicated range.

(iii) Within [***] Business Days of the delivery of a Net Sales Report for a
Calendar Year, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in accordance with _Section
2.08_, the ROW Additional Consideration Payment for such Calendar Year.

 

(iv) By way of example and without limitation of this _Section 2.07(f)_, if
aggregate Net Sales of a Product by Purchaser or its Affiliates were $[***]
for a given Calendar Year, then the ROW Additional Consideration Payment
payable with respect to such Net Sales for such Product for such Calendar
Year, subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.07(f)(v)_, would be
$[***]: ($[***] x [***]%) + ($[***] x [***]%). Purchasers obligation to make
ROW Additional Consideration Payments under this _Section 2.07(f)_ shall
apply, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, only during the
applicable Additional Consideration Term applicable to such country. Following
expiration of the Additional Consideration Term for any Product in a given
country, no further ROW Additional Consideration Payments shall be payable in
respect of sales of such Product in such country and sales of such Product
shall be excluded from Net Sales for purposes of determining the tiers of
annual Net Sales in _Section 2.07(f)_.

(v) _ROW Additional Consideration Reductions_. The reductions set forth in
Section  _2.07(e)v)_ shall apply to ROW Additional Consideration payments,
mutatis mutandis.

(g) _ROW Transaction Revenue_.

 

(i) If Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates enters into an
agreement with a Third Party for an Acquired IP Rights Sale or Acquired IP
Rights License (excluding Liens granted to lenders or foreclosure on such
Liens) with respect to any country or countries in the ROW Territory
(excluding non-exclusive licenses to contractors, contract manufacturing
organizations or contract research organizations, or to other similar Third
Parties in connection with services provided to the Company, Purchaser, or any
of their respective Affiliates) (a " _ROW Third Party Agreement_ "), Purchaser
shall pay to Seller, in respect of such country or countries, an amount equal
to [***]% of all ROW Transaction Revenue.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ROW Transaction Revenue_ " means the
gross proceeds received by Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates
under the applicable ROW Third Party Agreement attributable to the Acquired IP
Rights Sale or Acquired IP Rights License, including cash and non-cash
consideration, in consideration of the grant of such rights, including any up-
front, milestone, or any other contingent consideration received in
consideration of the grant of such rights, in each case as determined in
accordance with the Contingent Payment Accounting Principles of Purchaser, the
Company, or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, _minus_ the following
amounts that were actually incurred, allowed, paid, or accrued in
the financial statements of Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates
prepared in accordance with the Contingent Payment Accounting Principles: (A)
any refunds, rebates, or chargebacks actually paid to such Third Party under
such ROW Third Party Agreement, and (B) amounts paid by Purchaser, the
Company, or any of their Affiliates to any Third Party solely in connection
with such ROW Third Party Agreement, including consideration paid to Third
Parties under the terms of IP Licenses and reasonable costs paid to lawyers,
accountants, investment bankers, and other advisors; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, ROW Transaction Revenue shall exclude:

 

(A) funding or reimbursement for patent filing, prosecution, and maintenance
costs and expenses;

 

(B) any amounts received exclusively for research and development activities
conducted by or on behalf of Purchaser or for services provided or Products
or other goods or materials supplied by Purchaser, including any such payments
pursuant to co-development agreements, distributor agreements, or other
agreements with collaboration partners, contract research organizations,
contract manufacturing organizations, or contract sales organizations (except
to the extent such amounts are not used for such purposes);

(C) payment for debt or equity securities of Purchaser or its Affiliates to
the extent of the fair market value of such securities as of the date of
receipt of such payments;

 

(D) loans (except to the extent forgiven); and

 

(E) with respect to an Acquired IP Rights License, royalties, additional
consideration, profit sharing, or similar payments based on sales of Product,
Developed Product or Substitute Product; _provided_ , that Net Sales by the
Third Party licensee shall constitute Net Sales for purposes of _Section
2.07(f)_.

 

(iii) The ROW Transaction Revenue shall be paid in accordance with _Section
2.08_, within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof by Purchaser.

(iv) There shall be no double counting in determining any deduction or
exclusion from ROW Transaction Revenue.

(v) If rights to any product that is not a Product or any technology or
intellectual property that is not part of the Acquired IP Rights is included
in any Acquired IP Rights License or Acquired IP Rights Sale, and the fair
market value of the amount attributable to such other product or other
technology or intellectual property is not specifically determined and stated
in the applicable ROW Third Party Agreement, the fair market value of the
amount attributable to the Product or the Acquired IP Rights that are included
in the transaction will be determined in good faith by Purchaser, subject
to Sellers rights set forth in _Section 2.09_. Concurrently with the
execution of any ROW Third Party Agreement, Purchaser shall provide an
executed copy of such ROW Third Party Agreement to Seller; _provided_ , that
Purchaser may redact any competitively sensitive information from such
agreement that is not necessary for Seller to confirm Purchasers compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(vi) If Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates receives non-
monetary consideration under a ROW Third Party Agreement, or in the case of
transactions pursuant to a ROW Third Party Agreement that was not at arms
length between Purchaser, the Company, or such Affiliate and the Third Party,
the ROW Transaction Revenue shall be calculated assuming an arms
length transaction.

(h) _Diligence Obligations_. Following the Closing, Purchaser, by itself or
through the Company, its other Affiliates, or their respective licensees,
contractors, any other Contingent Payment Obligor, or any Third Party acting
on behalf of the foregoing, shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
(i) Develop a Product and achieve Regulatory Acceptance with respect to such
Product from both FDA and EMA (or the applicable Regulatory Authority in at
least two of the Major Markets) for the first Indication, (ii) subject to such
Regulatory Approval, to commence First Commercial Sale of and
to Commercialize such Product in each of the United States and the European
Market, and (iii) file a Rare Pediatric Disease Product Application seeking
receipt of a Priority Review Voucher. Purchaser shall not, directly or
indirectly, by itself or through the Company, its other Affiliates, or their
respective licensees, take any action or omit to take any action, the primary
purpose of which is to avoid the payment of any Contingent Payment. The
obligations of Purchaser set forth in this  _Section 2.07(h)_ shall
terminate upon the date that is [***] years after the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that if Development and Regulatory Milestone 1b is achieved and
paid in full to Seller (subject to Purchasers right of offset set forth in
_Section 9.10_), the obligations of Purchaser set forth in this _Section
2.07(h)_ shall terminate upon the date that is [***] years after the Closing
Date (the " _Diligence Obligations Period_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the obligations of Purchaser set forth in this _Section 2.07(h)_ shall also
terminate with respect to any jurisdiction in which Seller obtains the rights
to any Product, OT-58, the OT-58 program or the Acquired IP Rights pursuant
to, and as of the effective date of, any Termination Transfer.

(i) _Cessation of Development or Commercialization_. If any Contingent
Payment Obligor determines to cease or suspend, in its entirety, its
Development or Commercialization of OT-58 or any Product during the Diligence
Obligations Period (the " _Abandonment_ ") in any of (A) [***], (B) [***], or
(C) [***] (such market, a " _Terminated Market_ ") (for clarity, a Contingent
Payment Obligors decision to partner with a Third Party in any
such Terminated Market shall not be deemed an Abandonment), in each case in
which such Contingent Payment Obligor held the rights to conduct such
Development or Commercialization in such Terminated Market, Seller shall be
permitted to exercise its right of first negotiation (the " _ROFN_ "), which
shall be exercisable only once per Terminated Market, to negotiate with such
Contingent Payment Obligor for the transfer of all rights to OT-58 (or to the
relevant Product) and the OT-58 program (or the relevant Product program)
held by such Contingent Payment Obligor with respect to such Terminated Market
to Seller on commercially reasonable terms. Within [***] days of Abandonment
in any Terminated Market, such Contingent Payment Obligor shall provide
Seller with a reasonably detailed written notice of such Abandonment and
opportunity to commence customary due diligence of information in such
Contingent Payment Obligors possession or control reasonably necessary
or useful for Sellers

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



35

    

evaluation of whether to exercise the ROFN. Within [***] days of receipt of
such Contingent Payment Obligors notice (the " _ROFN Notice Period_ "),
Seller shall deliver notice to such Contingent Payment Obligor of whether it
desires to commence due diligence (the " _ROFN Expression of Interest_ "),
which shall continue for a period of no more than [***] days. Following the
completion of due diligence, Seller shall provide notice to such Contingent
Payment Obligor as to whether Seller has determined to exercise the ROFN, and
if such ROFN is exercised, such notice shall include a detailed written offer
to acquire the rights to OT-58 (or the relevant Product) and the OT-58 program
(or the relevant Product program) in such Terminated Market, which will
include all of the relevant terms and conditions, including proposed purchase
price, timing, and method of payment. Following receipt of notice that Seller
has exercised the ROFN, such Contingent Payment Obligor shall negotiate in
good faith for a period of [***] days, or a longer period mutually agreed in
writing between the Parties (the " _ROFN Negotiation Period_ ") with Seller
with the aim of, and seeking to, agree upon the terms and conditions of an
agreement to sell or transfer all of such Contingent Payment Obligors rights
to OT-58 (or the relevant Product) and the OT-58 program (or the relevant
Product program) in such Terminated Market to Seller. If (A) such Contingent
Payment Obligor does not receive Sellers ROFN Expression of Interest within
the ROFN Notice Period, or (B) during the ROFN Negotiation Period, such
Contingent Payment Obligor and Seller fail to enter into a definitive
agreement for such sale or transfer of OT-58 (or the relevant Product) and the
OT-58 program (or the relevant Product program), then such Contingent Payment
Obligor will be permitted to sell or transfer or otherwise dispose of such
rights to OT-58 (or the relevant Product) and the OT-58 program (or the
relevant Product Program) to any Person. If such Contingent Payment Obligor
and Seller enter into a definitive agreement for such sale or transfer of
OT-58 (or the relevant Product) and the OT-58 program (or the relevant Product
program), and Seller obtains any rights to OT-58 (or the relevant Product)
and the OT-58 program (or the relevant Product program) pursuant to such
definitive agreement (a " _Termination Transfer_ "), (1) all sales,
dispositions, and other activities and results with respect to the Product in
the Terminated Market (or portion thereof or other territory covered by such
definitive agreement) shall be excluded for all purposes under this Agreement,
including being excluded from Net Sales and Contingent Payments payable
hereunder, and (2) no Contingent Payment will become due hereunder as a
result of any Development, manufacture, Commercialization, Exploitation,
license, sublicense, transfer, assignment or other disposition of such Product
or the Acquired IP Rights in such Terminated Market (or portion thereof or
other territory covered by such definitive agreement) by or on behalf of
Seller or any other Person that obtains any rights to any Product, OT-58, the
OT-58 program or any of the Acquired IP Rights from the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, which Seller obtains pursuant to any
Termination Transfer.

(j) _Reporting; Audits_.

(i) Purchaser shall keep and maintain, and shall require that its Affiliates
(including the Company) and any Contingent Payment Obligor or other Selling
Party, keep and maintain, for the period required under applicable Laws, but
in no event less than [***] years from the end of the Calendar Quarter to
which they pertain, complete and accurate books, ledgers, and other records
of Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company) or applicable
Contingent Payment Obligor or other Selling Party, as the case may be, with
respect to each Product (collectively, " _Purchaser Records_ "), as
necessary to enable (A) Purchaser to provide the Reports pursuant to _Section
2.07(j)_, and (B) Seller to perform an audit as contemplated by this _Section
2.07(j)_.

 

(ii) From and after the Closing Date and for so long as the Contingent
Payments may become payable, Purchaser shall provide, in accordance with
_Section 11.04_, Seller, on a [***] basis by the [***] day following the end
of each [***] period following such initial [***] anniversary, with reasonably
detailed written reports, on a country-by-country (if applicable) and on
an aggregate basis, of the status of activities of any Contingent Payment
Obligor or other Selling Party reasonably pertinent to the Contingent Payments
and diligence and other obligations of Purchaser under _Section 2.07_ and any
material developments (including commencement of IND-enabling studies) which
would reasonably be expected to lead to filing of an IND with respect to any
Developed Product or Excluded Product (each such report, a 

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



36

    

" _Status Report_ "). Each Status Report shall be in a form proposed by
Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to Seller.

(iii) From and after the date of the First Commercial Sale of a Product,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to (A) within [***] days
following the end of each Calendar Quarter, provide to Seller a report, on a
country-by-country and on an aggregate basis (a " _Net Sales Report_ ", and
together with the Status Reports, the " _Reports_ ") of (1) the number of
Products sold during such period, (2) the calculation of Net Sales and any ROW
Transaction Revenue for such period (including a reasonably detailed breakdown
of any deductions), (3) any Milestone Payment owed to Seller in accordance
with this Agreement for the period covered by such Report, (4) any Additional
Consideration Payment owed to Seller in accordance with this Agreement for the
period covered by such Report, including the applicable rate set forth in
_Section 2.07(e)(i)_ and reasonable details of any reductions in accordance
with _Section 2.07(e)(v)_ applied by Purchaser in respect thereof, (5) any
ROW Additional Consideration Payment owed to Seller in accordance with this
Agreement for the period covered by such Report, including the applicable rate
set forth in _Section 2.07(f)(i)_ and any reductions in accordance with
_Section 2.07(f)(v)_ applied by Purchaser in respect thereof, and (6) any
ROW Transaction Revenue; and (B) make any Contingent Payments owed to Seller
hereunder in accordance with such report in arrears, concurrently with the
delivery of such Net Sales Report and in accordance with _Section 2.08_.
Each Net Sales Report shall be in a form proposed by Purchaser and reasonably
acceptable to Seller.

 

(iv) Upon not more than [***] calendar days prior written notice from Seller,
Purchaser shall permit access during normal business hours to the Purchaser
Records to be examined by certified public accountants at an independent
accounting firm of international standing appointed by Seller and reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, for the purpose of verifying the Reports or
the Contingent Payments payable to Seller, for a period covering not more
than the [***] years prior to the date of request; _provided_ that no period
shall be subject to inspection under this _Section 2.07(j)_ more than once
for the same purpose. Such audit shall not be performed more frequently than
[***] each Calendar Year; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent
Seller from conducting discovery, or making document requests, in connection
with a bona fide dispute under this Agreement. The auditor will execute a
reasonable written confidentiality agreement with Purchaser and will disclose
to Seller only such information as is reasonably necessary to provide Seller
with information regarding any actual or potential discrepancies between (A)
amounts reported and actually paid (and the corresponding information provided
in any Report) and (B) amounts payable under this Agreement, and reasonable
support therefor. The auditor will send a copy of the final report to
Purchaser at the same time it is sent to Seller. The report sent to both
Parties will include the methodology and calculations used to determine the
results. Any fees or expenses payable to an independent accounting firm
in connection with such examination shall be paid by Seller, except if the
results of the audit, as determined by the auditor, reveals any underreporting
of Net Sales of Products or underpayment of any Contingent Payment under this
Agreement of 5% or more in any reporting period, in which case the reasonable
out-of-pocket fees, costs, and expenses related to such audit, including those
of the independent accounting firm, shall be paid by Purchaser. If the audit
discloses an overpayment by Purchaser, then Purchaser will deduct the amount
of such overpayment from amounts otherwise owed to Seller under this
Agreement, unless no further payments are due hereunder, in which case the
amount of such overpayment shall be refunded by Seller to Purchaser. If the
audit discloses any underpayment by Purchaser, then the amount of such
underpayment shall be transmitted to Seller within [***] Business Days,
together with any applicable interest pursuant to _Section
2.10_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with any such audit.

 

(v) Within [***] calendar days after delivery of a Report, if Seller in good
faith requests a telephonic meeting with representatives of Purchaser or any
of Purchasers applicable Affiliates to discuss such Report, Purchaser shall
make available for such meeting at least one employee with operating
management responsibility for the activities of Purchaser or any such
Affiliate related to the contents of such Report.

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



37

    

(vi) All Purchaser Records and information provided to Seller or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 2.07(j)_, whether written or oral,
shall be confidential information of Purchaser and be held in confidence by
such Person except as permitted by _Section 6.03_; _provided_ , that Seller
(A) may disclose such information on a confidential basis (1) as required by
Law, and (2) to its Representatives who have a need to know such information
and who are under an obligation of confidentiality and non-use consistent with
the Sellers obligation hereunder, and (B) shall use such information solely
to assess Purchasers compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the value of, the progress towards, and the probability
of, achieving the Contingent Payments.

(k) _Non-Transferable Right_. The right of Seller to receive any amounts with
respect to Contingent Payments (i) shall not be evidenced by a certificate or
other instrument, (ii) shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by
Seller other than (A) pursuant to a court order, (B) by operation of Law
(including a consolidation or merger), (C) without consideration in
connection with the dissolution, liquidation, or termination of any trust,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or other entity,
(D)[***], (E) [***], (F) on one occasion to a Contingent Payment Purchaser in
compliance with this _Section 2.07(k)_ (it being agreed that Seller shall be
entitled to provide such Contingent Payment Purchaser with copies of the
Reports delivered by Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.07(j)_), or (G)
otherwise in compliance with _Section 11.01_, and (iii) does not represent
any right other than the right to receive the Contingent Payments and copies
of the Reports pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempted transfer of the
right to any amounts with respect to any Contingent Payment by any holder
thereof (other than as specifically permitted by the immediately preceding
sentence) shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
of any transfer of Sellers right to receive any amounts with respect to
Contingent Payments to a Contingent Payment Purchaser, (1) such Contingent
Payment Purchaser shall have agreed in writing, as a condition to the sale,
to be bound by (x) the terms and conditions of this Agreement related thereto,
including Purchasers right of offset set forth in _Section 9.10_ (and the
terms and conditions of this Agreement related to such offset rights), and
(y) confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in
_Section 6.03_, (2) the manner, timing, and disclosures related to such
transfer shall be in compliance with all applicable Laws, and (3) Seller
hereby agrees to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees in respect of, and hold
them harmless against and reimburse them for, any Losses suffered, incurred,
or sustained by any Purchaser Indemnitee resulting from or arising out of
any such transfer, including with respect to any claims by the Contingent
Payment Purchaser, except to the extent resulting from a breach of this
Agreement by a Purchaser Indemnitee.

 

(l) _Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree that for all Tax purposes, all
Contingent Payments shall be treated as Closing Payment consideration.

Section 2.08 _Mode of Payment_. All payments to be made, directly or
indirectly, to any Party under this Agreement shall be made by deposit of
United States Dollars in the requisite amount to such bank account as the
receiving Party may from time to time designate in writing to the paying
Party. For the purpose of calculating any sums under, or amounts reimbursable
pursuant to, this Agreement, the applicable Party shall convert any amount
expressed in a foreign currency into Dollar equivalents using the appropriate
foreign exchange rate for the currency quoted by the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, on the close of business on the banking day that is two
Business Days prior to the date that the calculation is to be made; _provided_
, that any such calculations which apply to Net Sales, gross sales, or other
sums outside of the United States shall first be determined in the currency
in which such sales are earned and shall then be converted into an amount in
United States Dollars for the applicable reporting period, and a copy of such
calculations shall be provided to the other Party. At least five Business
Days prior to any payment by Purchaser, Purchaser shall request that Seller
provide Purchaser with a written statement setting forth the amount of any
Contingent Payment Transaction Expenses payable in connection with such
Contingent Payment, and Seller shall provide such statement within two
Business Days after receipt of such request.

Section 2.09 _Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration, Allocation of
Consideration, or Determination of Consideration_.

(a) In the event that any non-cash consideration or that any consideration
that was not determined on an arms length and bona-fide basis has or would
reasonably be expected to become payable in respect of any sale, disposition,
or any other transfer under this Agreement, whether (i) Net Sales of Product,
(ii) in connection with the disposition of any Priority Review Voucher as
contemplated by _Section 2.07(c)(i)_ (or use of a Priority Review Voucher
without receipt of any consideration by Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates)
as contemplated by  _Section 2.07(c)(ii)_), or (iii) otherwise, then
Purchaser shall determine the fair market value of such consideration in good
faith assuming an arms length transaction made in the ordinary course of
business and shall provide the calculations and assumptions used for such
determination to Seller within 20 Business Days of such event. In the event
Seller disputes (A) such determination of fair market value, or (B) the amount
of any amounts calculated or consideration allocated by Purchaser to the
Acquired IP Rights pursuant to _Section 2.07(g)_, Seller shall notify
Purchaser in writing of the amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within
20 Business Days of receipt of Purchasers determination. In the event of
such a dispute, the Parties shall first negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts, but if the Parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within 10 Business Days of Sellers dispute notice, the
Parties shall conduct an independent valuation to determine fair market value,
as set forth in _Section 2.09(b)_ through _(e)_ :

 

(b) The Parties shall mutually agree on and engage a nationally recognized,
independent valuation firm, to perform the independent valuation. If the
Parties are unable to agree upon a valuation firm within 10 Business Days of
the date a Party first proposes a particular valuation firm, AAA shall appoint
an independent valuation firm, which firm shall not be the accountant or
auditor of either Seller or Purchaser, and shall not have advised either of
Purchaser or Seller in connection with the Transactions (the " _Independent
Valuation Firm_ ").

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Valuation Firm to issue its written determination
regarding the valuation at issue within 10 Business Days of being engaged by
Purchaser and Seller to perform the independent valuation. The Independent
Valuation Firm shall make a determination of the valuation in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Accounting
Principles. With respect to valuation of a Priority Review Voucher, the
Independent Valuation Firm may take into consideration, among other things,
recent publicly-filed transactions relating to the sale of Priority Review
Vouchers and the fair market value for transfer of such Priority Review
Voucher.

(d) Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, on
the date that the Independent Valuation Firm is engaged by Purchaser and
Seller, to the Independent Valuation Firm such work papers and other documents
and information pertaining to subject matter of the valuation of the Priority
Review Voucher as the Independent Valuation Firm may reasonably request. The
determination of the Independent Valuation Firm shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the Parties absent manifest error.

(e) The fees, expenses, and costs of the Independent Valuation Firm shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.

 

(f) Solely with respect to any valuation pursuant to _Section 6.16_ or
_Section 6.18_, if, after engaging in good faith negotiations pursuant to
such provision, the dispute at issue is to be submitted to the Independent
Valuation Firm for resolution, such matter will be determined through binding
"baseball" arbitration as follows: within 10 Business Days after appointment
of the Independent Valuation Firm in accordance with _Section 2.09(b)_, each
Party will deliver to the Independent Valuation Firm and to the other Party
its proposed consideration proposal (the " _Proposal_ ") and a memorandum
(the " _Support Memo_ ") in support thereof, together with any supporting
documentation the Party deems reasonably pertinent to the Independent
Valuation Firms determination. Each Partys Proposal, Support Memo, and such
supporting

 



39

    

documentation shall include only information or documentation that was
provided to the other Party in connection with the negotiations provided by
_Section 6.16_ or _Section 6.18_, as applicable, unless the Independent
Valuation Firm determines that exceptional circumstances exist and requests
additional information. Within 10 Business Days after receipt of the other
Partys Proposal and Support Memo and such supporting documentation, each
Party may submit to the Independent Valuation Firm (with a copy to the other
Party) a response to the other Partys Support Memo, which shall include only
information or documentation that was provided to the other Party in
connection with the negotiations provided by _Section 6.16_ or _Section
6.18_, as applicable, unless otherwise requested by the Independent Valuation
Firm as described in the preceding sentence. Except as directed by the
Independent Valuation Firm and in any event with both Parties present or
participating, neither Party may have any other communications (either written
or oral) with the Independent Valuation Firm other than for the sole purpose
of engaging the Independent Valuation Firm. Within the later of 30 days after
the receipt of the Proposals from both Parties or receipt of such additional
information or documentation as the Independent Valuation Firm may request
(provided that the Independent Valuation Firm may extend any time limits based
on a joint request from the Parties or if the Independent Valuation Firm
otherwise determines that an extension is necessary), the Independent
Valuation Firm will select one of the two Proposals provided by the Parties
(without modification) that the Independent Valuation Firm believes is most
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and industry standards, and is
otherwise commercially reasonable. The Independent Valuation Firm must select,
as the only method to resolve the matter at issue, one or the other of the
Proposals by the Parties and, absent agreement by the Parties, may
not combine elements of both Proposals or award any other relief or take any
other action. In the conduct of its work to resolve the matter at issue, the
Independent Valuation Firm may request such reasonable additional information
from any one, or both Parties, as the Independent Valuation Firm determines
may be necessary or useful in its resolution of the valuation dispute. Within
10 Business Days after the submission of such other information by a Party
(the "Submitting Party") to the Independent Valuation Firm (with a copy to
the other Party) in response to such a request by the Independent Valuation
Firm, the other Party may submit a response to the Independent Valuation Firm
(with a copy to the Submitting Party). The selection by the Independent
Valuation Firm of one Proposal will be binding and conclusive upon both
Parties and judgment on the Independent Valuation Firms determination may be
entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. The fees of the
Independent Valuation Firm shall be payable in accordance with _Section
2.09(e)_.

Section 2.10 _Interest on Late Payment_. Any amount owed by one Party to the
other Party under this Agreement that is not paid within the applicable time
period set forth herein shall accrue on a daily basis, from the date such
payment was required to be paid up to and including the actual date of
payment thereof, interest at the rate of (a) (i) the prime commercial lending
rate reported by the _Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, (the " _Prime
Rate_ ") on the date that such payment was required to be paid _divided by_
(ii) 12, _plus_ (b) [***]% per month (the " _Late Payment Interest Rate_ ");
_provided_ , that such rate shall not exceed the highest rate permitted under
applicable Laws.

 

Section 2.11 _Withholding_. Each of Purchaser, Seller, and the Company
acknowledge and agree that no amounts shall be deducted or withheld from any
amounts payable on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement. Each of
Purchaser, Seller, and the Company shall have the right to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable after the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are reasonably required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law; _provided, however_ , that the party intending to withhold or
deduct must notify the other parties of its intent to withhold or deduct and
basis therefor within a reasonable period of time prior to the payment subject
to possible withholding or deduction being made (such reasonable period of
time to be no less than five Business Days prior to the payment subject to
possible withholding or deduction). To the extent necessary, each of
Purchaser, Seller, and the Company shall cooperate to provide any necessary
Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8,
as applicable, and any similar information in order to establish any
exemptions from withholdings. To the extent that any payment to Seller or any
of its Affiliates under this Agreement of from the Escrow Fund, made at
or after the Closing Date becomes subject to withholding or deduction of Tax
by reason of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (a)

changing the location of their bank accounts, or making payments from a non-US
bank account, (b) no longer being U.S. Tax residents, or changing their tax
residence, or (c) making such change as would cause the Contingent Payments to
be paid by a non-U.S. payor, in each case such that a withholding Tax applies
on any payment made to Seller under this Agreement, Purchaser (i) shall be
required to pay to Seller such additional amount as shall ensure that Seller
is in the same net position it would have been in, after taking into account
the withholding or deduction (including in respect of any payment under this
_Section 2.11_), were it not for the withholding or deduction and (ii) will
not be required to provide advance notice of its intent to withhold or deduct
as contemplated in this  _Section 2.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, and regardless of whether Purchaser assigns its
rights under the Agreement to a non-US tax resident pursuant to _Section
11.01_, for purposes of applying  _Section 2.11_ and determining whether any
withholding applies and gross-up thereon Purchaser shall be treated as a US
tax resident at Closing.

Section 6.02 _Access to Information_. 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall direct [***]

and financial records related to the Company Business as is necessary or
reasonably useful to provide for an orderly transition and integration of the

Purchaser or its Representatives, the Company or its Affiliates may redact
any portions thereof that do not relate to the Company Business. If the
Company, Seller, or their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in
a 

 



60

    

Proceeding, none of the Company, Seller, or their respective Affiliates shall
be required to provide access to or disclose any information that is
reasonably pertinent thereto pursuant to this _Section 6.02(a)_. For clarity,
any information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be deemed to
be " _Confidential Information_ " related to the Company subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth in  _Section 6.06_, Purchaser hereby agrees that,
during the Pre-Closing Period, neither it nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is authorized to contact, and shall not contact, any customer,

Company Business, this Agreement, or the Transactions, without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld in the Companys
sole and absolute discretion.

Section 6.03  _Confidentiality_.

(a) Any Confidential Information provided to either Party shall be maintained
in confidence by the receiving Party and its Affiliates and shall not be
disclosed to a Third Party or used for any purpose, except as expressly
permitted under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
disclosing Party, except to the extent that such information, as shown by the
receiving Party by competent written proof:

(i) is publicly disclosed by the disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates either before or after it is disclosed to the receiving Party
hereunder;

(ii) is known by the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates at the time of
its receipt, and not through a prior disclosure by the disclosing Party or any
of its Affiliates or under an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing
Party or any of its Affiliates, as documented by the receiving
Partys contemporaneous business records;

(iii) is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates on a non-confidential basis by a Third Party that is not bound by
a similar duty of confidentiality or restriction on its use;

(iv) is now, or hereafter becomes, through no breach of this Agreement on the
part of the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates, generally known or
available, either before or after it is disclosed to the receiving Party;

Party or any of its Affiliates without the use of information belonging to
the disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates; or

(vi) is reasonably necessary to be disclosed to Seller in order for
the Company to comply with shareholder disclosure obligations under
applicable Law.

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ " means (i) in
the case of any Party, any information provided by or on behalf of such Party
to the other Party in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions,
including any confidential information disclosed pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) in the case of any Party, all information
disclosed prior to the date hereof by or on behalf of such Party, and (iii)
any other proprietary or confidential information of any Party or any of
its Affiliates, including, with respect to Seller, any information related to
OT-15 or the Excluded Assets; _provided_ , that after the Closing, all
confidential information regarding the Company, the Company Business, or the
assets of the Company (including the Registered IP Rights and the Products),
other than the Excluded

 



61

    

Assets, shall be deemed to be solely disclosed by Purchaser and Seller shall
be deemed the receiving Party thereto.

(c) Solely as used in this _Section 6.03_, "Affiliates" of Seller and the
Company (prior to the Closing) shall be deemed to include [***].

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.03(a)_, (i) any Party may disclose
Confidential Information to those Representatives of such Party who need to
know such information for the purpose of consummating any of the Transactions
and who agree to keep such information confidential and to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this  _Section 6.03_ to the same extent as if they
were parties hereto, and (ii) prior to the Closing, the Company shall be
permitted to use and disclose any Confidential Information regarding the
Company, the Company Business, or the assets of the Company (including the
Registered IP Rights and any Products) as necessary to operate the Company
Business in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , that any such
recipient of the Confidential Information agrees in writing to be bound by
confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this
_Section 6.03_.

(e) If and whenever any information of the disclosing Party is disclosed by
the receiving Party or any of its Affiliates in accordance with this _Section
6.03,_ such disclosure shall not cause any such information to cease to be
subject to the restrictions of this _Section 6.03_ except to the extent that
such disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information (other than
by breach of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may
disclose Confidential Information of the other Parties to the extent such
information (i) is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in prosecuting or
defending litigation, including responding to a subpoena in a Third Party
litigation, (ii) is required to be disclosed to comply with applicable Law or
court or administrative orders including regulations promulgated by applicable
security exchanges, or (iii) in connection with a permitted assignment or
transfer of this Agreement or a sale or license of the Product or any rights
thereto; _provided_ , that the potential assignee, transferee, or purchaser is
bound by obligations of confidentiality no less stringent than the provisions
of this Agreement. In the event that any Party is required to make a
disclosure of any other Partys Confidential Information pursuant to the
preceding sentence, it shall, except where impracticable, give reasonable
advance notice to such other Party of such disclosure and use not less than
the same efforts to secure confidential treatment of such information as it
would to protect its own confidential information from disclosure. This
Agreement supersedes the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that all
"Confidential Information" disclosed or received by the Parties thereunder
shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.03_.

 

Section 6.04 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations in Respect of the
Transactions_.

 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all Consents of all Governmental
Entities and officials that may be or become necessary or advisable for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with the other Party in promptly seeking
to obtain all such Consents, and (iii) provide such other information to any
Governmental Entity as such Governmental Entity may request in connection
herewith.

 

(b) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods
under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Without limiting, and subject to
_Section 6.04(a)_, and in connection with the foregoing, the Parties agree to
use good faith efforts to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all
meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to Antitrust Laws, (ii) to the

***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



62

    

practicable, give the other party reasonable advance notice of all oral
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to Antitrust Laws

Entity initiates an oral communication regarding the Antitrust Laws, promptly
notify the other party of the substance of such communication, (v) provide
each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with all
written communications with a Governmental Entity regarding the Antitrust

communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the Antitrust
Laws. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section
6.04_ as "outside counsel only," or otherwise redact such materials (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (B) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to
the extent that such attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns are not governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine.

including by providing or assisting Purchaser with obtaining
reasonable access to such Offered Company Service Provider and by providing
or assisting Purchaser with obtaining necessary information relating to the
terms and conditions of such individuals present employment or independent
contractor engagement, to the extent permissible under applicable Law. The
Company and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
employer or contracting entity of each Offered Company Service Provider who
accepts Purchasers offer of employment or engagement (each, a " _Continuing
Purchaser Service Provider_ ") to terminate its employment or engagement with
such Continuing Purchaser Service Provider, effective immediately prior to the

Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (each, a " _Continuing Purchaser Employee_
") with: (i) employment responsibilities that are substantially equivalent to
those responsibilities of such Continuing Purchaser Employee as of the
Closing; (ii) base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base
salary or hourly wages provided to such Continuing Purchaser Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, [***]; and (iii) employee health and welfare
benefits (excluding pension benefits and nonqualified deferred compensation
arrangements) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(c) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to grant all Continuing Purchaser Employees credit for any service to
such Continuing Purchaser Employees immediately prior employer earned prior
to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the
level of benefits under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
or arrangement in which a Continuing Purchaser Employee participates that may
be established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates on or after the
Closing (the " _New Plans_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
credit shall not be recognized to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of time. In addition, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cause
[***].

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 6.06_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, (i) is intended to confer
upon any Continuing Purchaser Service Provider or any other Person any right
to continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any benefit plan, (ii) shall alter or limit Purchasers or its
Affiliates ability to amend, modify, or terminate any particular benefit
plan, program, agreement, or arrangement, or (iii) is intended to confer upon
any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries
of employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

Section 6.07 _Publicity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and Purchaser
shall only issue press releases related to the activities contemplated by
this Agreement that have been approved by both Seller and

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

Purchaser. The initial press release with respect to the closing of the
Transactions shall be a joint press release acceptable to each of Seller,
Purchaser, and the Company, which shall include a quote from each of Seller or
the Company and Purchaser. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
any press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions shall be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner
as Seller, the Company, and Purchaser collectively determine. Unless consented
to by Seller, the Company, and Purchaser in advance or required by Law or
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or trading market on which securities of Purchaser of any of its
Affiliates are listed (in which case the Party required to make such
disclosure shall consult with the other Parties a reasonable time prior to
making such disclosure and shall consider in good faith any comments made by
the other Parties to such disclosure), the Parties shall keep this Agreement
strictly confidential and may not make any disclosure of this Agreement or
any of its terms to any Person. If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, based
on the advice of its counsel, determines that this Agreement must be publicly
filed with a Governmental Entity, then Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate,
prior to making such filing, shall provide Seller and its counsel with a
redacted version of this Agreement that it intends to file, and shall consider
in good faith any comments provided by Seller or its counsel and
use reasonable efforts to ensure the confidential treatment by such
Governmental Entity of those sections specified by Seller or its counsel for
redaction and confidentiality; _provided_ that the Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate shall have the right to make any such filing as it reasonably
determines necessary under applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prevent (a) Seller or any other member of the Seller
Group from making customary disclosures (which are made subject to
confidentiality obligations) to its investors in connection with its
fundraising or investing activities, or operations of its investment
businesses in the ordinary course of business, (b) each Party from making any
public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors,
or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst calls, or issue
press releases, so long as any such public statement or press release is
consistent with prior public disclosures or public statements approved by the
other Party pursuant to this _Section 6.07_ (including the initial joint
press release) and which do not reveal non-public information about the other
Party, or (c) each Party may, without such consent, make any public statement
in response to questions from customers or vendors, or make internal
announcements to employees, so long as such statements are consistent with
prior public disclosures or public statements approved by the other Party
pursuant to this _Section 6.07_ (including the initial joint press release)
and which do not reveal non-public information about the other Party.

 

Section 6.08 _Resignations_. Seller and the Company shall cause each director
and officer, as applicable, of the Company to resign in such capacity, such
resignations to be effective as of the Closing.

Section 6.09 _Further Action_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and other than with respect to the matters set forth in
_Section 6.04_ which will be governed by the terms and conditions set forth
therein, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken in an expeditious manner all actions and to do or cause to be done
all things reasonably necessary or appropriate to satisfy the conditions to
the Closing, to consummate the Acquisition and to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Closing.

Section 6.10 _Consents_. Subject to the accuracy of the Companys
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 4.03(a)_, Purchaser agrees
and acknowledges that Company and Seller shall not have any obligation to
obtain any Consent with respect to any Contract with a Third-Party, except
that each of Seller and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent set forth on _Schedule 6.10_.

 

Section 6.11 _Release Agreements_ _._ Prior to the Closing, each of Seller and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a
release agreement in the form of __Exhibit G-1__ from each individual that is
a director or officer of the Company as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date (effective immediately prior to the Closing).

 



65

    

Section 6.12 _Exclusive Dealings_. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither
Seller nor the Company shall, nor shall they authorize or permit any of their
Representatives (including, in the case of Seller, any other member of the
Seller Group) to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage the submission of
any proposal or offer from any Person or entity relating to any (a) merger or
consolidation of the Company with any other Person, (b) acquisition or
purchase of all or a material portion of the assets of, or the equity
interests in, the Company, (c) any agreement made, other than in the ordinary
course of business or in connection with the Spinout Agreements, with regard
to the IP Rights owned or licensed by the Company that would result in the
transfer of a substantial portion of the value of such IP Rights from the
Company to a Third Party, or (d) similar transaction or business combination
with respect to the Company (a " _Competing Transaction_ "), enter into a
letter of intent or Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to,
otherwise approve or recommend, participate in any or continue any ongoing
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
confidential or non-public information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person
to effect, a Competing Transaction. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
to, cease any existing activities, discussions, and negotiations with all
Persons (other than Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser) with respect to
any Competing Transaction. The Company shall (and shall cause the members of
the Seller Group, and the Company and the Seller Group shall direct their
respective representatives to) immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Person
(other than Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser) that relate to any
Competing Transaction as of the date of this Agreement, and promptly request
the destruction or return of any nonpublic information of the Company provided
to such Person. The Company shall, within 48 hours, advise Purchaser in
writing of any Competing Transaction or request for access to the properties,
books, or records of the Company by any Person who has informed the Company
that such Person is considering making, or has made, a proposal for a
Competing Transaction. Except to the extent that providing such summary would
violate the terms of any Contract to which the Company is a party as of the
date hereof, the Company will promptly provide Purchaser with a written
summary of the material terms relating to any proposal or offer relating to a
Competing Transaction received after the date hereof, and any materials
developments thereto.

Section 6.13 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) Purchaser and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification, and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing, now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company (each, a " _Company Indemnitee_ ") as provided in the
organizational documents of the Company as of the date of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years.

 

(b) Seller shall cause a member of the Seller Group to maintain, for six years
following the Closing Date, directors and officers liability insurance
coverage for the Company Indemnitees for events occurring prior to the Closing
Date, which shall provide such Company Indemnitees with coverage not less than
the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially
less favorable to the Company Indemnitees than, the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage maintained by or on behalf of the Company
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (the costs and expenses of
which insurance coverage shall be deemed a Transaction Expense).

(c) In the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person (or engages in any similar
transaction) and it shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such
case, Purchaser shall ensure that proper provision is made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company comply with the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.13_. The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are intended for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnitees and their
respective heirs and Representatives. The rights of all Company Indemnitees
under this _Section 6.13_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract, applicable Law or otherwise.

 



66

    

Section 6.14 _Seller Retained Materials_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
all of the following shall remain the property of Seller and the other members
of the Seller Group, as applicable, and neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any right to or interest therein: (a) all records and
reports prepared or received by Seller, the Company, any other member of the
Seller Group, or any of their respective Representatives in connection with
the sale of the Company, the Transactions, and any strategic alternatives to
the sale of the Company (including licensing transactions, strategic
collaborations, and any sale or issuance of securities of the Company)
including all analyses relating to the Company, Purchaser, or Purchasers
Affiliates so prepared or received, the portions of any materials and minutes
from the Companys board of directors regarding the Transactions, and any
agreements with any Representatives, and (b) all confidentiality agreements
with prospective purchasers of the Company or any portion thereof and any and
all negotiation agreements, bids, expressions of interest, and related
materials received from Third Parties with respect thereto. In addition,
Seller shall have the right to retain copies of the documents, materials, and
data relating to the conduct of the Company Business prior to the Closing Date
solely to the extent, and in each case subject to Sellers ongoing obligations
of confidentiality under this Agreement, (i) such retention is necessary for
compliance with applicable Law or any governmental rule or regulation or (ii)
such documents (including emails) have become embedded as electronic copies in
the electronic records system of any member of the Seller Group through
normal backup procedures.

Section 6.15 _Privileged Matters_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications prior to the Closing between
any of (a) Seller, (b) any of Sellers beneficiaries, [***] (collectively, the
" _Seller Group_ ") or the Company, on the one hand, and any of their legal
counsel, including the [***] in-house legal counsel, Hogan Lovells, Ogier, the
Seller Groups British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands legal counsel, DT
Ward, PC, the Companys intellectual property legal counsel, [***] (any such
legal counsel, individually and collectively, " _Seller Legal Counsel_ "), on
the other hand, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery, and performance under, or any dispute or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, all other Contracts, documents,
instruments, and certificates contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any
strategic alternatives to the Transactions, or any matter relating to any of
the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Company and the
Seller Group and such Seller Legal Counsel (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ ") and belong solely to the Seller Group, and from and after
the Closing neither the Company nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of
or through the Company shall have access to or shall seek to obtain or use
such communications, whether by seeking a waiver of or through any other means
(it being understood that any attorney-client privilege and expectation of
client confidence applicable to communications other than those set forth in
this sentence shall remain with the Company and in such case the Company or
any of the Companys Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by the Seller Group or
Seller Legal Counsel to the applicable Third Party). In the event of any
dispute between Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a Third Party, on the other hand, after the
Closing, the Company and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Seller Legal
Counsel to such Third Party. To the extent that files of any such Seller
Legal Counsel in respect of any Privileged Communications constitute property
of the client, only the Seller Group shall hold such property rights. As to
any such Privileged Communications prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors, or
assigns, further agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
_Section 6.15_, no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any Proceeding including against or involving any of the
Parties after the Closing.

Section 6.16 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.16(c)_, from and after the Closing Date until the
earlier of (i) the date that is [***] years after the Closing Date, and (ii)
[***] (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), Purchaser shall not, directly or
indirectly, itself or through its Affiliates (including the Company) or
licensees, alone or with any Third Party, whether as a partner, stockholder,
member, principal, agent, consultant, or in any other capacity, Develop,
manufacture, Commercialize, or otherwise Exploit, any Competitive Product.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.16(c)(ii)_, for a period of [***] following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, itself or through
its Affiliates (including the Company) or licensees, alone or with any Third
Party, whether as a partner, stockholder, member, principal, agent,
consultant, or in any other capacity, Develop, manufacture, Commercialize,
or otherwise Exploit, any Competitive Product or any Excluded Product.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i) On a product-by-product basis, upon the first commercial sale of a
Substitute Product by a Contingent Payment Obligor in the United States or
any country in the European Market, Seller shall be entitled to, and the
Parties shall agree upon the amount of, if any, additional cash consideration
payments to Seller, which may include up-front payments, milestones,
royalties, or other contingent consideration, that reflect the Contingent
Payments hereunder that would have otherwise reasonably been due to Seller but
for the Development (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any
Development of such Substitute Product by such Contingent Payment Obligor
during the Exclusivity Period) or the Commercialization of such Substitute
Product by such Contingent Payment Obligor (the " _Substitute Product
Consideration Payments_ "), as follows:

 

(A) No later than [***] days following the first commercial sale of the
Substitute Product in the United States or any country in the
European Market, Purchaser shall notify Seller of such first commercial sale
and, within [***] Business Days after a written request therefor from Seller,
provide to Seller a reasonable data package for the Substitute Product.
Thereafter, Purchaser shall permit Seller to conduct customary due diligence
for a period of up to [***] days, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to Sellers reasonable requests for data, documents, and
information related to the Substitute Product;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Purchaser does not respond to any such reasonable request within [***]
Business Days, the due diligence period shall be extended by the time period
of such delay. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of the
Substitute Product Consideration Payments, if any, for up to [***] months from
the date of first commercial sale of the Substitute Product by or on behalf of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates. Such Substitute Product
Consideration Payments shall take into account any sales of Substitute
Products anywhere in the world which may have commenced prior to the
determination of the Substitute Product Consideration Payments.

 

(B) Following such [***] month period, unless the Parties mutually agree to
extend the negotiation period, the dispute shall be submitted to an
Independent Valuation Firm pursuant to _Section 2.09(f)_ for determination of
the Substitute Product Consideration Payments. The terms that apply to the
Contingent Payments (except for the initial amounts of such payments
applied), including the definition of Net Sales and the reductions set forth
in _Section 2.07(e)(v)_, shall apply to the Substitute Product Consideration
Payments, _mutatis mutandis_ , as applicable. All Substitute Product
Consideration Payments shall be deemed Contingent Payments hereunder.

(ii) Upon a Change of Control of Purchaser, the foregoing restrictions in 
_Section 6.16(a)_ and _(b)_ will not apply to any Competitive Product or
Excluded Product owned or controlled on the effective date of such Change of
Control by any Affiliate of Purchaser who became an Affiliate of Purchaser 

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



68

    

 as a result of such Change of Control, _provided_ that such Affiliate: (i)
Segregates the Product program from the Competitive Product or Excluded
Product or (ii) within [***] months after the Change of Control (which period
shall be extended to the extent necessary to obtain any consents of any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction), the applicable Affiliate
Divests all of its and its Affiliates rights in and to the applicable
Competitive Product or Excluded Product, and notifies Seller in writing of
such action.

(iii) The foregoing restrictions in _Section 6.16(a)_ and _(b)_ will not
apply to any Competitive Product or Excluded Product program acquired by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company), if Purchaser and its
Affiliates, within [***] months after such acquisition (which period shall be
extended to the extent necessary to obtain any consents of any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction) Divest all of their respective rights in and
to the applicable Competitive Product or Excluded Product, and notify Seller
in writing of such action.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 6.16_, shall
prohibit Purchaser, directly or indirectly through one or more of its
Affiliates (including the Company), from being a passive owner of (i) not more
than [***]% of the outstanding stock of any class of a publicly traded
company which may own or control a Competitive Product or an Excluded Product;
or (ii) a private equity or similar fund which it does not control or act on
the advisory board or as a principal of the manager or general partner.

 

Section 6.17 _Reversion License_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and the Company hereby grants, effective as of the
Reversion Event Date, to Seller, without further action needed by any party,
an exclusive, royalty-free, assignable, worldwide license, with the right to
sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicense, under the Acquired IP Rights
owned or controlled by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company), to Exploit the Product and any Developed Product, subject to any
Third Party rights in or to the Acquired IP Rights, the Product and Developed
Products (the " _Reversion License_ ").

 

(b) Purchaser and the Company will execute all documents and take, or cause to
be taken, all such further actions as may be reasonably requested by Seller
in order to give effect to this _Section 6.17_. The Parties acknowledge that
certain additional activities may be required in order to facilitate a
transition of the Product or Developed Product(s) from Purchaser (or its
Affiliates, including the Company) to Seller, including with respect to the
transfer of certain regulatory approvals and regulatory materials, Third Party
agreements, and trademarks, in each case, solely to the extent exclusively
used in connection with the Product or Developed Product(s). The Parties
agree, if required by Seller no later than [***] days after the Reversion
Event Date, to discuss and negotiate in good faith an agreement providing for
such activities, to the extent applicable.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the right to refuse the
Reversion License, in its sole discretion, or to terminate the Reversion
License at any time upon [***] days prior written notice to Purchaser. For
clarity, all sales, dispositions, and other activities and results with
respect to the Product and any and all Developed Products under the Reversion
License shall be excluded for all purposes under this Agreement, including
being excluded from Net Sales, Contingent Payments payable hereunder and
Purchasers diligence obligations under _Section 2.07(h)_, and no
Contingent Payment will become due hereunder as a result of any Development,
manufacture, Commercialization, Exploitation, license, sublicense, transfer,
assignment or other disposition of any Product or Developed Product under the
Reversion License.

 

(d) All rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this _Section 6.17_
are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of
Title 11 of the United States Code and other similar laws in any jurisdiction
outside the U.S. (collectively, the " _Bankruptcy Laws_ "), licenses of rights
to be "intellectual property" as defined under the Bankruptcy Laws. If a case
is commenced following the Closing by or against Purchaser or the Company
under the Bankruptcy Laws then, unless and until this Agreement is

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



69

    

 rejected as provided in such Bankruptcy Laws, each of Purchaser and the
Company (in each case, in any capacity, including debtor-in-possession) and
its successors and assigns (including a trustee) shall perform all of the
obligations provided in this Agreement to be performed by Purchaser or the
Company, as applicable. If a case is commenced following the Closing by or
against Purchaser or the Company under the Bankruptcy Laws, this Agreement is
rejected as provided in the Bankruptcy Laws, and Seller elects to retain its
rights under this _Section 6.17_ as provided in the Bankruptcy Laws, then
Purchaser (in any capacity, including debtor-in-possession) and
its successors and assigns (including a Title 11 trustee), shall provide to
the Seller copies of all information necessary for Seller to prosecute,
maintain and enjoy its rights under the terms of this _Section 6.17_ promptly
upon Sellers written request therefor. All rights, powers and remedies of
the Seller as provided herein are in addition to and not in substitution for
any and all other rights, powers and remedies now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity (including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Laws) in the
event of the commencement of a case by or against Purchaser or the Company
under the Bankruptcy Laws.

 

(e) The rights and remedies provided this Section 6.17 are cumulative, and do
not exclude any other right or remedy otherwise available under this
Agreement.

Section 6.18 _Developed Products_.

 

(a) If and when a Contingent Payment Obligor (x) [***], or (y) Commercializes
any Developed Product:

 

(i) Purchaser shall provide notice of such [***] or Commercialization; and

 

(ii) the Parties shall agree on additional cash consideration payments to be
paid to Seller which may include payments based on the achievement of
Development or Commercialization milestones or payments based on net sales of
such Developed Product (the " _Developed Product Consideration Payments_ "),
as set forth in _Section 6.18(b)_ and _(c)_.

 

(b) Together with Purchasers delivery of notice pursuant to _Section
6.18(a)(i)_, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a reasonable data package,
[***] (if applicable). Thereafter, Purchaser shall permit Seller to conduct
customary due diligence for a period of up to [***] days, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to Sellers reasonable requests
for data, documents, and information related to the Developed Product;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser does not respond to any such
reasonable request within [***] Business Days, the due diligence period shall
be extended by the time period of such delay.

(c) The Developed Product Consideration Payments shall be no greater than the
aggregate amounts payable pursuant to analogous Contingent Payments for
Products, shall take into the account the value of such Developed Product, and
shall be sufficient to ensure that Seller is not unfairly disadvantaged by a
determination of Purchaser to pursue a Developed Product in addition to or in
lieu of a Product, and shall be determined as further described in _Section
6.18(d)_. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of the
Developed Product Consideration Payments for up to [***] months from the date
of delivery of the notice pursuant to _Section 6.18(a)(i)_. Thereafter,
unless the Parties mutually agree to extend the negotiation period, the
dispute shall be submitted to an Independent Valuation Firm pursuant to
_Section 2.09(f)_ for determination of the Developed Product Consideration
Payments. The terms of payment that apply to the Contingent Payments (except
for the initial amounts of such payments applied), including the definition of
Net Sales and the reductions set forth in _Section 2.07(e)(v)_, shall apply
to the Developed Product Consideration Payments, _mutatis mutandis_ , as
applicable. All Developed Product Consideration Payments shall be deemed
Contingent Payments hereunder.

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



70

    

(d) In determining the value of the Developed Product, the Parties will
consider (and will instruct the Independent Valuation Firm to take into
account), as applicable, the Development efforts and IP Rights contributed by
each Party (or the Company prior to the Closing, as compared with after the
Closing), safety and efficacy data, competitive advantage, barriers to entry,
the patent and other proprietary position of the product (including scope and
duration of relevant patents, length of marketing exclusivity, size and scope
of the potential commercial opportunity), availability of feasible
accelerated approval pathways, and cost of goods for such Developed Product,
the upfront price and contingent consideration that a willing buyer would pay
to a willing seller, in an arms length transaction, for the acquisition of
100% of the rights to such Developed Product, as well as any other factors the
Parties (or the Independent Valuation Firm, as applicable) determine to be
relevant to such determination.

 

Section 6.19 _Notification of Certain Events_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser of, and furnish Purchaser with any information it
may reasonably request with respect to, the occurrence of any event or
condition or the existence of any fact of which Seller obtains Knowledge that
may reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations
of Purchaser to consummate the Acquisition set forth in _Article VII_ not to
be satisfied (including any such breaches or inaccuracies of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ );
_provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of Seller or the Company to so
notify Purchaser of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty shall not give rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.02b)_. The Companys satisfaction of its obligations in the
foregoing sentence shall not relieve the Company of any of its other
obligations under this Agreement, and no disclosure by the Company pursuant to
this _Section 6.19_ shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Company
Disclosure Schedules or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, or breach of covenant, or waive any rights under _Article IX_.

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company
of, and furnish the Company with any information it may reasonably request
with respect to, or condition or the existence of any fact of which Purchaser
obtains Knowledge that may reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Acquisition
set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied (including any such breaches
or inaccuracies of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article V_
); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of Purchaser to so notify
the Company of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty shall not give rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.03(b). Purchasers satisfaction of its obligations in the foregoing
sentence shall not relieve Purchaser of any of its other obligations under
this Agreement, and no disclosure by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.17
shall be deemed to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
breach of covenant, or waive any rights under _Article IX_.

Section 6.20 _Financial Statements_. Subject to _Section 6.03_ and  _Section
6.07_, the Company shall, during the Pre-Closing Period, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser, at Purchasers sole cost and expense,
in the preparation and filing, of Current Reports on Form 8-K for Purchaser
containing the information required therein.

Section 6.21 _280G_. To the extent any payments made with respect to,
or which arise as a result of, this Agreement, could be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code, the Company shall (i) within five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, disclose its calculations with respect to the excess parachute payments
to Purchaser, along with the assumptions used to make the calculations and the
data necessary for Purchaser to confirm the accuracy of the calculations, (ii)
to the extent not already obtained, promptly seek the consent of the
recipient of any such payment that would otherwise be due and owing that such
payment shall not be due and owing, paid or retained (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ "), absent 280G Stockholder Approval (as defined below) (such
consents, the " _Parachute Payment Waivers_ "), and (iii) promptly (and in any
case prior to the Closing Date) cause all such payments to

 



71

    

be adequately disclosed to, and obtain the vote (whether of approval or
disapproval) and use commercially reasonably efforts to have all such
payments approved by a vote of the shareholders of the Company meeting the
requirements of the Code and the applicable treasury regulations (" _280G
Stockholder Approval_ "), in a manner intended to comply with Sections
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on any

any of the Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any
Proceeding or the assertion of any Proceeding by a Third Party or the
imposition of any claim, penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be
sought under _Section 9.02_ or _Section 9.03_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article
IX_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the Indemnifying Party
with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis, and
the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. All Third Party Claims properly set forth in a
notice shall remain outstanding until such Losses claimed therein have been
finally determined in accordance with the terms of this _Article IX_.

 

(i) The Indemnified Party shall have [***] from receipt of any such notice of
a Third Party Claim to give written notice to assume and control the defense,
appeal, or settlement proceedings thereof If notice to the effect set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense,
appeal, or settlement proceedings against the Third Party Claim with counsel
of its choice that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. So long
as the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense, appeal, or settlement
proceedings of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (A) the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of all
material events related to such Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in, but not control, the defense, appeal, or settlement proceedings of the
Third Party Claim, (C) the Indemnified Party shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise
disposing of any of the same, (D) the Indemnified Party shall not admit to any
wrongdoing by the Indemnifying Party, and (E) the Indemnified Party shall not
settle or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



78

    

As to any Third Party Claim with respect to which the Indemnified Party does
not assume control of the defense, the Indemnifying Party may, [***] from
receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim (or such earlier date on
which the Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party that the
Indemnified Party does not intend to assume control of the defense), assume
and control the defense, appeal, or settlement proceedings thereof and
thereafter (1) afford the Indemnified Party an opportunity to participate in
such defense, at its cost and expense and, at the Indemnified Partys
election at its sole cost and expense, with the separate co-counsel of its
choosing, (2) keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of all material
events related to such Third Party Claim, (3) the Indemnifying Party
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Indemnified Party
prior to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the same, and (4) not
settle or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed); _provided_ , that where the Indemnifying
Party is the Controlling Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle any Third Party Claim solely for monetary losses for which the
Indemnifying Party (x) is responsible for and pays 100% of the applicable
Losses under this _Article IX_ and (y) obtains a full written release of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (5) not admit to any
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party.

 

(ii) The Parties shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against,
settling, or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims. The Parties shall
also cooperate in any such defense, appeal, or settlement proceedings, and
give each other reasonable access to all documents and information relevant
thereto to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any
privilege of the Party controlling the proceedings (the " _Controlling Party_
") and subject to execution by the other party (the " _Non-Controlling
Party_") of the Controlling Partys standard non-disclosure agreement to the
extent that such materials contain confidential or proprietary information.

(b) _Access to Records for Third Party Claims_. The Non-Controlling Party
shall make available to the Controlling Party all books, records, and other
documents and materials that are under the direct control of the Controlling
Party and its controlled Affiliates or its Representatives and that the
Controlling Party reasonably considers necessary for the defense of such
matter, and cooperate in all reasonable ways with, and make its
Representatives reasonably available or otherwise render reasonable
assistance to, the Controlling Party and its Representatives, as applicable.
The Parties agree that under this _Section 9.04(b)_ and _Section 9.04(c)_,
any access by either Party to privileged communications of the other Party
does not break any applicable privilege and shall be deemed to be part of a
common legal interest, including the common interest privilege, joint defense
privilege, or other applicable privilege preserving such common legal
interest, such that privilege would not be waived by such access, and that
both Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates may assert
privilege to prevent the disclosure of communications among Purchaser, Seller
and their respective Representatives with respect to the negotiation,
documentation, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or dispute arising under this Agreement to any Third Party.

 

(c) _Other Claims_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than [***] after
an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") that
does not involve a Third Party Claim that might result in Losses for which
such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this _Article
IX_ , the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the Indemnifying Party stating: the nature, basis, the amount thereof
(to the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of
the final amount of such Direct Claim), the method of computation thereof (to
the extent known or estimated) and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Direct Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such Claim Notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that (A) the Indemnifying Party is
actually

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



79

    

prejudiced thereby or (B) such Claim Notice is not delivered prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 9.01_.
All Direct Claims properly set forth in a Claim Notice shall remain
outstanding until such Losses provided for therein have been finally
determined in accordance with the terms of this  _Article IX_.

(ii) Following receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall have [***] to make such investigation of the Direct
Claim as the Indemnifying Party reasonably deems necessary or desirable. For
the purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party agrees to make
available to the Indemnifying Party or its Representatives the information
relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct Claim and all
other information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys (or its controlled Affiliates) direct control that
the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests.

(iii) Within such [***] period, an Indemnifying Party may object to the Direct
Claim by delivering written notice to the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Partys objection (an " _Indemnification Objection Notice_ ").
Such Indemnification Objection Notice must describe the grounds for such
objection in reasonable detail. If an Indemnification Objection Notice is not
delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within [***]
after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the Claim Notice (the "
_Indemnification Objection Period_ "), such failure to so object shall be an
acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Article IX_ for the Losses set forth in
such Claim Notice to the extent not excluded from indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.05_ or limited pursuant to _Section 11.06_ and, without further
notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for the Losses
against the Indemnifying Party for such amount in any court having
jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

(iv) If an Indemnifying Party delivers an Indemnification Objection Notice
during the Indemnification Objection Period, the Indemnified Party shall have
[***] after its receipt of the Indemnification Objection Notice to respond in
a written statement to such objection. If, after such [***] period, there
remains a dispute as to any claims, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith for [***] (or any mutually
agreed upon extension thereof) thereafter to agree in writing upon the rights
of the respective Parties with respect to each of such claims. If no such
written agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, each of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to commence
arbitration in accordance with _Section 9.04(d)_ at any time after the
expiration of the [***] period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof)
for good faith negotiations.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (express or implied) herein, the
procedures in this _Section 9.04(c)_ shall not apply to the determination of
any Adjustment Amount, which shall be governed solely by _Section 2.05_.

 

(d) _Arbitration_. Any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection
with this _Article IX_ , including any claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , the determination of the scope and applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, or disputes concerning the propriety of the
commencement of the arbitration, (an " _Arbitrable Dispute_ ") shall be
finally settled by binding arbitration, and either the Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnified Party may commence arbitration Proceedings in accordance with
this _Section 9.04(d)_ and shall give written notice to that effect to the
other Party. Notwithstanding _Section 11.09_, the following shall be the
exclusive procedure for resolving any Arbitrable Dispute:

 

(i) The arbitration shall be seated in New York, New York and shall be
administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of
the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with its
International Arbitration Rules (the " _Arbitration Rules_ ") in effect at the
time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or
by agreement of the Parties. The language of the arbitration shall be
English. The arbitrators shall have the authority to grant any legal or
equitable remedies

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



80

    

that would be available if any judicial proceeding were instituted to resolve
an Arbitrable Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be
precluded from seeking provisional, interim or injunctive relief in any forum
of competent jurisdiction, and such action shall not be incompatible with the
agreement to arbitrate contained herein or the availability of interim
measures of protection under the Arbitration Rules. The existence and contents
of such arbitration and the terms of the Arbitrable Dispute shall be kept
confidential by the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Parties may
discuss the arbitration with those of their Representatives and Affiliates who
agree to keep the existence of such arbitration and the terms of such
Arbitrable Dispute confidential; and except (A) to the extent that disclosure
may be required of Party to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal
right, or enforce or challenge an award, (B) with the consent of all Parties,
(C) where such information is already in the public domain other than as
a result of the breach of this provision, (D) where needed for the
preparation or presentation of a claim or defense in this arbitration, or (E)
by order of the arbitration panel upon application of a Party.

 

(ii) The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators
appointed in the following manner: each Party shall, within [***] after the
commencement of the arbitration Proceedings, appoint an arbitrator, and such
arbitrators shall together, within [***] of the second arbitrators
appointment, and in consultation with the Parties, appoint a third arbitrator
as the chair of the arbitration panel. If any of the three arbitrators are
not appointed within the time prescribed above, then AAA shall appoint the
arbitrator(s) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.

 

(iii) All arbitrators shall be independent and impartial. No arbitrator shall
have any past or current family, business, or other relationship with the
Company, Seller, Purchaser, other Indemnified Party, or any of their
respective Affiliates unless, following full disclosure of all such
relationships, the parties to the Arbitrable Dispute agree in writing to waive
such requirement with respect to the arbitrator in connection with such
dispute.

(iv) The arbitrators shall render a reasoned award, and (A) shall include the
amount of the award to the Indemnified Party, if any, (B) shall be furnished
to Purchaser and Seller in writing, (C) shall constitute a final, non-
appealable, and conclusive determination of the issue(s) in question, and (D)
shall be binding upon Purchaser and Seller.

(v) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to act in good
faith to promptly exchange a reasonable number of relevant non-privileged
documents. The arbitrators shall be guided by the IBA Rules on the Taking of
Evidence in International Arbitration (2010) in matters related to disclosure
of information and the exchange of documents.

(vi) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each pay 50% of
the arbitrators and arbitration institutions initial fees and costs in any
such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and
regular administrative expenses of the arbitration Proceedings; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be
entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys fees and costs and (B) all costs
of arbitration, other than those provided for above, shall be paid by the
losing party, and the arbitrators shall be authorized to determine the
identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. Each Party shall
continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement pending final
resolution of any dispute resolution procedure.

 

(vii) The arbitrators chosen in accordance with these provisions shall not
have the power to alter, amend, or otherwise affect the terms of these
arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this _Section
9.04_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

(viii) Upon receipt of an arbitral award in accordance with this _Section
9.04_ then, subject in each case to the limitations contained in _Section
9.05_, Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall, within 10 Business Days
following receipt of the award of the arbitration panel (or such shorter
period as may

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



81

    

be set forth in such award), pay any amounts awarded thereunder to the other
Party. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

Section 9.05 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ unless the aggregate
liability for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees thereunder exceeds
$[***] (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
be entitled to recover only such Losses to the extent that the amount of such
Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that any individual claims (or in
the case of claims arising out of the same facts, events, or circumstances,
such claims in the aggregate) where the Losses relating thereto are less than
$[***] (the " _Mini-Basket_ ") shall be excluded and shall not be subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)_ and shall not be taken into account
in determining whether the Deductible has been met or exceeded; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Deductible and the Mini-Basket shall not
apply to claims for indemnification based upon Fraud or in respect of breaches
of, or inaccuracies in, any of the Seller Specified Representations, Company
Specified Representations, or Company Tax Representations;

(b) other than with respect to claims based upon Fraud, no Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)_ to the extent such Losses exceed the Escrow Fund, _plus_ an amount
equal to [***]% of any Milestone Payments earned under this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims for
indemnification in respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, any of the
Seller Specified Representations, Company Specified Representations, Company
Tax Representations, or Company IP Representations;

(c) other than with respect to claims arising out of or relating to _Section
9.02(g)_, no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for

indemnification hereunder to the extent that such Losses exceed the aggregate
amount of the Closing Payment, _plus_ an amount equal to [***]% of the
Milestone Payments earned under this Agreement;

 

(e) no Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.03_ to the extent that such
Losses exceed the aggregate amount of the Closing Payment and, if applicable,
any Contingent Payments earned under this Agreement;

 

(f) no Party shall have any liability for an otherwise indemnifiable Loss that
is contingent unless and until such contingent Loss becomes an actual Loss of
the Indemnified Party and is due and payable;

(g) in determining the amount of any indemnifiable Losses in respect of
the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty as of any
particular date (but not the inaccuracy in or breach of such representation or
warranty), "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality
qualifiers limiting the scope of such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded;

(h) no Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to double
recovery for any indemnifiable Losses even though such Losses may be
recoverable under more than one provision of this Agreement, and,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Purchaser Indemnitee shall
have any right to indemnification for any matter to the extent (i) the amount
of such matter was included in the Closing

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



82

    

Indebtedness, the Closing Transaction Expenses, or the Closing Current
Liabilities, and (ii) such amount was deducted for purposes of calculating
the Closing Payment, each as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.05_;

(i) the rights to indemnification provided under this _Article IX_ shall not
be affected by any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
Purchaser at any time (whether before or after the Closing), with respect to
any breach of or inaccuracy in, or compliance with, any of the
representations, warranties, or covenants of Seller or the Company contained
in this Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule);

 

(j) no Party shall be entitled to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.03(a)_ to the extent arising from (i) a
change in accounting or taxation Law, policy, or practice made after the
Closing, other than a change required to comply with any Law, policy, or
practice in effect on the date hereof, or (ii) any Law not in force on the
date hereof or any change in Law which takes effect retroactively or occurs as
a result of any increase in the rates of taxation in force on the date hereof;

 

(k) the waiver of any condition to the Closing based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to
indemnification under this _Article IX_ with respect to such representation or
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation; and

 

(l) no Purchaser Indemnitees, nor any of their Affiliates, shall have any
right to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to, or based on,
Taxes to the extent such Taxes (i) are attributable to any Tax period other
than a Tax period (or portion of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the
Closing Date, excluding the representations and warranties made in  _Section
4.11(e)_, _Section 4.11(h)_, _Section 4.11(i)_, or _Section 4.11(j)_, but
only for as long as the statute of limitations for any Pre-Closing Taxes are
open, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any Tax period (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses,
credits, or other Tax attributes from a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date, (iii) result from any transactions or actions
taken by the Purchaser Indemnitees or any of their Affiliates after the
Closing on the Closing Date, or (iv) were already taken into account in the
calculation of any payment by Seller under this Agreement, including
Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally determined
hereunder.

Section 9.06 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ shall be reduced by (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified
Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss (net of reasonable
costs and expenses actually incurred in recovering such insurance proceeds
with respect to such Loss), _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall be
under no obligation to pursue recovery under any insurance policies, and (ii)
any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party in the Tax year
that the Loss occurs and immediately succeeding [***] Tax years (" _Tax
Benefit_ "). Such Tax Benefit shall be paid over to the Indemnifying Party (to
the extent such Tax Benefit does not offset a claim) within 30 days after the
end of the relevant Tax period in which such Tax Benefit was
realized. Together with the payment described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Indemnified Party shall submit to the Indemnifying Party a
certification signed by the Indemnified Partys tax return preparer certifying
that the amount of the Tax Benefit paid for the relevant Tax year is accurate
and to the extent known whether future Tax Benefits are expected and the
amounts thereof.

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a Third Party in respect
of Losses that are the subject of indemnification hereunder, then the
Indemnified Party shall provide prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party of
such amount and a description of the basis for the payment of such amount by
the Third Party. After any portion of any Losses have been paid by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ ,

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



83

    

_ _ then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party
the excess (if any) of (i)(A) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such Losses _plus_  (B) the amount received by the Indemnified
Party from any Third Party in respect thereof, _over_ (ii) the full amount of
the Losses. __

 

Section 9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except for Fraud
claims under the Transaction Documents other than this Agreement and claims
pursuant to _Section 2.05_, the Parties sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ and the
remedies in _Section 11.14_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, after the
consummation of the Transactions, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
Transactions.

 

Section 9.08 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
_Article IX_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Closing Payment for Tax
purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.09 _Escrow Amount Deposit_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall, on
behalf of Seller, deposit into the account established by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement the Escrow Amount, as contribution to the
Escrow Fund, for the purpose of securing the Purchaser Indemnitees
indemnification under this _Article IX_ , which shall be governed under
the terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement. The
Parties agree that for Tax purposes, Purchaser shall be the owner of any cash
in the Escrow Fund, that all interest on or other taxable income, if any,
earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as earned by Purchaser, and
that no Taxes due on any interest earned thereon shall by paid from the Escrow
Fund, including by virtue of withholding Taxes by the Escrow Agent.

Section 9.10 _Right to Satisfy Indemnification Claims by Reducing Contingent
Payments; Order of Recovery_. 

(a) Subject to _Section 9.10(c)_, Purchaser is expressly authorized, but not
obligated, to set off up to [***]% of any Losses for which Purchaser
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder (subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ ), following final resolution of
the claims set forth in any Claim Notice or notice delivered pursuant to 
_Section 9.04(a)_, against any Contingent Payment or any other payments to be
made to Seller following the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 2.05_, if at the time any Contingent Payment is
due and payable there shall be any outstanding Claim Notice or notice
delivered pursuant to _Section 9.04(a)_, the amount of Losses with respect to
which shall not have been finally determined in accordance with this _Article
IX_ , then Purchaser shall be entitled, but not obligated, to withhold from
such Contingent Payment the amount of Losses that Purchaser Indemnitee
reasonably estimates in good faith to be subject to such notice. If the
amount of Losses for such notice, if any, is finally determined in accordance
with this _Article IX_ to be less than the amount withheld from such
Contingent Payment, then Purchaser shall promptly, and in any event within
five Business Days following the final determination of the amount of such
Losses, deliver the applicable difference corresponding to the applicable
portion of the Contingent Payment to Seller pursuant to  _Section 2.08_ plus
interest thereon at the Prime Rate _plus_ [***]%; _provided_ , _however_ , if
Seller can demonstrate that Purchaser has withheld such amounts in bad faith,
then the interest rate payable shall be the Late Payment Interest Rate. If
the amount of Losses for such claim, if any, is finally determined in
accordance with this _Article IX_ to exceed the amount by which such
Contingent Payment was reduced for such claim, then the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall continue to be entitled to indemnification for the amount
of such excess, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_.

(c) In the event the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
hereunder, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall seek recovery (i) from the Escrow
Fund, to the extent of the Escrow Amount then remaining, (ii) after the Escrow
Fund is exhausted or released, by offset against any Contingent Payment that
is due and payable, in accordance with _Section 9.10(a)_ and _Section
9.10(b)_, and (iii) only following exhaustion of such other recourse under (i)
and (ii), directly against Seller or any future Contingent Payment in
accordance with  _Section 9.10_.

Section 9.11 _Manner of Payment; Escrow Fund Releases_.

 

(a) The Escrow Fund shall be available to indemnify, compensate, and reimburse
the Purchaser Indemnitees for any Losses for which they entitled to recover
in accordance with the terms of this _Article IX_ , by release of funds to the
Purchaser Indemnitees from the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) On the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Amount then remaining in the
Escrow Fund (the " _Escrow Release Amount_ ") shall promptly be delivered to
Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that the Escrow
Fund shall not terminate with respect to any amount, which, in the reasonable
and good faith judgment of Purchaser is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Claim Notice or notice delivered pursuant to _Section
9.04(a)_ or _Article X_ , of which a copy has been provided to the Escrow
Agent on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date. As soon as any such claims
have been resolved, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly instruct the Escrow
Agent to deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund to Seller pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 10.01 _Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes imposed on either of Purchaser or
Seller or any of their Affiliates, including third parties acting as agents
or intermediaries, by reason of being treated for Swiss stamp duty Tax Law
purposes as a "Swiss securities dealer" shall be borne [***] under applicable
Swiss Law. All other Transfer Taxes shall be borne [***]. Each of Seller and
the Company shall cooperate in timely submitting all Tax Returns required to
be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes. The Seller, Company, or Purchaser, as
applicable, shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing requirements relating
to any such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Purchaser Tax Act. Purchaser covenants that it shall not commit, and
shall not cause or permit the Company or any of Purchasers Affiliates to
commit, any Purchaser Tax Act; _provided_ , _however_ , if Purchaser obtains a
Tax ruling or similar agreement from all required Taxing Authorities
concluding, to the satisfaction of the Seller, that there will be no increase
in Pre-Closing Taxes or other adverse impact on the Seller including resulting
in the Seller having to indemnify the Purchaser under the terms of
this Agreement as a result of Purchaser taking any action described in
clauses (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of the definition of Purchaser Tax Act, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to take such action, but only to the extent that
all required Taxing Authorities have determined that such action will not
give rise to any Pre-Closing Taxes or other adverse impact to Seller as
contemplated herein. Purchaser shall, at its expense, (i) prepare any ruling
or application described in this  _Section 10.01(b)_, (ii) submit said
ruling to Seller and its representative a reasonable period of time prior to
filing or submitting the ruling or application to a Taxing Authority, and
(iii) reflect any reasonable comments provided by Seller in the submission or
filing made to the Taxing Authority.

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



85

    

(c) _Tax Agreements_. Any and all Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreements
between the Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other,
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing
Date, the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to any
such agreement for any past or future period.

(d) _Redomicile or Liquidation Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in the event that Purchaser [***], Purchaser shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from (i) [***] or (ii) [***] (" _Redomicile Taxes_ ").

 

(e) _Cantonal Tax Ruling_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
apply for and seek to obtain from the [***] canton Tax Authorities a ruling,
confirming that [***] (the " _Cantonal Tax Ruling_ "). Seller shall provide a
copy of the draft Cantonal Tax Ruling to Purchaser for Purchasers review and
comment prior to submission and consider in good faith any comments provided
by Purchaser. Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser with a copy of the final
Cantonal Tax Ruling when received. If at any time following the Closing Date,
a party is provided with written notification by any Taxing Authority,
including without limitation, any Swiss federal or cantonal Taxing Authority,
that a determination was made contrary to the request in the Cantonal Tax
Ruling, such party shall promptly and within five days notify the other party
of such determination and provide a copy of any written notification or other
documents sent by the Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall control any Tax matter with respect
to the Cantonal Tax Ruling (regardless of whether the matter or
correspondence with the Taxing Authority is contentious) (the " _Cantonal Tax
Ruling Contest_ "), including, any determination made contrary to the request
in the Cantonal Tax Ruling, and all related correspondence, actions, defense,
and settlement involving a Taxing Authority with respect to such Cantonal Tax
Ruling Contest. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in accordance with
_Section 10.02(c)_with respect to any Cantonal Tax Ruling Contest, including
by granting any power of attorney or similar document required for Seller to
control the defense of any Cantonal Tax Ruling Contest. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary hereunder, and once a final determination that is
non-appealable is made with respect to any Cantonal Tax Ruling Contest, Seller
shall notify Purchaser of any adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant to
this Agreement. To the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of
this  _Section 10.01(e)_ and _Section 10.02(d)_ or _Section 9.04_, this
_Section 10.01(e) _shall control in all respects with respect to any Cantonal
Tax Ruling Contest.

 

Section 10.02 _Tax Filings and Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed), all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Company
on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes
of the Company due on or before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. At least 15 days prior to filing any
such Tax Return that is an income or other material Tax Return, the Company
shall submit a copy of each such Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchasers
review and comment and shall consider in good faith any comments timely
received from Purchaser.

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



86

    

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed), all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Tax
Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and shall timely
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon. All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Company with respect to such items,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. At least 30 days prior to
filing any such Tax Return, the Purchaser shall submit a copy of each such
Tax Return to Seller for Sellers review and approval. Purchaser shall accept
all comments submitted in writing by Seller on the final draft of the relevant
Tax Return filed with the relevant Taxing Authority for all Tax Returns for
Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. With respect to Straddle
Period Tax Returns, to the extent Seller provides comments to said Tax Returns
as contemplated herein and Purchaser disagrees with any Seller comments,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute and if
unable to do so, either party may submit the dispute for resolution to a
mutually agreed upon internationally recognized accounting firm ("Tax
Arbitrator"). The fees for the Tax Arbitrator shall be shared equally between
the parties. To the extent that a Straddle Period Tax Return must be filed
prior to the resolution of the Tax Arbitrator, it shall be so filed reflecting
Sellers position with respect to the Spinout Tax Treatment and consistent in
all respects with the Cantonal Tax Ruling. The Tax Arbitrators decision shall
be final and binding on the parties and reflected on the final Straddle Period
Tax Return, including any re-filed or amended Tax Return that must be filed
to reflect the determination of the Tax Arbitrator.

(b) _Straddle Tax Period Allocation_. In the case of any Straddle Tax Period,
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, sales, use, receipts,
or other similar items of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any
other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Tax Period that relate to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Tax Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Tax
Period (with the remaining amount of such Taxes for such Straddle Tax Period
allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period).

(c) _Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate (i) in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company and (ii) with respect to
any pending or threatened audit, assessment, Tax Contest, or other Proceeding
with respect thereto or to Taxes owed by the Company. Such cooperation shall
include maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary
in connection with Taxes and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder at the expense of the requesting Party. Purchaser,
the Company, and Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates (including the Company) to, (A) properly retain and maintain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Purchaser, any extensions thereof) and (B) allow the other
Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, at times and
dates mutually acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review, and make copies
of such records as may be necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at the expense of
the requesting Party. Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax of the Company or Purchaser that
could be imposed (including, with respect to the Transactions).
Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall, or shall the cause the
Company to, as applicable, grant Seller any power of attorney or similar
document (and prepare and execute any required documentation relating thereto)
under applicable Law that is required to carry out the intent of this
_Section 10.02(c)_, with regard to the Cantonal Tax Ruling, or Tax Contest
for which Seller has the right to control pursuant to _Section 10.02(d)_.

 



87

    

(d) _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section
9.04_ and subject to _Section 10.01(e)_, if any claim or demand for Taxes is
asserted or made for which Seller may be liable to indemnify Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates under this Agreement, including for any Tax matter relating
to the Spinout Tax Treatment (" _Tax Contest_ "), Purchaser shall notify
Seller of such Tax Contest within five Business Days of receipt thereof (
_provided_ , that no failure or delay of Purchaser in providing such notice
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent that Seller is materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay). Purchaser shall control any
Tax Contest;  _provided_ , that (i) Seller shall have the right to
participate in any such Tax Contest at the Sellers sole cost and expense,
(ii) Purchaser shall keep the Seller regularly informed of the conduct of said
Tax Contest, (iii) Purchaser shall provide Seller with all documents,
correspondence, worksheets, or similar items relating to the Tax Contest, and
(iv) Purchaser shall not settle such Tax Contest without Sellers consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

(e) _Refunds and Credits_. Any refund or credit of Taxes relating to the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period including any interest thereon shall
be for the account of Seller. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of any
such refund or credit and any interest thereon (net of any reasonable out of
pocket costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit) within
10 days of actual receipt of such Tax refund or credit thereof, as applicable.
Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, take
commercially reasonable efforts to file for, obtain, or cause the Company to
file for and obtain any refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under
this _Section 10.02(e)_. Purchaser shall control the prosecution of any such
refund claim; _provided_ , that (i) Seller shall have the right to
participate in any such refund claim at Sellers sole cost and expense, (ii)
Purchaser shall keep the Seller regularly informed of the conduct of such
refund claim, (iii) Purchaser shall provide Seller with all documents,
correspondence, worksheets or similar items relating to such refund claim, and
(iv) Purchaser shall not settle such refund claim without Sellers consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
If the Company as of the Closing Date has paid (or has caused to be paid)
estimated Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period
(including any overestimated Taxes included in Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses) in excess of the amount ultimately determined to be due
for the portion of such Tax Period ending on the Closing Date in the case of a
Straddle Tax Period, Purchaser shall promptly refund the portion of such
excess payment paid by Seller (and in the case of a Straddle Tax Period as
calculated pursuant to _Section 10.02(b)_ to Seller).

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) Any disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect
to a particular representation or warranty contained herein shall be deemed
to be a disclosure with respect to all other representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement if the applicability of such disclosure to any
other representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is intended to qualify such representation or
warranty. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden
the scope of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement.

 

(b) No reference to or disclosure of any matter or item in this Agreement or
in the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such matter or item is material or that such matter or item is
required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, nor shall it be
deemed to establish a standard of materiality now or in the future (it
being the intent that none of the Company,

 



***Certain Confidential Information Omitted

  



90

    

Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates shall be penalized for having
disclosed more than may be required by the request); (ii) represents a
determination by the Company or any of its Affiliates that such matter or item
did not arise in the ordinary course; (iii) shall imply that such matter or
item constitutes or would result in a Material Adverse Effect by the criteria
set forth in this Agreement; or (iv) shall imply that disclosure of any such
matter or item is required by Law or by any Governmental Entity. Without
limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law, or Judgment shall be construed as an
admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

 

Section 11.06 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
in no event shall any Party (other than any such amounts paid directly to a
Third Party in connection with a Third Party Claim) be liable or entitled to
recover in connection with this Agreement for special or indirect (to
the extent unforeseeable) or exemplary, or punitive damages, for lost or
anticipated profits, revenues, or opportunities or business interruption, or
for any damages calculated by reference to a multiplier of revenue, profits,
earnings, or similar methodology, whether or not reasonably foreseeable.

Section 11.07 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and
if the rights or obligations of either Party under this Agreement shall not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid, and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and reasonably acceptable to the Parties.

 

Section 11.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract, tort, or statute) that may be based upon, arise
out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York, including its statutes of limitations, without
regard to the conflict of Laws rules of such state that would result in the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 11.09  _Jurisdiction_. Except as provided in _Section 2.05_,
_Section 9.04(d)_, _Section 11.10_, and any action to enforce an arbitral
award, each Party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding against it arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or disputes
relating hereto, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct, or
otherwise, shall be brought exclusively in any New York State court, or
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in New York, New York,
and any appellate court from any thereof (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_
"), and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of the Chosen Courts _in personam_ with respect to any such
Proceeding and waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law any objection
that it may now or hereafter have that any such Proceeding has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

 

Section 11.10 _Arbitrable Claims_. Any claim for indemnification,
compensation, or reimbursement pursuant to _Article IX_ and any claim or
dispute arising out of, in connection with or related to _Section 2.07_ or
otherwise related to any Contingent Payment or as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement shall be brought and finally resolved (and any
claim made after the Closing based upon Fraud arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions may be brought and finally resolved)
by arbitration in accordance with _Section 9.04(d)_, and _Section 9.04(d)_
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the resolution of any dispute under
_Section 2.07_.

 



91

    

Section 11.11 _Service of Process_. Each of the Parties consents to service of
any process, summons, notice, or document that may be served in any
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts, which service may be made by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, or as otherwise provided in _Section
11.04_, to such Partys address set forth in _Section 11.04_.

Section 11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, OR DISPUTES
(OTHER THAN DISPUTES GOVERNED BY _SECTION 9.04(D)_) RELATING HERETO. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 11.12_. 

Section 11.13 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, or superseded, and any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties, or conditions hereof may be waived only by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by or on
behalf of the Party waiving compliance. No course of dealing between
the Parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of any right hereunder or of the failure to
perform or of a breach by any other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any
other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by any other Party
whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided
herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by
applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.

Section 11.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the
Acquisition) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which it is entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the
right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and
without that right, none of the Company, Seller, or Purchaser would have
entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law, or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have
an adequate remedy at law. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this  _Section 11.14_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 11.15 _Joint Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship
of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 11.16 _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall
be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together
shall constitute but one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature 

 



92

    

 page of this Agreement by email or other means of electronic transmission
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed original counterpart of
this Agreement.

 

Section 11.17 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Escrow Agreement, and the other Transaction Documents
delivered in connection herewith or therewith or otherwise in connection with
the Transactions, contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the Transactions and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
promises, and representations, whether written or oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 11.18 _No Recourse_.

 

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or suit based
upon, arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement may only be brought against the
named Parties to this Agreement and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to the named Parties to this
Agreement (in all cases, as limited by the applicable provisions of _Article
IX_ ).

(b) The Trustee has executed this Agreement solely as trustee and with the
intention of binding the Trust. Except in the case of gross negligence or
Fraud by the Trustee and notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement:

 

(i) the aggregate of all liabilities of the Trustee under this Agreement in
respect of the Trust shall at all times and for all purposes be limited to
the assets of the Trust;

(ii) in no circumstances shall any liability attach to, or be enforced or
enforceable against, the assets of the Trustee (held in its personal capacity
or in any other capacity whatsoever) other than the assets which comprise the
Trust; and

 

(iii) all representations, warranties, undertakings, obligations, and
covenants in this Agreement are made, given, owed, or agreed by, or
in relation to, the Trust and in the Trustees capacity as trustee of the
Trust and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be construed to be made,
given, owed, or agreed by, or in relation to, the Trustee in its capacity as
trustee of any other trust or in its personal capacity or in any other
capacity whatsoever;

_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, in no circumstances shall any Party have recourse to any
assets held by the Trustee as trustee of any other trust or held by the
Trustee in a fiduciary capacity for any Person.
