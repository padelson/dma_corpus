2.7 Post-Closing Adjustments.

 

(a) _Closing Balance Sheet_.

 

(i) _Preparation of Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_. At least five (5) days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an
estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
which Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP and in a manner consistent with the Companys past practices setting
forth its good faith estimate of the calculation of (i) the unpaid Debt as of
the Effective Time (the " _Estimated_

 



24   _Closing Debt_ "), (ii) the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of the Effective
Time (the " _Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), (iii) the
consolidated Cash of the Centerre Companies as of the Effective Time (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (iv) the Net Working Capital as of the
Effective Time. In connection with the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet, the Company shall provide to Parent such information, detail
and support as Parent shall reasonably request.

(ii) _Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet_. As promptly as practicable, but
in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative the Closing Balance Sheet setting forth its calculation of (i)
the unpaid Debt as of the Effective Time, (ii) the unpaid Transaction Expenses
as of the Effective Time, (iii) the consolidated Cash of the Centerre
Companies as of the Effective Time and (iv) the Net Working Capital as of the
Effective Time, which Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the Companys past practice. Parent
shall provide the Stockholder Representative and its representatives
reasonable access at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the
records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work
paper access letters if requested) auditors of the Company relating to
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel of
the Company to reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in
connection with its review of the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

(iii) _Closing Balance Sheet Disputes_. The Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-
Owner Participants, may dispute the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_ by sending a written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to Parent within twenty (20) Business Days of Parents delivery of
such Closing Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative. The Dispute
Notice shall identify each disputed item on the Closing Balance Sheet, specify
the amount of such dispute and set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such dispute. In the event of such a dispute, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their differences, and
any resolution by them as to any disputed items shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties and shall be evidenced by a writing signed by
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, including, as appropriate, a
revised Closing Balance Sheet (a " _Revised Closing Balance Sheet_ ")
reflecting such resolution. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to reach such resolution by the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following
delivery of the Dispute Notice by the Stockholder Representative to Parent
(the " _Resolution Deadline_ "), then Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly submit any remaining disputed items for final
binding resolution to Grant Thornton LLP, or if Grant Thornton LLP
is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, to such other a nationally-
or regionally-recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Stockholder Representative (which accounting firm has not,
within the prior sixty (60) months thereto, provided services to Parent or
any Centerre Company or any of their respective Affiliates for an aggregate
amount in excess of $100,000 (hereinafter referred to as the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ ")). Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the Final Closing Balance
Sheet as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Independent
Accounting Firm to render a determination within sixty (60) days after its
retention. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts described in the Dispute Notice to which Parent and the Stockholder
Representative were unable to agree upon prior to the retention of the
Independent Accounting Firm. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination of the disputed items shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (
_i.e_., not on an independent review) and on the applicable definitions and
sections in this Agreement related to the Closing Balance Sheet. The
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties

 



25  and a Revised Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared reflecting such
determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm and, if applicable, those
disputed items which were resolved by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative prior to the retention of the Independent Accounting Firm. The
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne (and
paid) by the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-
Owner Participants based on their Pro Rata Shares (or at the Stockholder
Representatives discretion, from the Stockholder Representative Reserve) or
Parent, as applicable, depending on whether the Executing Stockholders, the
Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants or Parent, as applicable,
are determined to be less successful in advancing their respective case, as
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm based upon the success or
failure (in terms of percentages) of such Partys claims, as determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm. For example, if the final determination
reflects a 60%-40% determination of the Parties claims pursuant to which the
Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants are deemed to be 60% successful, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall allocate 60% of the expenses to Parent and 40% of the expenses to the
Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-
Owner Participants.

(iv) _Final Closing Balance Sheet_. The Closing Balance Sheet or, if it has
been adopted or finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_, the
Revised Closing Balance Sheet, as appropriate, shall be deemed to be final,
binding and conclusive on Parent and the Executing Stockholders, the Executing
Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants (the " _Final Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") upon the earliest of (A) the failure of the Stockholder
Representative to deliver to Parent the Dispute Notice by the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following Parents delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative; (B) the resolution of all
disputes by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, as evidenced by, if
appropriate, a Revised Closing Balance Sheet certified in writing by the
Stockholder Representative and Parent; or (C) the resolution of all disputes
by the Independent Accounting Firm, and, if applicable, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_, as
evidenced by written certification by the Stockholder Representative and
Parent including, if appropriate, a Revised Closing Balance Sheet. Subject
to  _Section 2.7(b)(ix)_, any adjustment of the Merger Consideration based
on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be made on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the "
_Adjustment Payment Date_ ") in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_ below. The
unpaid Debt as of the Effective Time as reflected in the Final Closing Balance
Sheet is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Debt_ ". The unpaid
Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time as reflected in the Final
Closing Balance Sheet is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Transaction Expenses_ ". The consolidated Cash of the Centerre Companies as
of the Effective Time as reflected in the Final Closing Balance Sheet is
referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Cash_ ".

 

(b) _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustments_. Upon the Final Closing
Balance Sheet being deemed final, binding and conclusive in accordance with
_Section 2.7(a)_ hereof, adjustments to the Merger Consideration as a result
of the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall
be made as follows:

 

(i) In the event that (A) the sum of the Net Working Capital reflected on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet exceeds (B) Fourteen Million Dollars
($14,000,000) (such amount, the " _Working Capital Surplus_ "), then Parent
shall be obligated to pay to the Stockholder Representative (or its designee)
for further distribution to the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option
Holders and Non-Owner Participants on the Adjustment Payment Date an amount in
cash equal to the Working Capital Surplus, in immediately available funds by

Stockholder Representative;

 



26 (ii) In the event that (A) the sum of the Net Working Capital reflected on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet is less than (B) Twelve Million Dollars
($12,000,000) (such amount, the " _Working Capital Deficiency_ "), then the
Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants shall be obligated, severally based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares, to pay Parent on the Adjustment Payment Date an amount in cash equal
to the Working Capital Deficiency, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to the bank account specified in writing by Parent;

(iii) If the Final Closing Debt is greater than the Estimated Closing Debt,
then the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants shall be obligated, severally based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares, to pay the amount equal to such difference to Parent;

 

(iv) If the Final Closing Debt is less than the Estimated Closing Debt, then
Parent shall be obligated to pay the amount equal to such difference to the
Stockholder Representative (or its designee) for further distribution to the
Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants;

 

(v) If the Final Closing Transaction Expenses are greater than the Estimated
Closing Transaction Expenses, then the Executing Stockholders, the Executing
Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants shall be obligated, severally based
on their respective Pro Rata Shares, to pay the amount equal to such
difference to Parent;

 

(vi) If the Final Closing Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated
Closing Transaction Expenses, then Parent shall be obligated to pay the
amount equal to such difference to the Stockholder Representative (or its
designee) for further distribution to the Executing Stockholders, the
Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants;

 

(vii) If the Final Closing Cash is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash,
then Parent shall be obligated to pay the amount equal to such difference to
the Stockholder Representative (or its designee) for further distribution to
the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants;

 

(viii) If the Final Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Cash, then
the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants shall be obligated, severally based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares, to pay the amount equal to such difference to Parent; and

 

(ix) Any adjustments to the Merger Consideration and required payments between
Parent and the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-
Owner Participants pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be netted against
each other as applicable. Any net amounts then due by the Executing
Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants hereunder shall first be paid from the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
provided that if the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy the
full amount due under this _Section 2.7(b)_ to Parent, then Parent shall next
recover the remaining amount due under this _Section 2.7(b)_ from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement, and if the Indemnification Amount is insufficient to
satisfy the remaining amount due under this _Section 2.7(b)_ to Parent, then
Parent may seek the remaining amount due under this _Section 2.7(b)_ directly
from the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants severally based on their respective Pro Rata Shares; _provided_
, _however_ , that any amount so recovered by Parent shall be disregarded for
purposes of the Indemnification Cap. The Executing Stockholders hereby
acknowledge and agree that the payment of the net amount owed by Parent under
this _Section 2.7(b)_, if any, to the Stockholder Representative (or its
designee) for the benefit of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing

 



27  Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants satisfies Parents obligation, if

the Stockholder Consent and the executed Letters of Transmittal and Voting
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.14_, shall have approved this
Agreement and the Merger and shall have waived any and all rights that they

for their Company Shares in accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, those Company Shares which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a
Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL.
If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such rights, such holders Company Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the portion
of the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without
interest thereon. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to retain
any portion of the Merger Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting
Shares pending resolution of the claims of such Dissenting Stockholders, and
no holder of Company Shares shall be entitled to any portion of such retained
Merger Consideration. The Company and the Stockholder Representative shall

advised by the IRS or Department of Labor of any plan defects in its form or
operation; to the Companys Knowledge, no circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in revocation of such favorable determination
letter, if any, or the loss of the Employee Benefit Plans tax qualified
status. Each Target Entity and its ERISA Affiliates have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under each
Employee Benefit Plan and applicable Law (including ERISA, the Code and the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Each Employee Benefit Plan,
including any associated trust or fund, has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable Law, and, to
the Companys Knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject any
Target Entity to a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or to an excise tax
under the Code, or that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to
subject any Target Entity, any Employee Benefit Plan, or any participant in,

extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
reflected in the Financial Statements.

 

(e) There is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened Action
relating to any Employee Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits
provided by the Employee Benefit Plans and domestic relations orders. To the
Companys Knowledge, no Employee Benefit Plan is the subject of an examination
or audit by a Governmental Authority, is the subject of an application or
filing under, or is a participant in, any government-sponsored amnesty,
voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program, except as set forth
in _Schedule 5.13(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 



49 (f) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.13(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, no
Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health,
life or disability insurance or other welfare benefits (within the meaning of
ERISA Section 3(1)) to current or former employees of any Target Entity for
any period extending beyond retirement or other termination of employment,
except (i) as required by applicable Law, including, without limitation, Code
Section 4980B, Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA and similar provisions of
applicable state Law, (ii) conversion rights, and (iii) disability benefits
attributable to a disability occurring prior to retirement or other
termination of employment. The Target Entities and their ERISA Affiliates are
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
(i) Code Section 4980B, Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and any similar state
Law, (ii) HIPAA and (iii) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and
the regulations thereunder (the " _Affordable Care Act_ ").

(g) The Company has provided Parent a list of all "qualified beneficiaries"
(as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) who are covered by, or eligible
for, COBRA continuation coverage. As of the Closing, the Company will provide
an updated list of all such beneficiaries through the Closing Date.

 

(h) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.13(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,
none of the Target Entities nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any other Person
has engaged with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan in a "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code for which a statutory or administrative exemption does not exist,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in any such prohibited transaction.

 

(i) No Employee Benefit Plan is established and maintained outside the United
States, is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States, or provides compensation or benefits to any current or former
employee, director, consultant or independent contractor of any Target Entity
(or any dependent of any such Person) that are subject to the laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States.

(j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.13(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of

any additional or subsequent event(s)) will (i) entitle any individual to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment from any Target
Entity, Parent (or its Affiliate), or any Employee Benefit Plan, (ii)
otherwise increase the amount of compensation due to any individual or forgive
any debt owed by any individual, (iii) result in any benefit or right
becoming established or increased, or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of any benefit (including, without limitation, with regard to the
ownership interests of any Target Entity) under any Employee Benefit Plan,
except to the extent required by Code Section 411(d)(3), or (iv) require any
Target Entity or Parent to transfer or set aside any assets to fund or
otherwise provide for any benefits for any Person.

 

(k) Each Target Entity and each of the Benefit Plans has properly classified
individuals providing services to any Target Entity as independent
contractors or employees, as the case may be.

(l) Each Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in whole or in part
a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code is evidenced by a writing that complies in form and has been
operated and maintained in a manner that complies with the applicable 

 



50  requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable provisions of
United States Treasury Regulations and other IRS guidance, and no additional
tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is reasonably
expected to be incurred by any participant in any such Employee Benefit Plan.

(m) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" under the
Affordable Care Act (i) is in material compliance with the group market
reforms and employer shared responsibility provisions of the Affordable Care
Act and (ii) is preparing to determine and offer coverage to full-time
employees as required to avoid the excise taxes under Section 4980H of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder effective January 1, 2015
(or such date in 2015 that is fully compliant with the transition relief
under the final regulations for non-calendar year plans and identified on
Schedule 5.13(m) of the Disclosure Schedules). Each Target Entitys group
health plan employs the standard measurement and stability periods, as set
forth on Schedule 5.13(m) of the Disclosure Schedules, for purposes of
determining any employer shared responsibility penalties. The Company is not
aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause it or any other Target
Entity to be potentially subject to fines, penalties or sanctions under the
provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

5.14 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14_ of the
Disclosure Schedules:

(a) Each Target Entity has been and continues to be in compliance in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to their operations
and to their use of any owned or leased Real Property, including, but not

Laws for the continued operation of its business.

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no current
facts, circumstances or conditions arising out of or relating to the Target

operated real property that would reasonably be expected to result in any
Target Entity incurring material liability under any Environmental Laws,
including, but not limited to, with regard to the Release, threatened Release,
presence, handling, generation, transport, storage, disposal or treatment of

with applicable Environmental Laws and the Real Property Leases, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no release of any Hazardous
Substance by any of the Target Entities at or on any owned or leased real
property that requires notification, investigation, remediation or other
action by the Target Entities pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law.

_Section 7.2_ shall affect any obligations, representations or warranties of
the Executing Stockholders and the Company or the right of Parent to rely on
the representations and warranties of the Executing Stockholders and the
Company set forth in _Article V_.

 



58 7.3 Conduct of the Executing Stockholders. During the period from the date
hereof and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, no Executing Stockholder shall (a) transfer all or any
portion of its Company Shares (other than to another Executing Stockholder or
an Affiliate of Executing Stockholder who shall sign a joinder to this
Agreement) or (b) permit any Encumbrance on any of its Company Shares without
the prior written consent of Parent.

 

7.4 Certain Tax Matters.

 

(a) If any taxable period of a Centerre Company (with respect to any Income
Taxes) begins prior to the Effective Time but does not terminate on the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Parties will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat
the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period
ending on or as of the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ "),
and such short taxable period shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
purposes of this Agreement. In any instance where applicable Law does not
permit such an election to be made, then for purposes of this Agreement, the
amount of such Taxes that relates to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be
computed as if the entire Straddle Period ended on or as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any credits, allowances or similar Tax
attributes that are properly allocable to the entire Straddle Period shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period based on the number of calendar
days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period relative to the total number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period.

(b) Parent shall cause the Company to timely and properly prepare and file,
after giving the Stockholder Representative the opportunity to review and
reasonably approve, all Income Tax Returns of the Centerre Companies for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, to the extent such Return was not filed prior to
the Effective Time, including for those jurisdictions and Governmental
Authorities that permit or require a short period Return for Income Taxes. The
Stockholder Representative shall review and provide any comments to such
Returns as soon as reasonably practical, but in no event later than twenty
(20) days following receipt of such Return. The Stockholder Representative and
the Company shall act in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to a
Return as soon as reasonably practical. If the Stockholder Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days
following the Stockholder Representatives receipt of the applicable Return,
the Stockholder Representative and the Company shall submit such remaining
disagreements to the Independent Accounting Firm, to be selected in the manner
provided in _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_. The Independent Accounting Firm shall then
resolve and determine such disputed items in the manner provided in _Section
2.7(a)(iii)_, except that references therein to the "Final Closing Balance
Sheet" shall be deemed to be references to such Return, and the reference
therein to "applicable definitions and sections in this Agreement related to
the Final Closing Balance Sheet" shall be deemed to be a reference to this
_Section 7.4_ and the definitions and schedules related hereto. The
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties and judgment may be entered on such decision in a
court of competent jurisdiction. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm in resolving the disputed items shall be borne in the
manner provided in _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_. Not later than three (3) Business
Days following the final resolution of any Return related to Pre-Closing Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in accordance with this _Section 7.4(b)_,
and provided that such Pre-Closing Taxes were not reflected in the Final
Closing Balance Sheet or previously paid pursuant to an indemnification claim
under _Article IX_ hereto, Parent shall be entitled to payment in an amount
equal to the amount of the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on the applicable Return
as being chargeable to the Executing Stockholders pursuant to this _Section
7.4_ in accordance with the terms, and subject to the limitations, set forth
in _Article IX_ of this Agreement, which payment Parent shall, or shall cause
the Company to, remit to the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to
such Taxes.

 



59 (c) Any net Income Tax refunds that are actually received by Parent or a
Centerre Company, and any amounts actually credited against Income Taxes to
which Parent or a Centerre Company become entitled after the Closing Date,
which relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, shall be for the account of the
Executing Stockholders. Parent shall pay to the Stockholder Representative
(or its designee) for the benefit of the Executing Stockholders any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 

(d) Whenever any taxing authority, in writing, asserts a claim, makes an
assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Income Taxes for which the
Executing Stockholders are or may be liable under this Agreement or otherwise,
Parent shall inform the Stockholder Representative within fifteen (15)
Business Days of such assertion and the Stockholder Representative shall have
the right to participate in any resulting proceedings and to approve, the
settlement of any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such
proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Income Taxes for which the
Executing Stockholders may be liable under this Agreement or otherwise.

(e) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.4(d)_ above, Parent and the Executing
Stockholders shall each cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Returns
pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to any Income Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Company (before the Closing) and Parent (after the
Closing) shall each cause each Centerre Company (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Income Tax matters pertinent to each Centerre
Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Effective Time
until the expiration of the statutory period of limitations of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other Party so requests, the Executing Stockholders or
Parent, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of
such books and records and the Party taking possession of such books and
records agrees to keep the information therein confidential with respect to
third parties.

(f) Parent and the Stockholder Representative further agree, upon request, to
use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Tax period following the
Closing.

(g) All sales, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other
similar Taxes, together with interest, additions or penalties with respect
thereto resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the Executing Stockholders.

7.5 Announcement. Without the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, each
Party agrees that, it will not, and will direct its representatives, agents,
Affiliates and employees not to, disclose to any Person (other than its
representatives, agents, Affiliates and employees who have a need to know and
who similarly agree to be bound by this confidentiality provision) any facts
relating to this Agreement and the discussions, negotiations and any
agreements or understandings reached by the Parties related to this Agreement
and prior to the request for such prior written consent and upon at least
forty-eight (48) hours to review and comment on any such proposed disclosure,
the disclosing Party shall provide the other Party with a draft of
the proposed disclosure prior to the distribution thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may

 



60  disclose the execution of this Agreement and/or the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, as required under applicable
Law, provided that (i) Parent gives the Company and the Stockholder
Representative prior written notice of any such disclosure and a draft of the
proposed disclosure prior to the distribution thereof with at least forty-
eight (48) hours to review and comment on any such proposed disclosure and
(ii) such disclosure does not include any information (including, without
limitation, quotations or other statements for marketing purposes) that is not
required under such applicable Law, in the reasonable determination of Parent
after consultation with its securities counsel.

7.6 Non-Negotiation Period. During the period from the date hereof
and continuing until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement, (the " _Non-Negotiation Period_ "), the Company
and each Executing Stockholder shall not, and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, and each of the Company and the Executing
Stockholders shall cause its, his or her (as applicable) respective
representatives not to:

 

(a) negotiate or discuss acquisition terms or conditions, or participate in
any negotiations or discussions to discuss acquisition terms or conditions,
with any other potential acquirer of any Target Entity, any Target Entity
Operation, the Assets or the Company Shares;

(b) solicit or encourage submission of any proposal or offer to acquire or
lease all or any portion of any Target Entity, any Target Entity Operation,
the Assets or the Company Shares;

 

(c) furnish to any person other than Parent and its representatives any
confidential information regarding any Target Entity, any Target Entity
Operation or the Assets except as required by Law, to satisfy the obligations
of the Executing Stockholders, the Company and each of the Target Entities
pursuant to _Section 7.1_, or in the ordinary course of business of the
Target Entities; or

(d) assist or participate in any proposal or offer from any person other than
Parent, to acquire or lease all or any substantial portion of any Target
Entity, any Target Entity Operation, the Assets or the Company Shares, other
than a JV Partner set forth on _Schedule 7.16_ with respect to the sale or
purchase of a Centerres Companys or such JV Partners interest in a Joint
Venture set forth on _Schedule 7.16_.

If, during the Non-Negotiation Period, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives, receives any
unsolicited offer or proposal from any Person other than Parent to acquire or
lease all or any substantial portion of any Target Entity, any Target Entity
Operation, the Assets or the Company Shares, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing of its receipt of such offer or proposal and of the
material terms thereof.

 

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.6_ shall
prohibit or otherwise limit (x) the transfer of any Company Shares from any
Executing Stockholder to any other Executing Stockholders or to any Affiliate
of such Executing Stockholder who signs a joinder to this Agreement, or (y)
any actions (or omissions) in anticipation of or preparation for any debt
refinancing of the Company or any other Target Entity or any acquisition by
the Company or any other Target Entity, provided that none of the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall enter into any binding commitment to consummate any
such transaction without the prior written consent of Parent.

7.7 Termination of Employee Benefit Plans; 280G Approval.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
the terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plans (including any underlying
insurance policies or service agreements), Parent may request the Company to
terminate prior to the Effective Time certain current

 



61  Employee Benefit Plans of the Centerre Companies set forth on _Schedule 7.7_
, as updated as of the Effective Time, any such updates to _Schedule 7.7_ to
be provided as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing.
Each current Employee Benefit Plan of the Centerre Companies that is not so
terminated shall be amended to the extent necessary to provide that no
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than a Centerre Company
shall participate therein on or after the Effective Time unless Parent
explicitly authorizes such participation. The Company shall cause
the applicable Centerre Company to adopt resolutions and take all other
actions necessary to effect the termination or amendment of all such current
Employee Benefit Plans of the Centerre Companies referenced above to be
effective no later than the Effective Time and shall provide to Parent
evidence of the adoption of such resolutions by the board of directors or
other authorized person(s) on behalf of the applicable Centerre Company.

 

(b) On or before December 31, 2014, the Company shall (i) amend the Centerre
Healthcare Corporation 401(k) Plan (the " _Plan_ ") to suspend safe harbor
contributions as of December 31, 2014, under the Plan and provide such
amendment to Parent at least three (3) business days prior to adoption; and
(ii) refrain from sending the safe harbor notice to participants for the 2015
plan year (or, if the 2015 safe harbor notice has already been sent to
participants, to revoke such notice by subsequent notice). The Company may
provide in such Plan amendment that the Company (A) will make a fixed
nonelective contribution of 3% to eligible participants with characteristics
correlating to prior years safe harbor contributions (i.e., fully vested when
made and subject to distribution limitations), provided that such Plan
amendment makes explicit that such provision may be subsequently amended at
any time without advance notice to participants (which subsequent amendment
the Company shall adopt upon Parents request); or (B) that the Company
may make discretionary nonelective contributions to the Plan in 2015, the
amount of which may be determined at a future date.

(c) If requested by Parent, the Company will, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, (i) secure from each Person who
has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (hereafter, " _Section 280G_")) a waiver
of such Persons rights to all of such payments and/or benefits to the minimum
extent necessary (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable to such Person
so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such Person
shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G), and (ii) solicit the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, to the extent and in a manner required under Code Sections
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, of any Waived 280G Benefits and other potential payments and/or
benefits that, if paid or made by the Company could, in the absence of the
approval described in this _Section 7.7(c)_ constitute "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G (" _Other Benefits_ "). If any of
the Waived 280G Benefits or Other Benefits fail to be approved by the
stockholders of the Company as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits
and Other Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the Companys
stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.7(c)_ and that either (iii) the requisite number of stockholder
votes was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits and Other
Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (iv) that the 280G Approval was not
obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits and the Other
Benefits shall not be made or provided.

 



62 7.8 Stockholder Representative.

 

(a) The Executing Stockholders hereby appoint and designate the Stockholder
Representative as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf
of the Executing Stockholders to give and receive any and all notices and
communications under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
notices and communications pursuant to _Article IX_ ) and the other
Transaction Documents, to otherwise act on behalf of the Executing
Stockholders as provided in, or required by, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and distribute it in accordance with this Agreement, to
enter into the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Executing Stockholders, to
agree to the Estimated Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Balance Sheet, to
participate in and agree to the adjustment process set forth in _Section
2.7_, to waive any condition to the Executing Stockholders obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated under _Sections 8.1_ or _8.3_ , to
agree to, negotiate, prosecute, defend, enter into settlements and
compromises of, or take any other action with respect to any indemnification
claims by or against any of the Executing Stockholders under this Agreement,
demand arbitration and comply with Orders of Governmental Authorities and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to negotiate, execute and
deliver amendments to this Agreement if the Stockholder Representative
receives consent to enter into such amendment by Executing Stockholders
holding a majority of the Company Shares held by all Stockholders on an as
converted to Common Stock basis and such amendment does not adversely affect
the rights, benefits or obligations of an Executing Stockholder without
adversely affecting the rights, benefits or obligations of all other
Executing Stockholders in a substantially similar manner, to execute, date and
deliver the Transaction Documents, to use the Stockholder Representative
Reserve in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of
its authority hereunder, to retain funds for reasonably anticipated expenses
and liabilities to the extent the Stockholder Representative Reserve is not
sufficient, and to take all other actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have no obligation to act
on behalf of the Executing Stockholders, except as expressly provided herein
and in the other Transaction Documents. Such agency may be changed by the
holders of a majority in interest of the Executing Stockholders (based on
their portion of the Company Shares to be sold hereunder on an as if
converted to Common Stock basis) from time to time upon not less than ten (10)
days prior written notice to Parent. The powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Stockholder Representative Group hereunder:
(i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Executing
Stockholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii)
shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Executing Stockholder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Indemnification
Escrow Amount. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative.
Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Executing Stockholders.

(b) Certain Executing Stockholders have entered into a letter agreement (the
" _Stockholder Representative Agreement_ ") with the Stockholder
Representative for certain representatives of such Executing Stockholders (the
" _Advisory Group_ ") to provide direction to the Stockholder Representative
in connection with the performance of its services under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents. Neither the Stockholder Representative
(together with its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees) nor any member of the Advisory Group or its Affiliates
(including, the Executing Stockholders appointing such Advisory Group)
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Group_ ") shall be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative or in its
capacity as the Advisory Group while acting in good faith and without willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of good faith. The Executing
Stockholders shall severally, based on such Executing Stockholders Pro Rata
Share, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative
Group against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, cost, fine, judgment,
amount paid in settlement or expense (including fees, disbursements and costs
of counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers) incurred without bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising
out of or in connection with the

 



63  acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Expenses_ "). Such
Stockholder Representative Expenses shall be recovered first, from the
Stockholder Representative Reserve, second, from any distribution of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount otherwise distributable to the Executing
Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants at
the time of distribution (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares), and
third, directly from the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders
and Non-Owner Participants (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares). The
immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Stockholder Representative or any member of the Stockholder
Representative Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The Executing Stockholders acknowledge that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges
or administration of its duties.

(c) The Stockholder Representative will hold the Stockholder Representative
Reserve separate from its corporate funds and will not voluntarily make it
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Stockholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Stockholder Representative Reserve other than as a result of
its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Stockholder Representative Reserve,
and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder.

 

(d) In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party receives payment from the
remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount and/or Indentified Matters Escrow
Amount as a result of an indemnification claim against an Executing
Stockholder (such Executing Stockholder being referred to herein as the "
_Breaching Stockholder_ ") pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ of this
Agreement (any such payment being referred to herein as a " _Disproportionate
Payment_ "), each Executing Stockholder agrees that the Stockholder
Representative, at its election, shall be entitled to (i) withhold from any
amounts otherwise due to such Breaching Stockholder under this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents (including, without limitation, the portion of the
Escrow Amount and the Stockholder Representative Reserve that would have
otherwise been released to such Breaching Stockholder) an amount equal to the
Disproportionate Payment and any costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Stockholder Representative in connection with such
Disproportionate Payment or (ii) require such Breaching Stockholder to pay an
amount equal to the Disproportionate Payment, plus all costs, fees and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Stockholder Representative in
connection with such Disproportionate Payment, to the Stockholder
Representative for the benefit of the other Executing Stockholders, the
Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants.

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine and reasonably assume that a signatory
has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Executing
Stockholder or other party. A written decision, consent, notice
or instruction of the Stockholder Representative related to any of the
Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby shall
constitute a decision, consent, notice or instruction, as applicable, of all
of the Executing Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of the Executing Stockholders and such Executing Stockholders successors
as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Executing
Stockholder, and Parent may rely upon any such written decision, consent,
notice or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision,
consent, notice or instruction of each and every Executing Stockholder. Each
Executing Stockholder waives any and all defenses which may be available to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.
Parent and its Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such written
decision, consent, notice or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 



64 7.9 Insurance Matters.

 

(a) The Company shall and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the other Target Entities to maintain through the Closing adequate general
liability and casualty insurance coverage for the Company and its
Subsidiaries, their assets and their operations, in amounts that are
materially consistent with their existing insurance coverage. Subject to
_Section 7.12_, the risk of loss or damage to the assets of the Target
Entities by fire, other casualty or condemnation prior to the Closing is
retained by the Company.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent will cause
the Centerre Companies or their successors to maintain in effect the Centerre
Companies current directors and officers liability insurance covering those
persons who are currently covered by each of the Centerre Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy (copies of which have been made
available by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing on terms comparable to those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that the Company
shall purchase, prior to or concurrent with the Closing (if concurrent with
the Closing and not previously paid by the Company, as part of the Estimated
Closing Transaction Expenses), a prepaid directors and officers liability
insurance policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") that will remain in
effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date (the " _Run-Off
Insurance Policy_ "), the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are comparable to those of such policy currently in effect on the date
hereof for the Centerre Companies (but not the other Target Entities).

 

7.10 Cooperation on Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) The Executing Stockholders, the Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with each other, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the other Target Entities to cooperate, in connection with
all applications, documents and other steps needed in connection with making
(i) any filings and applications needed to obtain, or otherwise required to
be made in connection with, the Consents and Approvals of the Company, (ii)
any notifications required to be made to any licensing authorities prior to
the Closing, and (iii) other required filings, notifications and declarations
related to the transactions pursuant to this Agreement, as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, none of the covenants, representations and warranties made by the
Company or the Executing Stockholders in this Agreement, or any agreements
contemplated herein, shall in any manner be interpreted to speak to any
approvals, authorizations, clearances and filings which may be required for,
or in connection with, the operation of the Business subsequent to the
Closing.

(b) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to make, or cause to be made, all filings
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates (including the
Target Entities) with respect to the Closing. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide cooperation and assistance with
the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause the other Target Entities
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Lessor Estoppel with
respect to each Real Property Lease prior to the Closing. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall be responsible for obtaining any other consents and
waivers required in connection with the operation of the Business following
the Closing.

 



65 (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any communication it or any of
its Affiliates (including the Target Entities) receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, and
permit Parent to review in advance any proposed communication by or on behalf
of the recipient to any Governmental Authority. The Company shall not agree
to participate and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
other Target Entities to not participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with Parent in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives Parent the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. The Parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods including under
the HSR Act. Parent will pay the filing fees for all filings required by the
Parties under the HSR Act. The Parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents
and waivers set forth on _Schedule 8.2(q)_ prior to Closing. 

7.11 Post-Closing Distributions. If, at any time within one year following the
Closing Date, any Joint Venture makes a distribution to a Centerre Company of
Cash (other than a distribution of Cash to cover Tax Liabilities of such
Centerre Company) that was generated from the results of operations of the
applicable Joint Venture prior to the Closing Date and such Cash was not
reflected (whether as Cash or as part of Net Working Capital) on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, the Company shall pay to the Stockholder
Representative, for the benefit of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing
Option Holders and the Non-Owner Participants (in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares), an amount equal to such Cash that was not so reflected;
_provided_ , _however_ , to the extent that any Joint Venture maintained, as
of the Effective Time, an amount of Cash less than the minimum amount
customarily maintained by such Joint Ventures pursuant to its standard
operating practice (which amount is equal to the average of thirty (30) days
operating expenses for the trailing six (6) months), any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 7.11_ shall be first offset against the amount of
such Cash deficit to the extent such deficit was not actually recovered in
full pursuant to _Section 2.7_. During such one year period, Parent shall
not take any actions, and shall cause the Centerre Companies not to take any
actions, to cause any Joint Venture to make distributions of such Joint
Ventures excess Cash on a schedule other than that which is consistent with
past practice of such Joint Venture.

7.12 Material Hospital Destruction.

 

(a) If any material part or portion of any of the Hospitals is damaged,
condemned, lost or destroyed (whether by fire or other casualty event or by
condemnation or eminent domain) prior to the Effective Time (a " _Material
Hospital Destruction_ "), the Company shall notify Parent in writing (the "
_Casualty Notice_ ") as soon as possible of such Material
Hospital Destruction. The Casualty Notice shall set forth the Companys good
faith, reasonable estimate (the " _Destruction Estimate_ ") of the applicable
Target Entitys or Target Entities, as the case may be,
uninsured, unreimbursed or uncompensated (in the event of a condemnation)
cost to repair, replace or restore, as applicable, such Material Hospital
Destruction (the " _Aggregate Damage_ ").

 

(b) In the event that the Destruction Estimate is equal to or greater than Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) with respect to any one Hospital or Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate across all Hospitals (a " _Material
Loss_ "), Parent may, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the
Casualty Notice, terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Company,
and thereafter all Parties shall be released and relieved of all further
obligations, liabilities or claims hereunder.

 



66 (c) In the event that Parent objects to the Destruction Estimate, Parent shall
notify the Company of such objection in writing (the " _Parent Notice_ ")
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Casualty Notice. If the
Parties are unable to resolve their disagreement concerning the value of the
Aggregate Damage within ten (10) Business Days after the Companys receipt of
the Parent Notice, then the Independent Accounting Firm (selected in
accordance with _Section 2.7(a)_) shall determine, as promptly as possible,
the Aggregate Damage and confirm in writing that the value of the Aggregate
Damage either is less than a Material Loss or equals or exceeds a Material
Loss. If the Independent Accounting Firms report indicates that the value of
the Aggregate Damage is equal to or exceeds a Material Loss, Parent may
submit a written termination notice within five (5) Business Days after the
receipt of the Independent Accounting Firms report. In the event that Parent
does not elect to terminate this Agreement in respect of such Material Loss,
the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to such Material Loss
shall be governed by _Section 7.12(e)_ and _Section 7.12(f)_. In either
event, thereafter all Parties shall be released and relieved of all further
obligations, liabilities or claims hereunder. The Independent Accounting
Firms determination shall be final and binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error. The fees and costs of the Independent Accounting Firms
determination shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent.

(d) If a Material Hospital Destruction occurs prior to the Effective Time
that does not result in a Material Loss, the Parties shall consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and, subject to _Section 7.12(f)_ below,
the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product
of (A) the Aggregate Damage _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction equal to the
Centerre Companies ownership percentage in the Joint Venture that owns the
Hospital. 

(e) If a Material Hospital Destruction occurs prior to the Effective Time that
results in a Material Loss and Parent elects not to terminate this Agreement,
upon the consent of the Stockholder Representative and the Company, which
consent may be withheld in their sole discretion, the Parties shall consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, provided that, subject to _Section 7.12(f)_
below, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Aggregate Damage _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction equal to
the Centerre Companies ownership percentage in the Joint Venture that owns

or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the other Target
Entities to, and after the Closing the Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the other
Target Entities to, diligently seek by appropriate procedures any recovery to
which they may be entitled under any applicable insurance policies in respect
of the Aggregate Damage, and the Centerre Companies shall retain such
insurance proceeds on their books and records; provided that, after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or the other
Target Entities to, promptly pay an amount equal to such insurance proceeds
less the actual costs incurred in recovering such proceeds to the Stockholder
Representative (or its designee) for further distribution to the Executing
Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (less any applicable
withholding taxes, which the Company shall remit to the applicable
Governmental Authority).

(g) The Parties rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
any Material Hospital Destruction are governed exclusively by _Section 7.12_
(it being understood that such event shall not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect or cause a failure of any of the Closing Conditions to be satisfied).

 



67 7.13 WARN Act. Parent shall not carry out, after the Closing, any plant
closing or mass layoff that would require notification under or violate the
WARN Act at any facility of the Centerre Companies or any similar state or
local Law requiring notice to employees and their appropriate union
representatives of a plant closing, mass layoff or similar action, that does
or could reasonably be expected to result in any Losses that are incurred by
any of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders or Non-Owner
Participants.

(a) Between the execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company
and Parent shall cooperate with one another to evaluate each of the items set
forth on _Schedule 7.15(a)_ (the " _Identified Matters_ ") for compliance with
Healthcare Requirements. In the event that Parent determines in its sole
discretion that a self-disclosure with respect to any or all of the
Identified Matters to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (" _CMS_
"), the OIG or other applicable Governmental Authority is required or is a
prudent course of action, the Company shall cause the applicable Target
Entity to take such action prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company or such Target
Entity determines that any of the Identified Matters may be appropriately
resolved by a voluntary refund to the applicable Government Reimbursement
Program(s) and Parent agrees with such determination, which agreement may be
withheld in Parents sole and absolute discretion, the Company or such Target
Entity may, in lieu of a self-disclosure, file a voluntary refund with
respect to such violations or items with CMS, the OIG, the applicable Medicare
Administrative Contractor or other applicable Governmental Authority prior to
the Closing.

 

(b) Any such self-disclosures or voluntary refunds made pursuant to this
_Section 7.15_ shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent. The Company shall, or shall cause the applicable Target Entity to,
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on filings
prepared in connection with such self-disclosures or voluntary refunds
(including any information and materials reasonably requested by Parent
related to such self-disclosures or voluntary refunds) prior to submission to
the applicable Governmental Authority. After any such self-disclosure or
voluntary refund is filed, the Company shall, or shall cause the applicable
Target Entity to, amend any such filed self-disclosures or voluntary refunds
if the Company and Parent jointly determine in good faith that additional
self-disclosure or information is necessary to comply with applicable
Healthcare Requirements or the applicable self-disclosure protocol or
voluntary refund process. The Company shall, or shall cause such Target Entity
to, promptly furnish to Parent any written or electronic communication, or
a narrative description of any verbal communication to the applicable Target
Entity from the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such self-
disclosures and voluntary refunds, and permit Parent to review and comment on,
in advance, any proposed written response from the applicable Target Entity
to the applicable Governmental Authority.

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Parent and the Company
agree to reasonably cooperate with one another and provide the other and the
Stockholder Representative with continued access to all information,
documents, people, and other resources directly or indirectly related to the
Identified Matters and any self-disclosure or voluntary refund. Between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall work together
in good faith to complete the ongoing evaluation of the Identified Matters.

 

(d) The Company and Parent agree that they have certain common interests in
evaluating the Identified Matters, making any self-disclosure or voluntary
refund, and resolving any potential issues related thereto, as contemplated by
this _Section 7.15_. As such, the Company, Parent and their respective
counsel shall execute a joint defense agreement or common interest
agreement upon mutually acceptable terms in connection with carrying out the
obligations under this _Section 7.15_.

on _Schedule 7.16_ exercises its option or other similar rights to purchase
any CHC JV Subsidiarys ownership interest in the Joint Venture listed as item

consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and if the
Centerre Companies receive any proceeds from the JV Interest Sale prior to
Closing, then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of such
proceeds received by the Centerre Companies prior to Closing in respect of
such JV Interest Sale.

(c) In the event that, prior to the Closing, the JV Partner listed as item 2
on _Schedule 7.16_ exercises its option or other similar rights to purchase
any CHC JV Subsidiarys ownership interest in the Joint Venture listed as item
2 on  _Schedule 7.16_ (a " _JV Partner Buyout_ "), then the parties shall
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement, provided that the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the applicable amount set forth on
_Schedule 7.16_ attached hereto (the " _JV Buyout Reduction_ "), and to the
extent the consummation of such JV Partner Buyout does not occur prior to the
Closing, Parent shall pay, at Closing, an amount equal to the JV Buyout
Reduction to the Escrow Agent (the " _JV Buyout Escrow Amount_ "), such amount
to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement until the earlier of (i) the abandonment of the JV Partner Buyout
by the applicable JV Partner, (ii) the consummation of such JV Partner Buyout
or (iii) nine (9) months following the Closing Date. If the JV Buyout Escrow
Amount is to be released pursuant to (i) or (iii) above, Escrow Agent shall,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, pay the
JV Buyout Escrow Amount to the Stockholder Representative (or its designee)
for further distribution to the Executing Stockholders, Executing Option
Holders and the Non-Owner Participants (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares). If the JV Buyout Escrow Amount is to be released pursuant to (ii)
above, then the JV Buyout Escrow Amount shall be released as follows:

(i) If the proceeds of such JV Partner Buyout less the actual costs incurred
by Parent in consummating such JV Partner Buyout (the " _Net Buyout Amount_
") is less than or equal to the JV Buyout Escrow Amount, then the Escrow Agent
shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement,
pay (X) the Net Buyout Amount to the Stockholder Representative (or its
designee) for further distribution to the Executing Stockholders, Executing
Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares) and (Y) the remainder of the JV Buyout Escrow to Parent.

(ii) If the Net Buyout Amount is greater than the JV Buyout Escrow Amount,
then (X) the Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Escrow Agreement, pay JV Buyout Escrow Amount to the Stockholder
Representative (or its designee) and (Y) Parent shall pay the amount by which
the Net Buyout Amount exceeds the JV Buyout Escrow to the Stockholder
Representative (or its designee), in each case for further distribution to the

(in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares).

Companies and Parent shall cooperate with each other in determining the terms
and conditions of such JV Partner Buyout, including the purchase price, and
the applicable Centerre Company shall obtain the approval of Parent of such
buyout, including the purchase price, prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

7.17 Identified Cases. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has
engaged LW Consulting, Inc. (" _LW_ ") to review certain medical records of
the Hospitals as described on _Schedule 7.17_ , for the purpose of determining
their compliance with applicable medical records documentation requirements.
Within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
cause LW to provide the Company and Parent with a detailed accounting of its
findings, including the identification of any patient cases for which LW
concluded that the medical records documentation is reasonably unlikely to
prevail through the Medicare appeals process (" _Identified Cases_ "), and a
reasonably detailed explanation of LWs determination of why an
Identified Case failed to meet the applicable documentation requirements. If
the Company agrees with LWs determination with respect to any such Identified
Case, the Company will rebill or refund the underlying claim with the Medicare
program in accordance with applicable requirements and in a form acceptable
to Parent. In the event the Company disagrees with LWs determination of an
Identified Case or the dollar amount to be refunded with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide notice to Parent of such disagreement within five (5)
Business Days of LWs findings with respect to such Identified Case (the "
_Identified Case Dispute Notice_ "). The Company and Parent shall, and Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause LW to, work in good faith
to resolve such dispute during the five (5) Business Days following receipt of
the Identified Case Dispute Notice, and any resolution by them as to such
dispute shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. If the
Company, Parent and LW agree on the amount to be refunded by the Company with
respect to an Identified Case, then the Company shall voluntary refund such
agreed upon amount on or prior to Closing. If within five (5) Business Days
following Parents receipt of the Identified Case Dispute Notice, the Company,
Parent and LW are unable to reach an agreement with respect to such dispute,
then the Company and Parent shall submit such dispute to a mutually agreeable
third party expert in the subject matter of such dispute (the " _Identified
Cases Arbiter_ "). Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Identified Cases Arbiter to resolve all remaining
disagreements set forth in the Identified Case Dispute Notice as soon as
practicable, but in any event shall direct the Identified Cases Arbiter to
render a determination within ten (10) Business Days after its retention. The
determination by the Identified Cases Arbiter with respect to an Identified
Case submitted to it pursuant to this _Section 7.17_ shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties. If the Identified Cases Arbiter determines
that a refund is required to be made by the Company with respect to an
Identified Case, then the Company shall voluntarily refund such amount on or
prior to Closing. The fees and disbursements of the Identified Cases Arbiter
shall be borne (and paid) one half (1/2) by the Company and one half (1/2) by
Parent. This _Section 7.17_ shall exclusively govern the Parties rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Identified Cases. 

7.18 Withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and/or the Company
shall be entitled to withhold from any post-Closing payments to the
Stockholder Representative (or its designee) for further distribution to the
Executing Option Holders or Non-Owner Participants any Taxes owed by Parent
and/or the Company arising out of or relating to such payments.

performed or complied with by the Company prior to the Closing;

(iii) any unpaid Debt, unpaid Transaction Expenses, unpaid Change of Control
Payments, unpaid Cancellation Payments, unpaid amounts under the Bonus Plan or
unpaid Preferential Amounts, except to the extent any such amounts are unpaid
as a result of Parents (or following the Closing, the Companys) bad faith
or intentional misconduct or to the extent such amounts are properly payable
following the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and are so paid in accordance
with this Agreement;

 

(iv) subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, any unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent
not included in the calculation of the Merger Consideration as finally
determined in accordance with _Section 2.7_;

(v) any claims made by any Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or
Non-Owner Participant or other Person as a result of the alleged actions or
inaction of the Stockholder Representative arising from or in connection with

Representative arising from or in connection with the Stockholder
Representative Agreement;

(vi) the exercise by any Stockholder of the Company of such Stockholders
appraisal rights under the DGCL, including all Losses incurred by Parent or
the Company in connection with any Action or settlement in connection
therewith (it being understood that if a final determination of the fair
value of any Dissenting Shares is made by a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any such exercise of appraisal rights, then the only portion
of such fair value to be included in calculation of the Losses incurred as a
result of such exercise is the amount, if any, by which such fair value
exceeds what otherwise would have been payable by Parent with respect to such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement had they not been
Dissenting Shares);

(vii) the Documentation Matters; or

 

(viii) the Identified Matters.

 



76 (b) _Executing Stockholders_. Subject to _Section 9.3_ below, from and after
the Closing, each of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders
and Non-Owner Participants shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent
Indemnified Parties from and against any Loss incurred or suffered by such
Parent Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by such
Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant in
this Agreement, any Cancellation Letter or any Participant Agreement, as
applicable; or

(ii) a failure by such Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or Non-
Owner Participant to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement to be
performed or complied with by such Executing Stockholder, Executing Option
Holder and Non-Owner Participant in this Agreement, any Cancellation Letter
or any Participant Agreement, as applicable, including any covenant of payment
or to indemnify and hold harmless the Company.

 

Any amount paid pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall be paid to Parent or, at
Parents election, to the Company.

 

9.3 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 9.2_
above:

 

(a) with respect to any Loss arising out of or resulting from _Sections
9.2(a)(i)_ , _9.2(a)(vii)_ or _9.2(b)(i)_ , other than any Loss arising out
of or resulting from a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations and
Warranties, no indemnification shall be payable for such Losses unless the
total amount of all Losses incurred by Parent Indemnified Parties with
respect thereto exceeds One Million Nine Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($1,950,000) (the " _Basket_ "), whereupon indemnification shall be payable
for all indemnifiable Losses from the first dollar without regard to the
Basket;

 

(b) with respect to any Loss arising out of or resulting from _Sections
9.2(a)(i)_ , _9.2(a)(vii)_ or _9.2(b)(i)_ , other than any Loss arising out
of or resulting from a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations and
Warranties, the aggregate indemnification liability of the Executing
Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants shall
be limited to Losses incurred or suffered, in the aggregate, up to Fifteen
Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Cap_ ");

 

(c) with respect to any Loss arising out of or resulting from _Sections
9.2(a)(viii)_ , the aggregate indemnification liability of the Executing
Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants shall be
limited to Losses incurred or suffered, in the aggregate, up to the Identified
Matters Escrow Amount plus the then-remaining balance of the Indemnification
Cap; 

(d) with respect to any Loss arising out of or resulting from (i) _Sections
2.7(b)_ , _9.2(a)_ or _9.2(b)_ (other than  _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ ,
_9.2(a)(vii)_ , _9.2(a)(viii)_ and _9.2(b)(i)_ , which liability shall be
limited as provided in _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(c)_, as applicable)
or (ii) any breach or misrepresentation of any of the Fundamental
Representations and Warranties, the liability of each Executing Stockholder,
Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant shall be limited to Losses
incurred or suffered up to the net cash proceeds paid to such Executing
Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant pursuant to
_Article II_ of this Agreement;

(e) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights, remedies or claims of
Parent with respect to any fraud by any Executing Stockholder, Executing
Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant or, prior to the Closing, the Company
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;

 



77 (f) any amounts owed by the Executing Stockholders, Executing Option Holders
or Non-Owner Participants to a Parent Indemnified Party and arising out of or
resulting from _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_ of this Agreement shall be first offset
against the Documentation Escrow Amount to the extent available, and once the
Documentation Escrow Amount is completely depleted, the aggregate remaining
Losses payable to a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(vii)_ shall be limited to the then-remaining balance of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount;

 

(g) any amounts owed by the Executing Stockholders, Executing Option Holders
or Non-Owner Participants to a Parent Indemnified Party and arising out of or
resulting from _Section 9.2(a)(viii)_ of this Agreement shall be first offset
against the Identified Matters Escrow Amount to the extent available, and once
the Identified Matters Escrow Amount is completely depleted, the aggregate
remaining Losses payable to a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(viii)_ shall be limited to the then-remaining balance of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount;

 

(h) any amounts owed by the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option
Holders and Non-Owner Participants to a Parent Indemnified Party and arising
out of or resulting from _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_
or _Section 9.2(a)(viii)_, which are addressed in _Section 9.3(f)_ and
_Section 9.3(g)_ above, respectively) or  _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ of this
Agreement shall be first offset against the Indemnification Escrow Amount to
the extent available in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement prior to the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders
and Non-Owner Participants obligation to otherwise indemnify and hold
harmless any Parent Indemnified Party therefor; and

 

(i) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent any amounts
which a Parent Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification hereunder are reflected as current liabilities or Tax
Liabilities on the Final Closing Balance Sheet or as reductions in the
calculation of the Merger Consideration, then such amounts shall not be
considered Losses subject to indemnification hereunder.

9.4 Indemnification by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders, the Non-Owner
Participants and each of their respective Affiliates (including the Company
prior to Closing), stockholders, directors, officers, members, managers,
partners, employees, agents and representatives, and the successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ "),
from and against any Loss incurred or suffered by such Stockholder Indemnified
Party arising out of or resulting from:

 

(a) a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by or on
behalf of Parent in this Agreement;

 

(b) a failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent contained herein;

 

(c) a failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant in this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company following the
Closing; or

(d) any Post-Closing Taxes.

 

9.5 No Circular Recovery. No Executing Stockholder shall, and each Executing
Stockholder shall cause its Affiliate to not, make any claim for
indemnification against Parent or the Company (or any successor thereto)
pursuant to this _Article IX_ by reason of the fact that such Executing
Stockholder or Affiliate was a controlling person, director, employee or
representative of the Company or

 



78  was serving as such for another Person at the request of Parent or the
Company (whether such claim is for losses of any kind or otherwise and whether
such claim is pursuant to any statute, organizational document of any Person,
Contractual Obligation or otherwise) with respect to any indemnification claim
brought by a Parent Indemnified Party against any Executing Stockholder under
this _Article IX_.

 

9.6 Other Indemnification Matters.

 

(a) If Parent fully collects Losses from the Executing Stockholders, the
Executing Option Holders or Non-Owner Participants (or the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and/or Identified Matters Escrow Amount) in connection with
indemnification obligations of the Executing Stockholders, the Executing
Option Holders or Non-Owner Participants pursuant to this Agreement, and
Parent subsequently collects any funds from a third party that were the basis
for Parents claim for such indemnification, Parent shall remit the amount so
collected to the applicable Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or
Non-Owner Participant for reimbursement from which the Losses were received,
subject to satisfaction of any other valid indemnification claims by Parent
under this _Article IX_. If the Executing Stockholders fully collect Losses
from Parent in connection with the indemnification obligations of Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, and the Executing Stockholders subsequently
collect any funds from a third party that were the basis for the Executing
Stockholders claim for such indemnification, the Executing Stockholders
shall remit the amount so collected to Parent for reimbursement from which the
Losses were received.

(b) With respect to indemnification claims of a Parent Indemnified Party
arising under this _Article IX_ , if the Losses exceed the remaining
Indemnification Escrow Amount and Identified Matters Escrow Amount available
to provide indemnification for such claim, then Parent shall first set off
against any and all payments due to the applicable Executing Stockholder,
Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant at the time of such
indemnification claim, including, without limitation, an
Executing Stockholders Pro Rata Share of any Tax refunds and any amounts
payable to the Executing Stockholders pursuant to _Section 7.11_, any amount
to which any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder
by such Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner
Participant that is in excess of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount
and Identified Matters Escrow Amount available to provide indemnification for
such claim, prior to seeking payment of such Losses directly from such
Executing Stockholder, Executing Option Holder or Non-Owner Participant;
provided, however, that no Parent Indemnified Party shall have a duty to delay
its recovery with respect to an indemnification claim in expectation of a Tax
refund or other payment against which such set off could be made.

(c) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder as
required by applicable Law, provided that if such Indemnified Party does not
take such steps required by this _Section 9.6(c)_, such failure shall not
prevent such Indemnified Party from being indemnified hereunder, however, the
amount of Losses such Indemnified Party is indemnified for shall be limited to
the amount of Losses such Indemnified Party would have incurred if it had not
breached its obligation under this _Section 9.6(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary Parent shall be
entitled to rely on all representations and warranties of the Company and the
Executing Stockholders, and any evaluation or investigation by Parent shall
not affect the representations and warranties made by the
Executing Stockholders and/or the Company in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the remedies of Parent for breaches of those
representations and warranties.

 



79 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, prior to the
Adjustment Payment Date, Parent shall be entitled to recover any amounts owed
by the Executing Stockholders, the Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner
Participants to a Parent Indemnified Party and arising out of or resulting
from _Sections 9.2(a)(iii)_ ,  _9.2(a)(iv)_ and _9.2(a)(vi)_ from the
Adjustment Escrow Amount to the extent available in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Escrow Agreement prior to recovering such amount from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Escrow Agreement or directly from the Executing Stockholders, the
Executing Option Holders and Non-Owner Participants in accordance with this
_Article IX_.

 

9.7 Assumption of Defense. An Indemnified Party (or in the case of a
Stockholder Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) shall promptly
give notice to each Indemnifying Party after obtaining knowledge of any matter
as to which recovery may be sought against such Indemnifying Party because of
the indemnity set forth above, and, if such indemnity shall arise from
the claim of a third party, shall provide such notice no later than forty-
five (45) days after the Indemnifying Party first receives notice of such
claim and shall permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any
such claim or any proceeding resulting from such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give any such notice promptly shall not affect the
indemnification provided under this _Article IX_ , except, and only, to the
extent such Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of any such third-party claim if
(i) the claim could reasonably result in imprisonment of or imposition of a
civil or criminal fine against the Indemnified Party or its representatives,
(ii) the claim could reasonably result in an equitable remedy that would
impair the Indemnified Partys ability to exercise its rights under this
Agreement, or impair Parents right or ability to operate or control any
Target Entity or any Target Entity Operation, (iii) the claim names both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (including impleaded parties)
and representation of both such Parties by the same counsel would create a
conflict, (iv) the aggregate amount of all Losses with respect to such claim
or demand exceeds the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount and
Identified Matters Escrow Amount available to provide indemnification for
such claim or demand, or (v) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel
that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party is
reasonably likely to be prejudiced by such conflict of interest. If an
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such third party claim, such
Indemnifying Party shall agree prior thereto, in writing, that it is liable
under this _Article IX_ to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with
the terms contained herein in respect of such claim (subject to the
limitations and other terms and conditions set forth in _Article IX_ ), shall
conduct such defense diligently, shall have full and complete control over the
conduct of such proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party and shall,
subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.7_, have the right to decide
all matters of procedure, strategy, substance and settlement relating to such
proceeding; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
without the written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of the Indemnified Party (or in the case of a
Stockholder Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the matter
which (x) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or the claimant
in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect
thereto and (y) in the case of Parent, does not include any provision that
would impose any obligation (including an obligation to refrain from taking
action) upon the Centerre Companies. The Indemnified Party may participate in
such proceeding and retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense.
Failure by an Indemnifying Party to notify the Indemnified Party (or in the
case of a Stockholder Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) of
its election to defend any such claim or proceeding by a third party within
thirty (30) days after notice thereof shall have been given to
such Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party (or in the case of a
Stockholder Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative), shall be
deemed a waiver by such Indemnifying Party of its right to defend such claim
or action; provided that, if a shorter time is necessary to timely respond to
a court filing, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to employ legal
counsel to respond to such filing until receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a
timely notice of its election to defend such claim or proceeding.

 



80 9.8 Non-Assumption of Defense. If no Indemnifying Party is permitted or elects
to assume the defense of any such claim by a third party or proceeding
resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party shall defend against such claim or
litigation in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate and, in such
event, the Indemnifying Party or Parties shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, legal
or otherwise, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
against such claim or proceeding, as such costs and expenses are incurred,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_.

9.9 Indemnified Partys Cooperation as to Proceedings. The Indemnified Party
will cooperate in all reasonable respects with any Indemnifying Party in the
conduct of any proceeding as to which such Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense. The Indemnifying Party or Parties shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, legal
or otherwise, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith, as
such costs and expenses are incurred, subject to the limitations set forth
in  _Section 9.3_.

9.10 Right to Retain Separate Counsel. If, in accordance with any of the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any third party
claim, the Indemnifying Party may participate in such proceeding and retain
separate counsel at its sole cost and expense.

 

9.11 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Amounts paid to or on behalf of
Parent or Executing Stockholders as indemnification hereunder shall be
treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

9.12 Exclusive Remedy. The Parties acknowledge that, after the Closing, their
(and their respective Affiliates) sole and exclusive remedy with respect to a
breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_  (other than claims
and causes of action based on fraud and except for the remedies of specific
performance, injunction and other equitable relief).

 

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent;

(b) by Parent, if the Company or the Executing Stockholders have breached this
Agreement in any material respect and the Company or the Executing
Stockholders, as applicable, have failed to cure such breach no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and, in any event, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from Parent identifying the nature of
the breach with reasonable detail and requesting that such breach be cured;

(c) by the Company or the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Executing Stockholders) if Parent has breached this Agreement in any material
respect and Parent has failed to cure such breach no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and, in any event, within thirty (30)
days of receipt of notice from the Company and/or the Stockholder
Representative identifying the nature of the breach with reasonable detail and
requesting that such breach be cured;

 



81 (d) by Parent, the Company or the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Executing Stockholders) in the event that (i) any Law shall have been enacted
or promulgated by any Governmental Authority that directly prohibits the
consummation of the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)
any final, non-appealable Order shall have been issued that expressly
precludes the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(e) by Parent, the Stockholder Representative or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.12_;

(f) by Parent, the Company or the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Executing Stockholders) in the event that the Closing shall not have
occurred at or before 12:01 a.m. Central time on March 1, 2015 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , no Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_, if the failure to consummate
the transactions described herein on or before the Termination Date results
from the failure by such Party or Parties seeking such termination to act in
good faith to fulfill any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ that is a
condition precedent to the obligation of the other Parties under this
Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_); or

(g) by Parent pursuant to _Section 11.2_. 

10.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing and the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force and effect and each of the Parties
shall be relieved of its, his or her (as applicable) respective obligations
hereunder to the extent that such obligations would otherwise arise after the
date of such termination, except for the provisions of _Section 7.5_
(relating to confidentiality and announcement), _Section 10.2_ (relating to
effect of termination) and _Article XI_ (relating to certain miscellaneous
provisions). 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_, _10.1(d)_
, _10.1(e)_ , _10.1(f)_ , or  _10.1(g)_ , none of the Parties shall be liable
to the other Parties hereunder for any liabilities and damages incurred as a
result of such termination.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Expenses. Each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses related to the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the unpaid
Transaction Expenses shall be paid in accordance with _Section 2.6_ of
this Agreement and all filing fees required under the HSR Act shall be paid
by Parent.

11.2 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules shall be attached to this
Agreement as of the date hereof and arranged in schedules corresponding to the
sections contained in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ of this Agreement, and any
disclosure made in any schedule of the Disclosure Schedules shall qualify
other schedules of the Disclosure Schedules if such schedule specifically
refers to such other schedule in the Disclosure Schedules or to the extent
that the disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure
is applicable to such other schedule. During the period commencing on the date
of this Agreement and ending on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall promptly provide written updates to Parent
upon becoming aware of any facts or circumstances that arise

 



82  after the date hereof that would cause any of the Executing Stockholders or
the Companys representations or warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ to
not be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date (a "
_Disclosure Supplement_ "). Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of a
Disclosure Supplement related to a fact or circumstance which has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Target Entities and the Target Entity Operations taken as a
whole, Parent may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the
Company and the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at the election of Parent, each Disclosure
Supplement may be deemed accepted for purposes of satisfying the closing
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_, provided, however, no Disclosure
Supplement or any disclosure of any matters set forth therein shall affect the
indemnification rights of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect
to any representations and warranties made by the Executing Stockholders
and/or the Company in this Agreement and such representations and warranties
shall be deemed to have been made without the effect of any Disclosure
Supplement, other than a Disclosure Supplement that is solely for listing
purposes and does not contain any fact, condition or circumstance that could
result in any Losses or other adverse effect upon the Company or the Parent
Indemnified Parties.

 

11.3 Entirety of Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules
and all other schedules and exhibits hereto), together with the other
Transaction Documents and certificates and other instruments delivered
hereunder and thereunder, state the entire agreement of the Parties, merge all
prior negotiations, agreements and understandings, if any, and state in full
all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that have induced
this Agreement. Each Party agrees that in dealing with third parties no
contrary representations will be made.

 

11.4 Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or

transmission of any signed original counterpart transmission shall be deemed
the same as the delivery of an original.

11.7 Assignment; Binding Nature; No Beneficiaries. This Agreement may not be
assigned by any Party hereto without the written consent of the other Parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign its rights hereunder

inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their

of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_, _Section 7.4(b)_, _Section
7.12(c)_ or _Section 7.17_ of this Agreement, in the event of a dispute
hereunder or any other transaction contemplated hereby, including under or
with respect to any of the Transaction Documents (any such dispute,
controversy or claim, a " _Dispute_ "), arbitration will be the sole and
exclusive method of resolving the dispute, except that a Party may seek a
preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other preliminary
judicial relief in the event of or to prevent a breach of the Non-
Solicitation and Non-Disclosure Agreement or any covenants set forth in any of

unconditionally submits, for itself or himself and its or his property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state court in Davidson County, Tennessee or
federal court of the United States of America sitting in Davidson County,
Tennessee and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Action arising out
of or relating thereto.

 

(b) The arbitrator will consist of any person who is mutually acceptable to
the Parties to the dispute. However, if the Parties are unable to agree on a
single arbitrator, an arbitration panel of three arbitrators will be selected
as provided below. Each Party (Parent, on the one hand, and the Executing
Stockholders (acting through the Stockholder Representative) on the other
hand), shall select one arbitrator, within ten (10) days from the date one
Party advises the other Party in writing that it cannot agree on a single
arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the two chosen by
the Parties within ten (10) days of such two arbitrators being chosen. Every
arbitrator must be independent (not a Party to this Agreement or a lawyer or
relative to a Party to this Agreement or an agent, officer, director,
employee, shareholder or Affiliate of a Party to or a relative of any of
those persons) without any

 



85  economic or financial interest of any kind in the outcome of the
arbitration. Each arbitrators conduct will be governed by the rules of the
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (" _JAMS_ "). The
arbitration will be conducted in Davidson County, Tennessee, in accordance
with the rules of JAMS and the discovery rules of the Tennessee Rules of Civil
Procedure. The arbitrator or arbitration panel will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the arbitration to be concluded as soon as practicable. The
arbitrators shall not be empowered to award punitive, exemplary or other penal
damages or make any awards which are inconsistent or in excess of the
terms and limitations set forth in _Article IX_.

(c) The arbitrator or a majority of the arbitration panel shall render its
decision in writing within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the
hearing. The decision of the arbitrator arbitration panel will be final,
binding and conclusive as to all the Parties and the decision of the
arbitrator or arbitration panel will not be subject to appeal, review or re-
examination, except for willful misconduct by an arbitrator that prejudices
the rights of any Party to the arbitration. Any Party may enforce the
arbitration award in any state or federal court located in the U.S. 

11.11 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement.

11.12 Further Assurances. Each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with all requirements imposed by this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents on such Party and to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to be consummated
as contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and shall,
from time to time and without further consideration, either before or after
the Closing, execute such further instruments and take such other actions as
any other Party shall reasonably request in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement and to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents.

 

11.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASSIGNEE,
SUCCESSOR, HEIR OR PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF A PARTY SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL
IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER AGREEMENTS OR
THE DEALINGS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL SEEK
TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION, IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED, WITH
ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES HERETO,
AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS. NO PARTY HERETO HAS
IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO THAT THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 

11.14 Legal Representation. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP (" _Bradley Arant_ ")
may serve as counsel to each and any Stockholder Group Member, in connection
with any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation or any continued representation of any other Person, and
each of the Parties (on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates) hereto
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. The
decision to represent any Stockholder Group Member shall be solely that of
Bradley Arant. Any privilege attaching as a result of Bradley Arant
representing the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Transaction_ ") shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in effect, provided that such privilege to the extent solely related to
the Transaction from and after the Effective Time shall be assigned to and
controlled by the Stockholder Representative. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees to take, and to cause its
Affiliates to take, the steps reasonably necessary to ensure

 



86  that any privilege attaching as a result of Bradley Arant representing the
Company in connection with the Transaction shall survive the Closing and, to
the extent solely related to the Transaction, remain in effect and be
assigned to and controlled by the Stockholder Representative. As to any
privileged attorney client communications between Bradley Arant and the
Company prior to the Closing Date to the extent solely related to the
Transaction (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), each of
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each Parent
Indemnified Party not to, use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications
in any Action against or involving any of the Parties hereto or any of their
respective Affiliates after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall prevent a Parent Indemnified Party from requesting,
using or accessing any Privileged Communications in connection with document
production requests or discovery in any Action so long as such Privileged
Communications would not be subject to an attorney-client privilege if they
were being requested in an Action by an unrelated third party and such
Privileged Communications are produced or required to be produced in response
to such document production requests or discovery. Following the Closing, the
Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to use the Privileged
Communications in connection with the defense of any claim by a Parent
Indemnified Party, provided that such use does not waive any applicable
privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure
of any Privileged Communications to any third party. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub further agrees that, on its own behalf and on behalf each other Parent
Indemnified party, Bradley Arants retention by the Company shall be
deemed completed and terminated without any further action by any Person
effective as of the Closing; provided, however, that Bradley Arant shall keep
all nonpublic information relating to the Company confidential in accordance
with applicable rules of professional conduct and, if requested by the
Company, deliver to the Company or destroy all documents (in any format,
including hardcopy and electronic) relating to the Company that do not relate
to the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
11.14_ or in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable
privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of
any Privileged Communications to any third party, and neither the Stockholder
Representative nor any Executing Stockholder shall take any action, or cause
Bradley Arant to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to waive
any such privilege or protection as to any third party.
