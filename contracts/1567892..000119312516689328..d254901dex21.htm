23  Closing Costs and (vii) the IT Carve-Out Pre-Closing Costs (altogether the "

Buyers shall, and shall cause their officers, directors, employees and
accountants to afford Mallinckrodt UK and its authorized representatives
reasonable access to the offices, books and records necessary for a review by

items set forth in the Final Closing Statement, including,

Construction Pre-Closing Costs or the IT Carve-Out Pre-Closing Costs (the "
_Notice of Dispute_ "), it being understood that all items and amounts in the
Final Closing Statement not specifically referenced as being in dispute in
the Notice of Dispute shall be deemed to have been agreed upon, and shall be
final, for all purposes hereof. If no Notice of Dispute is delivered by
Mallinckrodt UK to the Buyers within such forty-five (45) day period, it
shall be conclusively presumed that the Final Closing Statement and thus the
Final Purchase Price, the RandD Lab Construction Pre-Closing Costs and the IT
Carve-Out Pre-Closing Costs and all other amounts and items set forth therein
as prepared by the Buyers have been agreed upon for all purposes of this
Section 2.4. Upon the Buyers receipt of any Notice of Dispute, Mallinckrodt
UK and the Buyers shall promptly consult with each other with respect to the
specified points of disagreement set forth in the Notice of Dispute in an
effort to resolve the dispute. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by
Mallinckrodt UK and the Buyers within thirty (30) days after the

jointly refer the dispute to an international accounting firm that is an
expert in all relevant accounting matters and standards and that has no
material relationship with any of the Parties appointed by mutual agreement
of the Parties (the " _Expert_ "), to finally resolve, as soon as practicable,
and in any event within sixty (60) days after such reference, all unresolved
points of disagreement with respect to the Final Closing Statement. For
purposes of such determination by the Expert, each of Mallinckrodt UK and the
Buyers shall submit to the Expert a proposed calculation of each disputed
issue and a written statement of its position with respect to each disputed
issue. The Expert shall apply the applicable terms of this Agreement and in
particular the defined terms set forth herein to resolve the issues for
dispute and shall otherwise make its determination in accordance with
such procedures as the Parties may agree. In no event shall the Expert assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Party. The Experts determination shall be based solely on written
submissions by Mallinckrodt UK and the Buyers

 



24  (i.e., not an independent review) and on the definitions included herein,
and shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder and
shall not be subject to appeal or further review. Each of the Parties shall
bear its own expenses in connection with any such dispute, except that the
fees and expenses of the Expert shall be allocated reasonably by the Expert.
All determinations by the Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding with
respect to the Final Closing Statement and any item or amount set forth
therein, in the absence of fraud or manifest error.

this Agreement to the contrary, if the amounts set forth in the Final Closing
Statement (as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.4(b)) with

the Final Closing Statement.

(g) Any payment required to be made under this Section 2.4 by either
Mallinckrodt UK or the Buyers shall be by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, not more than ten (10) days after final determination
thereof, to an account to be designated by the payee at least five (5) days
prior to the due date.

2.5 _Taxes_.

 

(a) All sales, use, value-added, gross receipts, registration, stamp or other
similar transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transfer and purchase
of the Netherlands Shares and the US Interests, as contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement, including all recording or filing fees, notarial fees and
other similar costs of Closing, that may be imposed upon, or payable,
collectible or incurred (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne
by the Buyers. The Buyers and the Sellers agree to (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts in good faith to minimize the applicability and amount of
any Transfer Taxes that may be assessed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder and (ii) cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of
applicable Law in connection with the payment of any such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Any Indemnified Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes, shall be borne by
Mallinckrodt UK. Any Excluded Taxes shall be borne by the Buyers.

(c) The Parties shall apportion any liability for Taxes with respect to the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period
in the manner set forth in this Section 2.5(c). In the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of such Tax which relates to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes described in clause (ii), be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Taxes based
upon or related to income or receipts or imposed in connection with payments
to other persons (including wages) or any sale or other transfer or assignment
of

 



26  property (whether real or personal or tangible or intangible), be deemed to
be equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date pursuant to an interim closing of the books. Any
credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though
the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of business on the Closing
Date.

 

(d) The Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including reasonable access to books and records), making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and other assistance and to
otherwise cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Person, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, the
conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or Proceeding relating to any Tax matter with respect to the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries. Any Tax audit or other Tax
Proceeding with respect to a Pre-Closing Period (including any Straddle
Period) shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 2.5(e) below.
The provisions above apply equally to any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary that is treated as a disregarded entity under applicable Law.

 

(e) _Tax Claims_.

(i) After the Closing, the Buyers shall within ten (10) Business Days notify
Mallinckrodt UK in writing upon receipt by the Buyers or any Affiliate of the
Buyers (including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries)
of any written notice of any pending or threatened audit, examination or
assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative or
judicial proceeding or similar claim relating to Taxes of any Pre-Closing
Period (including any Straddle Period) with respect to which Mallinckrodt UK
could be liable hereunder (a " _Tax Claim_ " and collectively the " _Tax
Claims_ ") _provided_ , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to the extent the
indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(ii) Mallinckrodt UK shall have the option (but not the obligation) to
control representation with respect to any Tax Claim to the extent it relates
to one or more tax periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date, provided
that Mallinckrodt UK (or any of their Affiliates) notifies Buyers of its
decision to exercise such option within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt
of Buyers notification of such Tax Claim pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)(i)_.
With respect to any such Tax Claim controlled by Mallinckrodt UK pursuant to
the prior sentence, at Mallinckrodt UKs own expense, Mallinckrodt UK shall
take any and all actions with respect to the defense of all such Tax Claims
(and the Buyers shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Indirect Subsidiaries to, provide Mallinckrodt UK with the appropriate powers
of attorney or other necessary authorizations); _provided, however_ , the
Buyers shall be entitled, at their election and at their own expense, to
participate in any such Tax Claims, review in advance any correspondence
prepared in connection with such Tax Claims, comment on any such Tax Claims,
and employ counsel at their own expense; _provided, further_ , that
Mallinckrodt UK, irrespective of whether or not the Buyers have elected to so
participate in the defense of any Tax Claim, may not settle or compromise any
Tax Claim if such settlement would

 



27  result in Buyers being liable for any amounts under this Agreement or
otherwise without the Buyers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Mallinckrodt UK shall, at its sole expense,
keep the Buyers timely informed with respect to the status and nature of any
Tax Claims.

 

(iii) The Buyers will control representation with respect to any Tax Claim
that Mallinckrodt UK does not elect to control pursuant to Section
2.5(e)(ii), _provided, however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Claims,
Mallinckrodt UK shall be entitled, at its election and at its own expense, to
participate in any such Tax Claims, review in advance any
correspondence prepared in connection with such Tax Claims, comment on any
such Tax Claims, and employ counsel at their own expense; _provided, further_
, that the Buyers, irrespective of whether or not Mallinckrodt UK has elected
to so participate in the defense of any Tax Claim, may not settle or
compromise any such Tax Claim that it controls pursuant to this _Section
2.5(e)(iii)_ without Mallinckrodt UKs consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Buyers shall keep
Mallinckrodt UK timely informed with respect to the status and nature of any
such Tax Claims.

(iv) To the extent there is a conflict between the provisions of this Section
2.5(e), on the one hand, and the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4, on the
other hand, with respect to any Tax Claim, the provisions of this Section
2.5(e) shall govern.

(f) Tax Returns and Certain Related Matters.

 

(i) Mallinckrodt UK shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause
to be filed, all Income Tax Returns for the entities listed in  _Schedule
2.5(f)(i)_ relating to Pre-Closing Periods (other than Straddle Periods) that
are required to be filed after the Closing. Mallinckrodt UK shall provide the
Buyers with a draft of each such Income Tax Return at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Income Tax Return. All such Income Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Past Practice of the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries in preparing
their applicable Tax Returns (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).
The Buyers shall have fifteen (15) days to review, comment on, approve the
content of and consent to the filing of such Income Tax Returns prior to the
filing thereof. Mallinckrodt UK shall make such revisions as are reasonably
requested by the Buyers, and the Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK agree to consult
and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such
Income Tax Returns by the Buyers prior to the filing of such Income Tax
Returns. In the event Mallinckrodt UK and the Buyers are unable to agree upon
resolution of such issues, Mallinckrodt UK shall make the final determination
as to the resolution of any disputed items. Mallinckrodt UK shall promptly,
but in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date
for the payment thereof, remit to the Buyers any Taxes shown on any such Tax
Returns for which Mallinckrodt UK is liable pursuant to  _Sections 2.5(b)_
and _2.5(c)_ and the Buyers shall cause such amounts to be timely paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority. Mallinckrodt UK shall bear the costs of
preparing any Tax Return prepared pursuant to this  _Section 2.5(f)(i)_.

 



28 (ii) Except for Tax Returns prepared pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)(i)_, the
Buyers shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed,
all Tax Returns for the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries
that are required to be filed after the Closing. Buyers shall provide
Mallinckrodt UK with a draft of each such Income Tax Return that reflects an
amount of Taxes for which Mallinckrodt UK is liable under this Agreement at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Income Tax
Return. All such Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with Past Practice of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect
Subsidiaries in preparing their applicable Tax Returns (unless otherwise
required by applicable Law). Mallinckrodt UK shall have fifteen (15) days
to review, comment on, approve the content of and consent to the filing of
such Income Tax Returns prior to the filing thereof. The Buyers shall make
such revisions as are reasonably requested by Mallinckrodt UK, and the Buyers
and Mallinckrodt UK agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issues
arising as a result of the review of such Income Tax Returns by Mallinckrodt
UK prior to the filing of such Income Tax Returns. In the event Mallinckrodt
UK and the Buyers are unable to agree upon resolution of such issues, the
disputed items will be resolved (within a reasonable time) by an independent
accounting firm chosen by both the Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK. Upon resolution
of all such items, the relevant Tax Return will be filed, or if necessary,
amended on that basis. The costs, fees and expenses of the independent
accounting firm will be allocated between the Buyers, on the one hand, and
Mallinckrodt UK, on the other hand, in the same manner as provided in 
_Section 2.4(b)_. Mallinckrodt UK shall promptly remit to the Buyers any
Taxes shown on such Tax Returns for which Mallinckrodt UK is liable pursuant
to _Sections 2.5(b)_ and _2.5(c)_ and the Buyers shall cause such amounts to
be timely paid to the applicable Governmental Authority. The Buyers shall
bear the costs of preparing any Tax Return prepared pursuant to this _Section
2.5(f)(ii)_.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the avoidance of
doubt, the failure of a party to deliver a draft Tax Return prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return will not void any indemnity obligation
hereunder and failure or inability of the other party to exercise its review
or comment or consent right shall not prevent the party with the filing
obligation from timely filing a Tax Return, which Tax Returns can be amended,
as necessary, following exercise of review, comment or consent rights.

(iv) All Tax Returns for taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any Straddle Period) with
respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries shall be
the responsibility of the Buyers.

(v) Unless required by applicable Law, the Buyers shall not cause or permit
any Transferred Subsidiary, Indirect Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyers to
amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period (including a Straddle Period)
that could reasonably result in any increased Tax liability for which
Mallinckrodt UK would be liable or could reasonably cause any reduction or
impairment of any refund or other Tax benefit that would be enjoyed by
Mallinckrodt UK, including under this Agreement, for any Pre-Closing Period or
a portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Mallinckrodt UK, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



29 (vi) The Buyers shall, and shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary and
Indirect Subsidiary to, make any available elections to waive the right to
carry back any Tax Attribute generated in a taxable period or portion thereof
ending after the Threshold Date to a taxable period or portion thereof ending
on or prior to the Threshold Date, unless Mallinckrodt UK gives the Buyers
prior written consent to not make such elections, such consent to be exercised
in Mallinckrodt UKs sole discretion.

 

(vii) Until after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, except (A) to the
extent required by applicable Law, (B) if the failure to so change would have
a material adverse effect on the Buyers and their subsidiaries or (C) if there
is a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.6(m),
without the prior written consent of Mallinckrodt UK, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Buyers shall not be
permitted and shall not permit any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary to take the actions described in _Schedule 2.5(f)(vii)_.

 

(g) Except to the extent reflected in the calculation of Final Purchase Price,
the Buyers shall promptly pay or shall cause prompt payment to be made to
Mallinckrodt UK of all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by, or
credited against Tax liability of the Buyers in lieu of a Tax refund, any
Affiliate of the Buyers, or any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Period (including the portion of a
Straddle Period ending as of the end of business on the Closing Date),
_provided_ , that (A) payments to Mallinckrodt UK under this Section 2.5(g)
shall be net of (1) any out-of-pocket costs associated in obtaining such
refund of Taxes, (2) any Tax required to be withheld on such payment and (3)
any Taxes actually imposed on the Buyers or any of their Affiliates (including
the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries) as a result of
such refunds and (B) no Tax refund (or credit for overpayment) shall be due to
the extent it arises as a result of a carryforward of a loss or credit (other
than a credit for overpayment) or other Tax benefit arising in a Pre-Closing
Period to a Post-Closing Period. If there is a subsequent reduction by a
taxing authority (or by virtue of a change in applicable Tax Law), of any
amounts with respect to which a payment has been made to Mallinckrodt UK by
the Buyers pursuant to this Section 2.5(g), then Mallinckrodt UK shall pay the
Buyers an amount equal to such reduction plus any interest or penalties
imposed by a taxing authority with respect to such reduction. 

(h) All Tax sharing or similar agreements to which any Transferred Subsidiary
or Indirect Subsidiary is a party (other than (1) the Tax Matters Agreement
between Covidien plc and Mallinckrodt plc dated June 28, 2013, (2) Excluded
Tax Sharing Agreements, and (3) those Tax sharing or similar agreements to
which any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary is a party with
another Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary which the Buyers request
in writing to Mallinckrodt UK not be terminated prior to the close of business
on the Closing Date) and all powers of attorney with respect to Taxes
relating to the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries shall
be terminated as of the Effective Time and, after such time, no Transferred
Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have any rights or
obligations thereunder. 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining the amount of any
Taxes owed hereunder by Mallinckrodt UK (or an Affiliate of Mallinckrodt UK),
there shall be taken into account as a reduction in such obligation (without
duplication of any amounts paid to Mallinckrodt UK pursuant to Section 2.5(g))
any deposit, prepayment, estimated payment, carryforward or similar amount
(i) paid or credited at any time by Mallinckrodt UK or an Affiliate of
Mallinckrodt UK, and (ii) paid or credited on or before the Closing Date by
the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Indirect Subsidiaries, or an Affiliate of
any of them, in either case, except to the extent reflected in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

 



30 (j) Until the later of (i) the expiration of any applicable statutes of
limitations and (ii) seven (7) years after the Threshold Date, the parties
shall retain records, documents, accounting data and other information
(including computer data) necessary for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns (" _Tax Records_ ") in respect of Taxes of any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries. At any time after the Closing Date and
before seven (7) years after the Threshold Date that either party propose to
destroy any such Tax Records (the " _First Party_ "), it shall first notify
the other party (the " _Requesting Party_ ") in writing and the Requesting
Party shall be entitled to receive such materials or information proposed to
be destroyed at the Requesting Partys expense if the Requesting Party so
notifies the First Party in writing, provided that the Requesting Party
notifies the First Party in writing within thirty (30) days from the day the
Requesting Party receives the requisite notification from the First Party.

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyers or
their designee and the Transferred Subsidiaries, Indirect Subsidiaries, or
any party to this Agreement shall be entitled to withhold and deduct from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
Buyers or their designee or such other person are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment as required by the Code or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

 

(l) Prior to the Closing Date, Mallinckrodt UK shall request a withholding
certificate from the IRS pursuant to Treasury regulation Section 1.1445-3
stating that no withholding is required pursuant to Code Section 1445 in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Withholding Certificate_ "). If the Withholding Certificate is received
prior to Closing, Mallinckrodt UK shall provide a copy of such Withholding
Certificate to Buyers at or prior to the Closing. If the Withholding
Certificate is not received prior to Closing, Mallinckrodt UK shall provide
notice of its application for the Withholding Certificate to Buyers at or
prior to Closing, and Buyers shall withhold an amount equal to fifteen percent
(15%) of the amount of the amount realized for U.S. federal income tax
purposes with respect to any U.S. real property interests held by
Mallinckrodt US (the " _Holdback Funds_ "). When the Withholding Certificate
is received, Mallinckrodt UK shall provide a copy of such Withholding
Certificate to Buyers and Buyers shall promptly remit the Holdback Funds to
Mallinckrodt US. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyers shall be permitted
to remit any amount of the Holdback Funds to the IRS pursuant to Section 1445
of the Code if the Withholding Certificate received states that
such remittance is required, the request for a Withholding Certificate is
denied, or such remittance is otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

2.6 _Allocation of Final Purchase Price_. The Final Purchase Price and any
adjustments thereto shall be allocated for income tax purposes between the
Netherlands Shares and the US Interests in accordance with _Schedule 2.6_. Any
additional consideration paid by the Buyers pursuant to Section 2.9 shall be
allocated for income tax purposes to the US Interests,

 



31  other than any additional consideration paid pursuant to Section 2.9(c),
which shall be allocated to the Netherlands Shares. Within sixty (60) days
after final determination (by agreement or otherwise) of the Final Purchase
Price, the RandD Lab Construction Pre-Closing Costs and the IT Carve-Out Pre-
Closing Costs, Mallinckrodt UK shall prepare and deliver to the US Buyer, for
its review, a schedule allocating the portion of the Final Purchase Price,
the RandD Lab Construction Pre-Closing Costs, and the IT Carve-Out Pre-Closing
Costs, in each case, that is attributable to the US Interests, plus the
assumed liabilities of Mallinckrodt US (to the extent included in " _amount
realized_ " for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of
Mallinckrodt US and the appropriate covenants set forth in Section 6.7 in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, as appropriate (the " _Allocation_ "). The US Buyer
shall have the right, for thirty (30) days after such delivery, to provide
reasonable, written comments to such draft Allocation. If the US
Buyer provides written comments to the draft Allocation within such thirty
(30) day period, the US Buyer and Mallinckrodt UK shall negotiate in good
faith for thirty (30) days after such comments are delivered in an attempt to
resolve any disagreements between them with respect to such draft Allocation.
If the US Buyer does not object to such draft Allocation within such thirty
(30) day period, or the US Buyer and Mallinckrodt UK resolve any disagreements
between them with respect to such draft Allocation, (i) such Allocation shall
be final and binding on the Parties, (ii) none of the Parties or any Affiliate
thereof shall take any position (whether in audits, in other Proceedings, on
any Tax Return or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the final Allocation,
unless required by applicable Law, (iii) any subsequent adjustments to the
Final Purchase Price shall be reflected in amendments to the Allocation made
in accordance with the principles set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1060-1 and (iv) any additional consideration paid by the Buyers pursuant to
Section 2.9 shall be allocated to Section 197 intangibles, as defined in the
Code, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the related Treasury
Regulations. If the US Buyer and Mallinckrodt UK are unable to resolve all
such disagreements with respect to the draft Allocation, then the Allocation
shall not be binding on the Parties.

 

2.7 _Completion of Transfers and Assurance of Beneficial Interest_.

 

(a) In the event that, notwithstanding the sale of the Shares hereunder at
Closing, legal title, or other rights of ownership, use or possession, to any
of the Business Assets is not owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held by the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries at Closing, Mallinckrodt
UK shall, or shall cause an Affiliate thereof holding such Business Assets
to, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, hold such Business Assets as
nominee for the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries until
completion of such transfers in accordance with the provisions of Sections
2.7(b) and 2.7(c) set forth below, unless and to the extent of any specific
arrangements agreed upon by the Parties in the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that the legal interest in any of the Business Assets, or any
claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, has not
been transferred or conveyed by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates to
the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date because any waiting or notice period has not expired or any consents
or approvals required for such transfer have not been obtained or waived,
then the legal interest in such Business Assets shall not be deemed to be
transferred or conveyed unless and until such waiting or notice period shall
have expired or until approval, consent or

 



32  waiver thereof is obtained. Except as set forth in Section 6.6 with respect
to Competition Filings, CFIUS Filings and all steps necessary to obtain CFIUS
Approval, and Required Nuclear Approvals, the Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, at their expense, and the Buyers shall and shall cause
their designated Affiliates to use, at the Sellers expense (including any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer that are approved in
advance by Mallinckrodt UK), commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
obtaining such consents or approvals as may be necessary to complete such
transfers as soon as practicable. The failure of the Sellers to obtain any
such required consents or approvals prior to Closing (other than as provided
in Article 7) shall not affect the Buyers obligations to close under this
Agreement or to pay, or cause to be paid, the Estimated Purchase Price.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign to the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries any legal interest in
any of the Business Assets which, as a matter of law or by the terms of any
legally binding contract, engagement or commitment to which any Seller,
Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary is subject, is not assignable
without the consent of any other party, unless such consent shall have been
given or the requirement of such consent shall have been waived in writing by
such other party.

(c) Pending the conveyances and transfers referred to in Section 2.7(b),
Mallinckrodt UK shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, hold any
such Business Assets that cannot be conveyed or transferred for the benefit
and at the risk of the Transferred Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries and
shall cooperate with the Buyers in any lawful and reasonable arrangements
designed to provide the benefits of ownership thereof to the Buyers,
including, without limitation, those arrangements that will be set forth in
and governed by the terms of any Transition Services Agreement. 

(d) Without limiting _Sections 3.11_ , _3.25_ or _6.15_ (or Buyers rights to
indemnification pursuant to _Article _ 9 with respect thereto), following the
Closing Mallinckrodt UK shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, as promptly
as practicable after the Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer, lease, license or otherwise convey each Business Asset that has
not, prior to or at the Closing, been transferred, leased, licensed or
otherwise conveyed to the Buyers or any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary, to a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary, with
no additional consideration payable to Mallinckrodt UK.

2.8 _Excluded Assets and Liabilities_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Sellers shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries to transfer to other Affiliates of
the Sellers, without consideration, any assets owned by them which are
Excluded Assets, and (ii) the Sellers shall take best efforts to ensure that
no Excluded Assets are included in the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
Indirect Subsidiaries at Closing. Any and all costs and expenses and other
liabilities incurred in transferring ownership of the Excluded Assets from the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries to other Affiliates of
the Sellers, including, but not limited to, applicable Taxes, recording and
filing fees and preparation of transfer documents, whether incurred before or
after Closing, shall be borne by Mallinckrodt UK.

 



33 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable law and regardless of whether or not
in any given circumstance the Sellers have complied fully with the
requirements of Section 2.8(a) above, the entire beneficial interest in and
to, and the risk of loss with respect to, the Excluded Assets (whether or not
owned by the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of the Indirect Subsidiaries),
shall, regardless of when legal title is transferred, pass to Mallinckrodt UK
or its designated Affiliates at Closing as of the Effective Time. All benefits
of ownership and liabilities with respect to all Excluded Assets shall be for
the account of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates at all times.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.2 and Section 8.2, in the event that the
legal interest in any of the Excluded Assets owned by the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries to be transferred or conveyed as
contemplated by this Section 2.8, or any claim, right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom cannot be transferred or conveyed to another
Affiliate of Mallinckrodt UK that is not a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date because any waiting or notice
period has not expired or any consents or approvals required for such transfer
or conveyance have not yet been obtained or waived, then the legal interest in
such Excluded Assets shall not be transferred or conveyed unless and until
such waiting period has expired or until such an approval, consent or waiver
thereof is obtained. Except as set forth in Section 6.6 with respect to
Competition Filings, CFIUS Filing, and the Nuclear Regulatory Filings,
Mallinckrodt UK shall use, and the Buyers shall use and shall cause their
Affiliates to use, all at the expense of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, waivers or approvals
as may be necessary to complete such assignments, transfers or waivers and to
obtain satisfaction of conditions to transfer as soon as practicable. Nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign to any Affiliate
of Mallinckrodt UK that is not a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary any Excluded Assets which, as a matter of law or by the terms of
any contract, engagement or commitment to which any Transferred Subsidiary or
any Indirect Subsidiary is subject, is not assignable without the consent of
any other party, unless such consents shall have been given or the requirement
for such consent shall have been waived in writing by such other party.

 

(d) Pending the conveyances and transfers referred to above in Section 2.8(c),
the Buyers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, cause the relevant
Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary to hold any such non-assignable
Excluded Assets for the benefit and at the risk of Mallinckrodt UK and its
Affiliates and to cooperate with Mallinckrodt UK in any lawful and
reasonable arrangements designed to provide the benefits of ownership thereof
to Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates, at the expense and for the account of
Mallinckrodt UK.

 

2.9 _Post-Closing Contingent Earn-Out Payment_. After Closing, the US Buyer
shall pay additional consideration for the Shares in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Schedule 2.9_.

2.10 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. Mallinckrodt UK shall bear one hundred
percent (100%) of all costs and expenses (if any) associated with the
assignment, transfer and conveyance to the Buyers and their Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries after
the Closing), and the recordation by them, of any Business Assets that are
real property (i.e., the Maryland Heights Facility and any Real Property
Leases) or any other Business Assets for which any such cost, expense
and/or recordation may be required for effective transfer.

 



34 ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

 

Sellers hereby make the following representations and warranties, each of
which shall survive the Closing Date and the transactions contemplated hereby
to the extent set forth in Section 9.6(a) below.

3.1 _Existence and Power_.

 

(a) Each Seller has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such execution, delivery and
performance has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
each Seller. Each Seller has the power and authority to effect the transfer
of the Shares owned by such Seller. Each Affiliate of the Sellers that is a
party to any Ancillary Agreement has the corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

(b) Each of the Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries and each of the
Indirect Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of formation and each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(c) Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c) (and subject to
obtaining the consents set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)), neither any

(a) This Agreement and each of the Signing Date Ancillary Agreements has been

a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Buyer party thereto,
enforceable against such Buyer in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforcement may be subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

economic risk of an investment in the Shares.

 



58 4.5 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings, orders or investigations pending
or threatened against the Buyers or any of the Buyers Affiliates, at law or

on the Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements or consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements. There are no injunctions,
decrees or unsatisfied judgments outstanding against or related to the Buyers
which could interfere with the Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by any of the Ancillary Agreements.

ARTICLE 5 

EMPLOYEES

5.1  _Employment Obligations in General_.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver to the Buyers an updated _Schedule 1.68_ to reflect any
employee resignations from or hires into the Business after the date hereof.
Employees employed by a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue their employment with
such Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary immediately following the
Effective Time. With respect to Employees who are not employed by a
Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (i) where applicable Law provides for the automatic transfer
of employment of any such Employee from the Sellers or their Affiliates to
Buyers or their Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Indirect Subsidiaries) by operation of law upon the sale of the Business, the
Buyers shall, or shall cause one of their Affiliates to, assume and honor all
terms and conditions of employment (including compensation and benefits, other
than grants of stock options, restricted stock or any other equity

 



60  or equity-based compensation or benefits) in respect of such Employee to the
extent required by such applicable Law, and the Buyers and the Sellers agree
to take any such actions as are reasonably practicable such that the
employment of such Employees will so transfer to the Buyers or their Affiliate
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries) as a
matter of law as of the Effective Time; and (ii) where applicable Law does
not provide for the automatic transfer of employment of any such Employee from
the Sellers or their Affiliates to Buyers or their Affiliates by operation of
law upon the sale of the Business, the Buyers shall, or shall cause one of
their Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect
Subsidiaries) to, make an offer of employment, to be effective as of the day
after the Closing Date, with salary or hourly wages (as applicable in any
given case) at least equal in amount to those payable by the Sellers or their
Affiliates to each such Employee on the Closing Date and with cash bonuses
and/or short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities and employee
benefits (excluding any grants of stock options, restricted stock or any
other equity or equity-based compensation or benefits, any retention
agreements, defined benefit pension, retiree welfare benefits or nonqualified
deferred compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided by the Sellers or their Affiliates to such Employee on the
Closing Date under the Benefit Plans set forth on _Disclosure Schedule
3.21(a)_ (excluding any grants of stock options, restricted stock or any
other equity or equity-based compensation or benefits, any retention
agreements, defined benefit pension, retiree welfare or nonqualified deferred
compensation) (" _Comparable Benefits_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Employee described in (ii) above who is not actively employed as of the
Closing Date shall receive an offer of employment from Buyers or one of their
Affiliates effective as of the date such Employee notifies Buyers that he or
she is able to return to active employment, with or without a reasonable
accommodation, at such terms as provided for under this Agreement or at such
other terms as required by applicable Law; provided that such date occurs no
later than six (6) months following the Closing Date or at such later date as
required by applicable Law; any such Employee shall not become a Transferred
Employee under this Agreement until commencing employment with Buyers or one
of their Affiliates. During the one-year period following the Closing, the
Buyers shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries to
provide Transferred Employees with (A) base salary or base wage during their
period of employment with the Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect
Subsidiaries in such one-year period that is no less favorable than the base
salary or base wage provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date, and (B) Comparable Benefits.

 

(b) The Buyers and the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take any and all required actions necessary to minimize to the greatest
extent practicable the possibility that severance benefits and/or government-
required termination liabilities shall be payable to an Employee as a
consequence of the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
regardless of whether such Employee becomes employed by the Buyers or one of
their Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect
Subsidiaries) automatically or by the acceptance of any offer of employment;
_provided, however_ , that to the extent the payment of severance benefits
and/or government-required termination liabilities to any such Employee is
nevertheless required as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the consequent transfers of employment,
such severance benefits and government-required termination liabilities shall
be the sole responsibility of Mallinckrodt UK unless resulting solely from
Buyers failure to provide offers or terms and conditions of employment
that would be required by Law to prevent such severance benefits or
government-required termination liabilities from arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



61 (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall abridge the Buyers right to terminate any
Transferred Employee following the Closing, but if the Buyers do so absent
cause within one (1) year after the Closing Date, then the Buyers or an
Affiliate of the Buyers shall, upon such Transferred Employees execution of a
customary release in favor of Buyers and its Affiliates, pay severance pay to
such terminated Transferred Employee who was employed in the United States an
amount that is no less favorable than two (2) weeks pay per year of service,
with a minimum of six (6) weeks of pay and a maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks
of pay. The Buyers or an Affiliate of the Buyers shall pay severance pay to
each Transferred Employee that is employed outside of the United States that
Buyers or their Affiliate terminates after the Closing in such amount as
required by applicable Law, social plan or collective labor agreement in any
relevant jurisdiction.

 

(d) The Buyers shall credit (or cause to be credited) service accrued by
Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and level of paid time off or severance benefits under their Benefit
Plans (but not for purposes of determining any accrued benefit or early
retirement eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan) and for other
purposes required by applicable Law to the extent that such service was
credited for such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date
for the same purpose under the analogous Benefit Plan and as would not result
in a duplication of benefits. 

(e) Except otherwise described in Section 5.2(e), after the Closing Date, each
Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in welfare benefit plans (including any applicable Welfare
Plans, as defined hereunder) of the Buyers or one of their Affiliates made
available to such Transferred Employees to the extent that coverage
replaces coverage under a comparable welfare benefit plan of any of the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in which such Transferred Employee
participated as of the Closing Date. For purposes of each welfare benefit plan
of the Buyers or one of their Affiliates providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, disability, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, the Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such plans to be waived for such Transferred Employee and his or her
covered dependents (other than limitations or waiting periods that were
already in effect with respect to such Employees and dependents and that have
not been satisfied as of the Closing Date).

(f) With respect to Benefit Plans in which benefits are subject to co-
payments, deductibles or similar thresholds, after the Closing Date the
Buyers or their Affiliates will, with respect to its comparable benefit plans,
use commercially reasonable efforts to give full credit for all co-payments
and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year
as if there had been a single continuous employer and shall take into account
any amounts previously paid and thresholds previously met for the benefit of
each Transferred Employee towards any applicable annual and/or lifetime
maximum benefits.

 



62 (g) During the two (2)-year period commencing with the Closing Date, the
Buyers shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to not, solicit
or attempt to solicit the employment of any employee of Mallinckrodt UK or any
of its Affiliates who is not an Employee without the prior written consent of
Mallinckrodt UK. This Section 5.1(g) shall not be construed to prohibit (i)
the Buyers and its Affiliates job postings, solicitations and advertising
designed for and distributed to the general public rather than targeted at any
employee of Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates who is not an Employee,
(ii) the Buyers or an Affiliate of Buyers hiring employees of Mallinckrodt UK
or any of its Affiliates who contact the Buyers or such Affiliate without any
solicitation of such employee by the Buyers or an Affiliate of Buyers,
including in response to solicitations addressed to the general public or
(iii) the Buyers or an Affiliate of the Buyers soliciting or hiring any such
employee of Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates whose employment with
Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates has already been terminated by Mallinckrodt
UK or its Affiliates following the Closing for any reason.

 __(a) _U.S. Transferred Employees_. Employees employed in the United States
who commence employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to

Plans of the Sellers or their Affiliates and all such persons shall
become eligible to participate in the Transferred Benefit Plans or in such
benefit plans to be established by the Buyers or one of their Affiliates in
connection with the Buyers obligations hereunder. Prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall, and shall cause one of their Affiliates to, take all actions
necessary to remove any Transferred Subsidiary and any Indirect Subsidiary as
a participating employer in any such Benefit Plan that is not a Transferred
Benefit Plan. From and after the Closing Date, Buyers and their Affiliates
(including each Transferred Subsidiary and each Indirect Subsidiary) shall
have no further liability or obligation under or with respect to any Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement
or agreement at any time sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to
be contributed to by Sellers or any of their ERISA Affiliates (other than a
Transferred Benefit Plan), and any such liabilities or obligations shall be
Excluded Liabilities under this Agreement. __

(c) Certain Benefit Plans.

 

 __(i) _Transferred Benefit Plans_. On and as of the day after the Closing
Date, the Transferred Benefit Plans for U.S. Transferred Employees shall
continue to be sponsored and maintained by a Transferred Subsidiary, an

Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates shall have no further liability or
obligation therefor. __

__(ii) _Individual Account Plans_. Mallinckrodt UK shall as of the Closing
Date, cease all contribution in respect of each U.S. Transferred Employee in
Mallinckrodt UKs or its Affiliates tax-qualified and nonqualified defined

then participating. Mallinckrodt UK shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
effective as of the day after the Closing Date, cease all __

 



63  contributions in respect of each U.S. Transferred Employee in such plans.

Each U.S. Transferred Employee who was a participant in one or more of the

participant in Buyers 401(k) Plan after the Closing Date. Buyers 401(k)
Plan shall accept rollover contributions from Mallinckrodts Savings Programs
on behalf of U.S. Transferred Employees, including a rollover of any
outstanding loan balance and related promissory notes in accordance with
reasonable procedures adopted by the Sellers and the Buyers, including a
limitation on the time period in which such loan rollovers may be elected. A
rollover from Mallinckrodts Savings Programs which includes a loan
balance and related promissory note must be initiated by a U.S. Transferred
Employee within a reasonable period following the Effective Time that is
determined by the Sellers to be acceptable and to which the Buyers consent.
Both Mallinckrodt UK (or its appropriate Affiliates) and the Buyers shall
amend their respective plans to permit the loan rollovers provided for in this
Section 5.2(c)(ii).

 

(d) _Mallinckrodt Pension Plan_. The Sellers or their Affiliates maintain one

Affiliates shall pay U.S. Transferred Employees a prorated amount, if any,
under the Mallinckrodt Global Bonus Plan based on the target award thereunder,
adjusted in Sellers sole discretion, based on performance thereunder as of

number of days elapsed during the fiscal year in which the Closing Date
occurs. Buyer shall have no liability with respect to amounts paid or earned
under such plans. Bonus and incentive compensation earned by U.S. Transferred
Employees after the Closing Date shall be pursuant to plans adopted by Buyer

attributable to such Transferred Employee and his or her dependents and

her election in effect under the Sellers benefit plan for the remainder of

applicable plan documents, and the Buyers shall, or shall cause one of their
Affiliates to, honor any such election, and the New Flex Plan shall honor any

otherwise be an eligible expense under the plan, whether or not such expense
was incurred before or after the Closing Date. __

 __(a) _Non-U.S. Transferred Employees_. Employees employed outside of the

and all such persons shall become eligible to participate in such benefit
plans to be established by the Buyers or one of their Affiliates, or to

the Buyers obligations hereunder. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, remove any Transferred Subsidiary and
any Indirect Subsidiary as a participating employer in any such Benefit Plan
that is not a Transferred Benefit Plan. From and after the Closing Date,
Buyers and their Affiliates (including each Transferred Subsidiary and each

Non-U.S. Transferred Employees with respect to all periods prior to the
Closing Date and shall, effective as of the Closing Date, cease all
contributions in respect of each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee in all Benefits

following the Closing Date. On or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall
determine and the Seller or one of its Affiliates shall pay Non-U.S.
Transferred Employees a prorated amount, if any, under the Mallinckrodt Global
Bonus Plan based on the target award thereunder, adjusted in Sellers sole
_ _

 



67  discretion based on performance thereunder as of the Closing Date, except to
the extent not administratively practicable to be paid on or before the
Closing Date by the Seller or one of its Affiliates, in which case such
amounts shall be accrued in the Closing Net Working Capital and paid by the
Buyers following the Closing Date. Such prorated amount shall be calculated
based on the number of days elapsed during the fiscal year in which the
Closing Date occurs. Buyers shall have no liability with respect to amounts
earned under such plans as of the Closing Date, except to the extent accrued
in the Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness. Bonus and

Closing Date shall be pursuant to plans adopted by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates in accordance with the otherwise applicable provisions of this
Article 5.

extent a Transferred Subsidiary or an Indirect Subsidiary is not, as of the
date hereof, the employer of any Key Employee, transfer the employment of each
such Key Employee to a Transferred Subsidiary or an Indirect Subsidiary on or
before the Closing Date. If, at any time following the date hereof and prior
to the Closing, a Key Employee resigns from his or her employment with the
Sellers or their Affiliates or the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any
of their corporate managers, directors or officers becomes aware of the
intent of any Key Employee to resign from his or her employment with the
Sellers or their Affiliates, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to retain the employment of such
Key Employee or hire a qualified replacement employee (which employee, once
hired, would be deemed a Key Employee for purposes of this _Section 5.4_ and
shall be deemed to be set forth on  _Schedule 5.4_ ). The Sellers shall not,
and shall cause their Affiliates not to, terminate the employment of any Key
Employee without the prior consent of the Buyers for any reason; _provided
that_ such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

5.5 _Vacation_. With respect to all Transferred Employees, the Buyers will
recognize (or cause to be recognized) all accrued and unused paid time off
and/or holidays which have accrued to such Transferred Employees through the
Closing Date to the extent accrued in the Closing Net Working Capital or

deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any employees of the
Sellers, the Buyers, or of any Affiliate of either, and no person other than
the Parties to this Agreement shall have any rights to enforce any provision
hereof. Further, nothing in this Article 5 shall be deemed to amend or modify
any Benefit Plan or to establish, amend or modify any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy or agreement maintained by Buyers, Sellers

hereof in the Ordinary Course, (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any
Law or duty owed to any third party or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-
client, work product or other legal privilege. The Buyers will

the business operations of the Sellers and their Affiliates that may result
from requests for access or information hereunder. The Sellers agree to keep
the Buyers reasonably apprised of the status of negotiations of the renewal
or amendment of the Material Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.2_ (the "
_Specified Agreements_ ") and agree to reasonably cooperate and consult with
the Buyers with respect to the terms of the Specified Agreements and strategy

Specified Agreements and incorporate such terms into the Specified Agreements

resolution of any such terms.

normal business hours, to all books and records of the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to,
accounting and Tax records, sales and purchase documents, notes, memoranda,
test records and any other laboratory, electronic or written data (" _Records_
"), in each case pertaining or relating to any period on or prior to the
Closing Date. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Mallinckrodt UK,
the Buyers shall not, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing or
such longer period as retention thereof is required by applicable Law,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of (or allow the destruction, alteration
or disposal of) any of the Records without first offering to surrender such
Records to Mallinckrodt UK. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in
litigation or arbitration, the provision of access to such personnel, books
and records shall be subject to applicable rules relating to discovery and
(ii) the Buyers shall not be required to provide Mallinckrodt UK or its
Affiliates or representatives with access to any information (a) that is

72 6.4 _Confidentiality; Announcements_.

 

(a) In addition to the terms, provisions and covenants of the Mutual
Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement dated February 25, 2016, between CapVest
Partners LLP, Glo Holdco S.C.A. and Mallinckrodt LLC, as amended to date (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms, each Buyer acknowledges that, in the course of
its investigations of the Business, such Buyer and its representatives have
and will become aware of confidential information and documents related to the
businesses of the Sellers and their Affiliates (including the Business), and
that its use of such confidential information and documents, or communication
of such information to third parties, could be detrimental to the businesses
of the Sellers and their Affiliates (including the Business). Each Buyer
covenants that prior to Closing or in the event that Closing does not occur,
all information and documents reviewed by such Buyer or its representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and,
following Closing, all such information and documents to the extent related
to the businesses of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Business) or any of the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities and any
confidential information otherwise known to such Buyer (including through any
Transferred Employee) with respect to businesses operated by the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates (other than the Business), shall, for a period of
three (3) years following (x) the Closing Date or (y) the date of termination
of this Agreement, as applicable, be maintained in confidence and shall not be
disclosed or used by such Buyer, and such Buyer shall cause its
representatives not to disclose or use such information, without Mallinckrodt
UKs prior written consent, unless such Buyer can demonstrate that such
information (i) is otherwise publicly available through no breach by either
Buyer or any of their Affiliates of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.4(a), (ii) is required to be disclosed pursuant to judicial order,
regulation or Law, (iii) is required to be disclosed by the rules of a
securities exchange on which such Buyer may from time to time be listed, (iv)
was already in the possession of such Buyer or its Affiliates prior to or
independently of disclosure hereunder without breach of any obligation owed to
a third party with respect to such information, or (v) is reasonably required
to be disclosed to, and only to the extent of any such required disclosure
to, any Debt Financing Source (and any Affiliate or professional advisor of
such Debt Financing Source), so long as such Debt Financing Source (and any
Affiliate or professional advisor of such Debt Financing Source) are required
to maintain the confidentiality of such information. With respect to
information and documents related to the Business, at the Sellers request in
the event that this Agreement is terminated, and, at the Sellers request at
any time with respect to information and documents related to the Excluded
Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or other businesses operated by the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates, each Buyer shall, and shall cause its
representatives to, promptly destroy all information and documents to the
extent they contain any information concerning (as applicable) the Business,
the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or other businesses operated by
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be (including any
copies thereof or extracts therefrom). In the event that any Buyer or any of
its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any information or
documents that are subject to any non-disclosure obligation set forth in this
Section 6.4(a), such Buyer shall provide the Sellers with prompt written
notice before such disclosure, if legally permissible, sufficient to enable
the Sellers or their Affiliates either to seek a protective order, at
their expense, or other appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such
disclosure or to waive compliance in writing (in whole or in part) with the
provisions of this Section 6.4. In addition to and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and at the
request and expense of the Sellers, to cooperate with the Sellers and their
Affiliates in seeking to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy
preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information. In the event of any
conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, the former shall prevail in all cases. 

 



73 (b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Mallinckrodt
UK shall maintain, and shall cause its Affiliates to maintain, in confidence
any information they may have in relation to the Business, other than with
respect to the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities, and such
information shall not be disclosed or used by Mallinckrodt UK or its
Affiliates without the Buyers prior written consent, unless Mallinckrodt UK
and its Affiliates can demonstrate such information (i) is otherwise publicly
available through no breach by Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates of
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4(b), (ii) is required to be
disclosed pursuant to judicial order, regulation or Law, or (iii) is required
to be disclosed by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other
exchange on which the securities of Mallinckrodt UKs ultimate parent company
is listed. In the event that Mallinckrodt UK or any of its representatives
becomes legally compelled to disclose any information or documents that are
subject to any non-disclosure obligation set forth in this Section 6.4(b),
Mallinckrodt UK shall provide the Buyers with prompt written notice before
such disclosure, if legally permissible, sufficient to enable the Buyers or
their Affiliates either to seek a protective order, at their expense, or
other appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive
compliance in writing (in whole or in part) with the provisions of this
Section 6.4. In addition to and in furtherance of the foregoing, Mallinckrodt
UK shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and at the request and expense
of the Buyers, to cooperate with the Buyers and their Affiliates in seeking to
obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy preventing or
prohibiting such disclosure or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information.

 

(c) No Party shall, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates not to, make any
public announcement at any time concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein without the prior written approval of the other Parties
(which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) and without giving the
other Parties a meaningful opportunity (as practicable under the
circumstances) to review and comment on any such proposed public
announcement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event
any Party reasonably determines that any such public announcement is required
by Law, such Party shall give the other Parties advance written notice of,
and a meaningful opportunity (as practicable under the circumstances) to
review and comment on, the proposed form and substance of any such
announcement. The Party whose proposed announcement is the subject of review
shall consider carefully and in good faith all comments timely received from
the other Parties, but nothing shall interfere with the right of any Party
making any public announcement from making the final determination as to the
form and nature of any public disclosure it feels is legally required. The
Parties do plan to issue a press release (either independently or jointly)
promptly after the execution of this Agreement, and in that regard each Party
has reviewed and commented on the other Partys proposed press release in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this Section 6.4(c).

(d) Each Party acknowledges that any breach by it of the confidentiality
obligations set forth in this Section 6.4 may cause the other Parties
irreparable harm for which compensation by monetary damages would be
inadequate and, therefore, any Party that has been harmed by any such breach
shall have the right to seek an injunction or

 



74  decree for specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as
a remedy for any such breach and each of the Parties further agrees to waive
any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for
breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity to each of the Parties.

 

6.5 _Cooperation_. On or after the Closing Date, the Parties shall, on
request, cooperate with one another by furnishing any additional information,
executing and delivering any additional documents and instruments, including
contract assignments, and doing any and all such other things as may be
reasonably requested by the Parties or their counsel to consummate or
otherwise implement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
event any Buyer, Transferred Subsidiary, any of the Indirect Subsidiaries, or
Sellers become aware after the Closing Date of any Intellectual Property that
qualifies as Business Intellectual Property but was not included in the
Business Assets assigned to Buyers or owned by a Transferred Subsidiary or an
Indirect Subsidiary at Closing, Mallinckrodt UK shall execute and deliver, or
cause its applicable Affiliate to execute and deliver, all instruments and
documents reasonably necessary in connection with (i) in the case of
Intellectual Property owned by Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates,
transferring all right, title, and interest of such Business Intellectual
Property to Buyers or their designee, or (ii) in the case of Business
Intellectual Property owned by a third person, and subject to Sections 2.7(b)
and 2.7(c), assigning to Buyers or their designee(s) Sellers rights to use
such Business Intellectual Property.

6.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Certain Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable
after the date hereof, all documents necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and (ii) taking all steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, authorizations and approvals.

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party agrees (i) as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties) to cause
its ultimate parent entity make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein (" _HSR Filing_ "), and to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested in connection with the HSR Filing, and to take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act with respect to the contemplated
transaction as soon as reasonably practicable, and (ii) (A) as promptly as
practicable to submit to CFIUS a draft joint voluntary notice under FINSA with
respect to the

  



75  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) file, as promptly as
practicable, with the CFIUS a joint voluntary notice under FINSA (the " _CFIUS
Filing_ "), (C) supply, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any additional
information and documents that may be requested in connection with the CFIUS
review and, if applicable, investigation process, and (D) take all other
actions necessary to obtain the CFIUS Approval with respect to the
contemplated transaction as soon as reasonably practicable. Also in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make, with the Buyers
having primary responsibility for the making of other such filings, as soon
as reasonably practicable, but no later than thirty (30) Business Days after
the date hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties or
unless an earlier date is required by applicable Laws) (x) such other
appropriate filings (together with the HSR Filing, the " _Competition
Filings_ ") with respect to jurisdictions outside the United States as are
reasonably necessary under any applicable Laws regarding competitive or
antitrust matters or relating to the control or approval of mergers or other
business combinations as may be in effect in any applicable jurisdiction (such
Laws, together with the HSR Act, " _Competition Laws_ ") to obtain all waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
authorizations and approvals required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein ( _provided that_ , where the relevant Competition Laws
require or expect the Buyers to enter into pre-notification discussions or
require a pre-acceptance period, the thirty (30) Business Day period shall
refer to the submission of the draft filing, notice, application or similar
document), to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested in connection with
any such Competition Filing, and to take all other actions necessary to cause
any approval or clearance to be obtained in connection with any
such Competition Filing as soon as practicable and (y) such appropriate
filings with the Governmental Authorities (both in the United States and in
any jurisdictions outside the United States) as are reasonably necessary under
any applicable Radiation Safety Laws as may be in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction (collectively, the " _Nuclear Regulatory Filings_ ") to obtain
all Required Nuclear Approvals with respect to the contemplated transaction as
soon as reasonably practicable, to supply as promptly as practicable and
advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with any such Nuclear Regulatory Filing, and to take
all other actions reasonably necessary to cause any approval or clearance to
be obtained in connection with any such Nuclear Regulatory Filing as soon as
practicable.

(c) Each Party shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
6.6(a) and Section 6.6(b), (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each
other Party in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing outside counsel for the other Parties to
have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of
filings and submissions, (ii) promptly inform outside counsel for the other
Parties of any material communication received by such Party from, or given by
such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), CFIUS, or any other
Governmental Authority, by promptly providing copies to outside counsel for
the other Parties of any such written communications, and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, (iii) permit outside
counsel for the other Parties to review in advance any material communication
that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting,
substantive telephone call 

 



76  or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC, CFIUS, or any other Governmental
Authority, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person ( _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns) and (iv) to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC, CFIUS, or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or other person, give outside counsel for the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ,
the FTC, CFIUS, or any other Authority or other person.

 

(d) In furtherance of the covenants of the Parties contained in Section
6.6(a), Section 6.6(b) and Section 6.6(c), each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated herein under any applicable Law,
including (but, with respect to the Buyers only, without regard to
the "reasonable best efforts" qualifier set out in this Section 6.6(d) in so
far as it relates to resolving objections raised in respect of Competition
Filings or any other merger control review subject, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the proviso in 6.6(d)(i) and to the Buyers ability to determine
their strategy with regard to resolving objections having duly cooperated with
the Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.6(d)) agreeing to
any terms, conditions or modifications (including the Buyers, the Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates having to cease operating, licensing,
selling or otherwise disposing of any assets or businesses (including the
requirement that any such assets or businesses be held separate)) with
respect to obtaining the expiration or termination of any waiting period or
any consents, clearances, waivers, approvals or authorizations in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyers, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates to cease operating, sell,
license or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of any European Plant
or to offer or commit to any such action and (ii) the Sellers shall not be
required to take such actions under Section 6.6(a), Section 6.6(b), Section
6.6(c) and this Section 6.6(d) that would result in, or would be reasonably
likely to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on any of the other businesses of the Sellers and their
Affiliates. Nothing in Section 6.6(a), Section 6.6(b), Section 6.6(c) or
this Section 6.6(d) shall require a Party or its Affiliates to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to all communications and
strategy relating to the Competition Filings, CFIUS Filing and Nuclear
Regulatory Filings, including, without limitation, by causing their respective
counsel to consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another regarding the form and content of any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Competition Filing, Competition Law,
CFIUS Filing, FINSA or Nuclear Regulatory Filing prior to their submission.

 

(e) The Buyers shall not (and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to) enter
into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction involving
any merger or acquisition of shares or assets of any entity engaged in a
business which is directly competitive with the Business that might reasonably
be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time required,
to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, or in connection with any other Competition Filing or in connection
with the CFIUS Filing or any Nuclear Regulatory Filing, applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

 



77  (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) obtain all authorizations,
consents, waivers, and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

6.7 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

 

(a) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date and anywhere where the Sellers
and/or their Affiliates have made sales in respect of the Business in the 12
months prior to the date of this Agreement, Mallinckrodt UK shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, on their own behalf
or on behalf of any other person, own any interest in, manage, control,
participate in (whether as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, agent,
representative or otherwise), render services to or otherwise engage in any
activities that are directly competitive with the Business (as conducted by
the Sellers and their Affiliates on and as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing) (" _Competitive Activities_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Buyer hereby agrees that the covenant set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence shall not be deemed to prohibit any of the following: (i)
Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates providing services to any Buyer or its
Affiliates under or participating in any other arrangement contemplated by the
Transition Services Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, (ii) the
ownership or acquisition by Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates of any
firm, person or entity which engages, directly or indirectly, in Competitive
Activities if such Competitive Activities account for less than fifteen
percent (15%) of such persons consolidated annual revenues in any given
calendar year (provided that, in no event shall Mallinckrodt UK or any of its
Affiliates own or acquire any interest in the persons set forth on _Schedule
6.7(a)_ ; provided further that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 6.7(a), the foregoing restriction shall not
prohibit Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates from owning or acquiring any
direct or indirect parent company or Affiliate of any person or business set
forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ if (and only if) such parent company or Affiliate
owns and operates material revenue-generating businesses in addition to a
nuclear imaging business), (iii) Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates
engaging in any business (other than the Business), whether or not any one or
more products or services associated with such business activities might be
deemed to be competitive in some manner with the Competitive Activities, (iv)
manufacturing and supplying to third parties raw materials, active
pharmaceutical ingredients or intermediate compounds (but not finished
products ready for distribution and sale and intended for use in connection
with the diagnostic imaging of human ailments) whether or not any of the
foregoing are used by such third party in connection with Competitive
Activities and (v) the acquisition by Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates of
rights to any product (whether by purchase, license or otherwise) that may be
used for Competitive Activities, as long as either such product is not so
employed or is a product that falls within the exception set forth in clause
(ii) of this sentence as if any such product was an acquired entity or person
for purposes of such clause (ii). In the event that Mallinckrodt UK or any of
its Affiliates acquires (A) any firm, person, product or entity which is
engaged in Competitive Activities in excess of the threshold permitted by
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence or by clause (v) of the
immediately preceding sentence if a product is involved that falls within the
exception set forth in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence or
(B) any direct or indirect parent company or Affiliate of any person set
forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ (regardless of

 



78  whether or not such parent company or affiliate is engaged in Competitive
Activities in excess of the threshold in clause (ii)), the acquisition and
ownership of such a firm, person, product or entity shall not violate this
Section 6.7 so long as Mallinckrodt UK and/or its Affiliates use their best
efforts to divest any such product or portion of that firm, person or entity
that is involved in such Competitive Activities within eighteen (18) months
after such acquisition.

(b) If Mallinckrodt UK experiences a Change of Control and the third party
involved in such Change of Control or any of its Affiliates immediately prior
to such Change of Control (collectively, the " _Mallinckrodt UK Acquirer_ ")
is engaging in Competitive Activities (each, a " _Mallinckrodt UK Acquirer
Competitive Activity_ "), then notwithstanding Section 6.7(a), the
Mallinckrodt UK Acquirer (but not Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Change of Control, except to the extent Mallinckrodt
UK or any of its Affiliates is then engaging in any such Mallinckrodt UK
Acquirer Competitive Activity in a manner that complies with Section 6.7(a))
may continue to engage in any such Mallinckrodt UK Acquirer Competitive
Activity.

 

(c) Without limiting the remedies available, the Parties agree that damages at
law would be an insufficient remedy in the event of breach of this Section
6.7 by Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates and that the Buyers shall be entitled
to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such
breach or threatened breach.

 

(d) If any of the provisions of this Section 6.7 are held to be unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, then, as to such jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of its unenforceability in such jurisdiction,
without affecting the remaining provisions of this Section 6.7 in such
jurisdiction, or affecting in any other jurisdiction the validity
or enforceability of such provision or of this Section 6.7.

6.8 _Use of the Seller Marks_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.8, Mallinckrodt UK, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants a limited, worldwide, non-
exclusive, fully paid, non-royalty bearing right and license to the Buyers
and, subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.8(a)_, the Transferred
Subsidiaries, Indirect Subsidiaries, and their Affiliates, for the shorter of
(a) a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date (subject to the
last sentence of this _Section 6.8(a)_) and (b) the period required to
implement variations to the Marketing Authorizations to allow the Buyers to
discontinue using the Seller Marks for the products covered by the Marketing
Authorizations, be able to use the Seller Marks solely (i) as a component of
the existing legal entity names of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Indirect Subsidiaries, and (ii) in connection with the operation of the
Business as conducted, or as proposed to be conducted by Buyers, as of the
date of this Agreement, including to market, distribute, and sell product
inventory included in the Business Assets or any product inventory acquired
or manufactured by the Buyers and/or their Affiliates after the Closing Date
and to utilize the labels and packaging, advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials included in the Business Assets. Buyers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, use the Seller Marks in accordance with
standards of quality consistent with the quality standards observed by Sellers
and their Affiliates in the operation of the Business prior to the Effective
Date, and all uses of the Seller Marks shall be in a form and manner designed
to maintain the high quality of the Seller

 



79  Marks and in keeping with the image, reputation and goodwill symbolized by
and associated with the Seller Marks, in each case to the extent such
standards, form, and manner have been made available by Mallinckrodt UK to
Buyer. Upon reasonable advance written notice from Mallinckrodt UK of any
failure of such uses of the Seller Marks to conform to the foregoing standard,
Buyers shall promptly discontinue such non-conforming uses and make such
changes to the applicable products or such uses as Mallinckrodt UK shall
reasonably require. All goodwill arising out of use by Buyers or any of their
Affiliates of the Seller Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of
Mallinckrodt UK. As of the Closing, Buyers shall be responsible for all use
of the Seller Marks by any Transferred Subsidiary, any Indirect Subsidiary, or
any of its or their Affiliates, and if at any time during the term of the
license granted pursuant to this Section 6.8(a), any Transferred Subsidiary,
any Indirect Subsidiary, or any or any of its or their Affiliates is no longer
an Affiliate of Buyers or should cease to exist, such prior Affiliate shall
immediately thereupon cease to have the right to use or exploit the Seller
Marks.

(b) Promptly upon the expiration of the period set forth in Section 6.8(a),
the Buyers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, where practical and
compliant with applicable Laws and any applicable Marketing Authorizations,
over-label any use of Seller Marks on product labels and advertising,
marketing, sales and promotional materials in its possession or under its
control and, where the foregoing is not practical or is legally impossible,
the Buyers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, destroy and dispose of
all labels and all advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials,
in its possession or subject to its control, bearing any of the Seller Marks.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 6.8, in no event shall the
Buyers or any of their designated Affiliates (i) use any Seller Marks in any
manner, for any purpose, or in connection with any products materially
different from the use of such Seller Marks by the Sellers and their
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) manufacture or
produce, or cause or permit any third party to manufacture or produce, any new
advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials using or
otherwise incorporating any Seller Marks. Neither the Buyers nor any of their
Affiliates will take any action or omit to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the Seller Marks to be disparaged or
that would reasonably be expected to diminish the value of the goodwill
associated with the Seller Marks (which each Buyer acknowledges will accrue
solely to the benefit of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates) or that would
reasonably be expected to interfere in any manner with the use by
Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates of the Seller Marks.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that
this Agreement does not, and shall not, convey, transfer or assign any right,
title or interest in any trademark, name, or logo of any third party.

 

(e) Within two (2) months after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall (i) remove
all Seller Marks from all websites or website content included in the
Business Assets and (ii) disable all links in any such website to websites
maintained by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 



80 (f) Within the shorter of (a) a period of three (3) years following the
Closing Date (subject to Section 6.8(f)) and (b) the period required to
implement variations to the Marketing Authorizations to allow the Buyers to
discontinue using corporate or entity names that include the Seller Marks for
the products covered by the Marketing Authorizations, the Buyers shall have
filed all documentation necessary to change the legal current corporate or
entity names of the Transferred Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries to
remove from said corporate or entity names any reference to the Seller Names.
So long as Buyers are and remain in compliance with their obligations under
this _Section 6.8_, then if, despite using commercially reasonable efforts to
do so, Buyers have been unable to implement variations to the Marketing
Authorizations to allow the Buyers to discontinue using corporate entity names
that include the Seller Marks for the products covered by the Marketing
Authorizations within the three (3) year period following the Closing
Date, Buyers may, by written notice to Mallinckrodt UK no less than sixty
(60) days prior to the end of the initial license term or any then-current
Renewal Entity Name License Term, elect to extend the license granted in
Section 6.8(a)(i) in increments of up to six (6) additional months (each, a "
_Renewal Entity Name License Term_ "); provided, however, that Buyers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to discontinue use of the Seller Marks
licensed under Section 6.8(a)(i) as soon as reasonably practicable; and
provided further than in no event may the license granted under Section
6.8(a)(i) be extended for a total of more than one (1) year beyond the initial
three (3) year period following the Closing Date. Upon request of
Mallinckrodt UK after the two-year period mentioned above or any Renewal
Entity Name License Term, the Buyers shall provide Mallinckrodt UK with any
documents evidencing such change and the filing of such change with the
relevant Governmental Authorities. For the avoidance of doubt, uses of the
Seller Names pursuant to this Section 6.8(f) shall be limited to uses in
connection with legal documents and other uses for which a
Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary is required to use its legal
name and nothing in this Section 6.8(f) shall be deemed to grant Buyers or any
Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary the right to use or employ any
of the Seller Names as a trademark or service mark for purposes of selling,
offering for sale, advertising, marketing, distribution or promotion of
products or services.

 

6.9 _The Sellers  Guarantees_. Following the Closing Date, the Buyers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the complete release and
discharge of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates from all obligations
(including any obligations upon any renewal or extension) to the extent solely
related to the Business which are set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ , except
for any such obligations included in the Excluded Liabilities (the " _Seller
Support Instruments_ "). In the event that the Buyers are unable to obtain any
such release, each Buyer agrees that (i) the term of any such Seller
Support Instrument shall not be extended and no such Seller Support
Instrument shall otherwise be modified in a manner which would expand the
financial exposure of Mallinckrodt UK or its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries), (ii) it shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to substitute itself or an Affiliate as
primary guarantor of the obligations underlying such Seller Support
Instruments, and (iii) it shall indemnify and hold Mallinckrodt UK and its
Affiliates harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred by them after
the Closing arising out of any claims under the Seller Support Instruments.
The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, keep in place any
Seller Support Instrument until the earlier of (a) expiration by its terms of
such Seller Support Instrument (other than any expiry caused by the exercise
of a voluntary right by a Seller or its Affiliates to terminate or accept the
termination of the obligations underlying such Seller Support Instrument or
the Seller Support Instrument as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) or (b) the date on which Buyers provide written confirmation
to Mallinckrodt UK that such Seller Support Instrument has been fully and
unconditionally released. Mallinckrodt

 



81  UK shall promptly reimburse the Buyers and their Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries) for all bank fees,
breakage, penalty and settlement costs and any legal fees charged to or
incurred by Buyers or their Affiliates, up to One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000 (exclusive of service taxes), in satisfying their obligations under
this _Section 6.9_.

 

6.10 _Insurance Policies_. Each Buyer acknowledges that none of the insurance
policies and other insurance coverage relative to the Business, the Business
Assets and the Employees carried by the Sellers and their Affiliates on and as
of the date hereof (and on and as of the Closing) will be transferred to the
Buyers or their Affiliates (including to the Transferred Subsidiaries or
Indirect Subsidiaries to be acquired hereunder) on and as of and as a
consequence of the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder but,
rather, except for any tail or extended coverages existing solely for the
benefit of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates covering acts or omissions to
act occurring prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled by Mallinckrodt
UK and its Affiliates on and as of the Effective Time, and the cost or benefit
associated with any such cancellations shall be entirely for the account of
Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates. Thus, it shall be the obligation and
responsibility of the Buyers, from and after the Closing Date, to provide
insurance coverage for the Business, the Business Assets, the Transferred
Subsidiaries, and the Indirect Subsidiaries and with respect to all employees
of the Business as it shall deem necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, Mallinckrodt UK shall retain all
rights to control its and its Affiliates insurance policies and programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
programs, notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to any
liabilities of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates.

6.11 _Local Transfer Documents_.

(a) At Closing, the Sellers and the Buyers shall, or shall cause one of their
Affiliates to, execute such agreements, transfers and other documents as
necessary (subject to relevant local Laws and otherwise as may be agreed
between the Sellers and the Buyers) to implement the transfer of the Shares,
in the case of the Netherlands Shares including but not limited to (i) a
notarial deed of transfer of the Netherlands Shares under Dutch law before a
Notary and (ii) a confirmation statement signed by Mallinckrodt UK and the
Netherlands Buyer confirming that the conditions precedent to Closing have
all either been fulfilled or waived and that the Distribution pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) is complete and that, as a result of this, the sale of the
Netherlands Shares is deemed to have occurred (the " _Local Transfer
Documents_ "). 

(b) To the extent that the provisions of a Local Transfer Document are
inconsistent with or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in
accordance with this Agreement) additional to the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in the event of any
conflict or inconsistency.

 

(c) At Closing, Mallinckrodt UK shall deliver to the Notary duly executed
written shareholders resolutions of Mallinckrodt Netherlands and
Mallinckrodt Medical B.V. respectively: (i) accepting the resignations of
members of their management boards (other than any persons designated by the
Buyers at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing) with effect from
the Effective Time and granting such members full and final

 



82  discharge (decharge) for their activities as board members; and (ii)
appointing any new member(s) of the management boards of Mallinckrodt
Netherlands and Mallinckrodt Medical B.V. respectively (as designated by the
Buyers at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing) with effect from
the Effective Time.

 

(d) At Closing, the Netherlands Buyer shall deliver to the Notary data cards
duly executed by the person(s) appointed in the resolutions referred to in
Section 6.11(c) as new member(s) of the management boards of Mallinckrodt
Netherlands and Mallinckrodt Medical B.V. respectively with effect from the

deliver to the Sellers copies of all agreements evidencing the

doubt, the Buyer Financing) by or to the Buyers excuse the Buyers from
performance of any of their respective obligations hereunder.

9.2  _Indemnification by the Buyers_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article 9, from and after the Closing the Buyers, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify and hold harmless Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates, and
their respective directors, officers, employees, successors, transferees and
assigns against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from:

 

(a) any breach or violation by any Buyer of the covenants made in this
Agreement by the Buyers not covered elsewhere in this Section 9.2, including
without limitation any failure by the Buyers to perform any of their
obligations under Section 6.9, except to the extent Mallinckrodt UK is
reimbursed for Losses under any Letter of Credit,

 

(b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
set forth in Article 4, treating such representations and warranties as
though made as of the Closing Date,

(c) Excluded Taxes, but without duplication of any amounts paid pursuant
to Section 2.5; and

 



93 (d) RandD Lab Construction Pre-Closing Costs and the IT Carve-Out Pre-Closing
Costs, to the extent not reflected in the Final Closing Statement or
otherwise reimbursed.

9.3 _Notice and Payment of Losses_. The person that believes it is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 (the " _Injured Party_ ") shall
promptly notify the Party who may be liable for such indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such Loss which the Injured Party has
determined has given or could give rise to a claim under Section 9.1 or 9.2
(such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a " _Notice of Claim_
"); _provided, however_ , that failure of an Injured Party timely to give a
Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from its indemnity obligations set forth in this Article 9 except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such
delay. If, prior to giving a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party, the
Injured Party settles any third party claims, the Indemnifying Party shall be
released from its indemnity obligation with respect thereto. A Notice
of Claim shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent known by the
Injured Party, the nature and, to the extent reasonably calculable, estimated
amount of any such claim giving rise to a right of indemnification. The
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligation to make payment for any claim
for indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.2, as the case may be, within
thirty (30) days of its receipt of a Notice of Claim; _provided, however_ ,
that for so long as the Indemnifying Party is either (x) with respect to any
Notice of Claim disputing its responsibility to indemnify the other Party or
disputing the amount of any claim for indemnification or (y) with respect to
any Notice of Claim that involves a third-party claim, defending a third-
party claim in good faith pursuant to Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Partys
obligations to make payment to the Injured Party with respect thereto shall be
suspended until either, with respect to clause (x) of this sentence, the
Indemnifying Party has accepted responsibility for indemnification and has
agreed upon the amount of such indemnification or, with respect to both
clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence (as applicable), a final nonappealable
determination related to such Notice of Claim that is binding on the
Indemnifying Party is given by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) Business Days (or such shorter
period of time that the Injured Party may be required to respond to any suit
or governmental action) after receipt of a Notice of Claim to notify the
Injured Party (A) whether or not it disputes its obligation to indemnify the
Injured Party with respect to such Notice of Claim and (B) whether it elects
to defend any third-party claim that forms the basis for any such Notice of
Claim pursuant to Section 9.4.

 

9.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. With respect to any action or any claim
set forth in a Notice of Claim relating to a third-party claim and subject to
and consistent with any applicable provisions of Section 9.3 herein above, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its expense, any such
claim or demand, and the Injured Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate (but not control), at its own expense, in the
defense of any such third-party claim; _provided that_ , prior to assuming
control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party verifies, in writing, to the
Injured Party that such Indemnifying Party shall provide indemnification to
the Injured Party with respect to the Proceeding giving rise to such Notice of
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails timely to notify the Injured Party of
its election to defend any third-party claim, the Injured Party shall, upon
written notice to the Indemnifying Party, have the right to undertake the
defense or settlement of such claim for the account and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume
the

 



94  defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof, but only if such assumption would not materially prejudice the
defense of such claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending any
such third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Injured Party (which shall not unreasonably be withheld),
settle or compromise any third-party claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include an express and unconditional release from
liability in respect of the Injured Party with prejudice or which imposes any
injunctive or equitable relief against the Injured Party (including any terms
or conditions that might restrict or limit the conduct of business by the
Injured Party). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section
9.3 or in Section 9.4, if a third party has unequivocally and in writing
offered to settle a third-party claim on a basis consistent with the
requirements of the preceding sentence and for the payment of a definite
amount, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such claim
without receiving the consent of the Injured Party. If such claim is settled
by the Injured Party without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent,
and such prior written consent is required pursuant to the terms of this
Section 9.4, the Injured Party shall be deemed to have waived all rights
hereunder for indemnification arising out of such claim. The Injured Party
shall make available to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives all
records and other materials reasonably required for use in contesting
any third-party claim. The Injured Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of all such claims. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for any
Losses if and to the extent that they arise from action taken or omitted to
be taken by the Injured Party in bad faith or fraudulently. With respect to
any third-party claims that are Proceedings with respect to the Business that
are outstanding as of the Closing Date and for which Mallinckrodt UK has the
explicit obligation to indemnify the Buyers and their Affiliates under any of
Section 9.1(f), Section 9.1(g) or Section 9.1(l) above, Mallinckrodt UK shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, continue with the defense of such third-
party claims after the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the defense of
such claims on or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such manner is
consistent with both Section 9.3 above and this Section 9.4. Notwithstanding
anything else set forth in this Section 9.4 to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to defend any action or claim set forth in a
Notice of Claim (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Injured
Party) if and to the extent, with respect to any portion of such action or
claim, (A) the claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
quasi criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
(B) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Injured
Party (other than equitable claims that are ancillary to claims for monetary
damages which are the primary relief sought); (C) the Injured Party has been
advised in writing by an independent counsel that a reasonable likelihood
exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Injured Party; or (D) upon petition by the Injured Party an appropriate court
rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend such claim. In addition to the foregoing, an Injured Party
shall have the right to retain control of the defense of a third-party claim
which is subject to the Cap in those instances where such Injured Party would
reasonably be expected to have Losses in an amount that is at least two times
the remaining amount available under the Cap; provided, that if the Injured
Party exercises this right, it shall (x) reasonably consult with
the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of such third-party claim
and (y) not admit any liability with respect to such third-party claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent there
is a conflict between the provisions of this Section 9.4, on the one hand, and
the provisions of Section 2.5(e), on the other hand, with respect to any Tax
Claim, the provisions of Section 2.5(e) shall govern.

 



95 9.5 _Environmental Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) With respect to any of the matters covered by any Notice of Claim sent by
the Buyers after the Closing Date that relate to any liability under any
Environmental Laws for which Mallinckrodt UK is liable to indemnify Buyers and
their Affiliates pursuant to Section 9.1(g) or 9.1(h) above (" _Environmental
Indemnity Matters_ "), the Buyers shall give Mallinckrodt UK a written Notice
of Claim of any remedial, corrective or similar action proposed or required by
any relevant Governmental Authority or other third party or otherwise pursuant
to Environmental Laws (" _Environmental Action_ ") that might give rise to a
claim by the Buyers for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(g) or 9.1(h)
hereof, which notice shall be in reasonable detail, shall be given in
accordance with the claim period limitations set forth in Section 9.6(c)
and shall be provided promptly after the Buyers or any of their Affiliates
become aware of any Environmental Action (but no later than thirty (30) days
thereafter) or of any facts and circumstances that might reasonably give rise
to any Environmental Action; _provided that_ , the Buyers failure to so
notify the Sellers shall not relieve Mallinckrodt UK of its obligations under
this Agreement, except to the extent that such failure to notify shall have
actually and materially prejudiced Mallinckrodt UK.

(b) With respect to any Environmental Indemnity Matters for which Mallinckrodt
UK receives a Notice of Claim covered by Section 9.5(a), Mallinckrodt UK, at
its sole discretion, shall have the right to assume overall primary management
and control of such Environmental Indemnity Matter from and after the date
upon which Mallinckrodt UK accepts responsibility to indemnify the Buyers
with respect to such Environmental Indemnity Matter, as determined in
accordance with this Section 9.5. In the event that any Notice of Claim
relates to any third party action of which the Buyers have been notified, and
in addition to any procedures set forth in this Section 9.5, such third-party
claim will be handled in a manner consistent with Section 9.4 above;
_provided, that_ , in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the
provisions of Section 9.4 and this Section 9.5, Section 9.5 shall prevail,
absent specific written agreement of the Parties to the contrary. If
Mallinckrodt UK exercises its right to overall primary management and control
of an Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action, the Buyers
shall be kept informed of all significant events occurring and actions taken
with respect thereto and the Buyers shall have the right to prior approval
with respect to any action proposed to be taken by Mallinckrodt UK with
respect to any such Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action to
the extent such action (i) might reasonably interfere in any material way with
the business activities of the Buyers or their Affiliates at any owned or
leased site or (ii) might reasonably cause the Buyers or their Affiliates to
take any actions that might require significant expenditure of funds or
incremental utilization of resources. If the Buyers refuse unreasonably to
consent to any action that Mallinckrodt UK deems reasonably necessary in
connection with any Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action,
then the dispute mechanism in Section 9.5(f) shall apply. The Buyers agree
to grant reasonable access to Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates (and its and
their representatives) to the Buyers and their Affiliates facilities during
normal working hours to allow Mallinckrodt UK to discharge its obligations
under this Section 9.5, pursuant to any access agreement that may be entered
into by Mallinckrodt UK and the Buyers. Mallinckrodt UK agrees (on behalf of
itself, its Affiliates, and its and their representatives) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid any disruption to the Buyers and their
Affiliates business activities in performing its obligations hereunder.

 



96 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, any Environmental Indemnity
Matter will be indemnifiable only to the extent that it represents a
violation of or would give rise to liability under Environmental Laws in
effect as of or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) At the time when the Buyers deliver a Notice of Claim to Mallinckrodt UK
with respect to an Environmental Indemnity Matter, the Buyers agree to
provide to Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates such material documents and
other data and information the Buyers have available that relate to evolution
of the claim, subject to both the Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK taking whatever
actions are reasonably necessary to avoid the loss or waiver of any privilege
the Buyers may have against disclosure of any such documents, data or
information to any third party whose position may reasonably be considered
adverse to the Buyers.

 

(e) Consistent with Section 9.5(b) above, if Mallinckrodt UK does not exercise
its right to primary management and control of an Environmental Indemnity
Matter or Environmental Action, the Buyers shall, in connection with any
Environmental Action, utilize the most cost-effective methods and technologies
applicable and reasonably available to perform any remediation, corrective
action or similar actions that meet the standards of and are required to
attain compliance with applicable Environmental Law. Mallinckrodt UK shall not
be responsible to indemnify the Buyers for the incremental cost of
remediation, corrective or similar actions that are more restrictive or
onerous than those cost-effective methods and technologies required under and
to attain compliance with Environmental Laws, as interpreted consistently with
the requirements of Section 9.5(b) above. In the event that Mallinckrodt UK
has exercised its right to assume overall primary management and control of an
Environmental Indemnity Matter consistent with Section 9.5(b), if the Buyers,
without otherwise obtaining Mallinckrodt UKs prior written permission,
except in an emergency, elect to perform any remediation, corrective or
similar actions relative to any Environmental Action (whether or not in a
manner more restrictive or more onerous than the standard set forth in the
first sentence of this Section 9.5(e) in any given case), it may do so
(provided such election does not interfere with the performance by
Mallinckrodt UK of any of its obligations hereunder), but the costs
and expenses attributable to that portion of any such Environmental Action
accomplished by the Buyers shall not be subject to indemnification by
Mallinckrodt UK hereunder.

 

(f) To the extent there is a dispute between the Parties over whether, with
respect to any site or sites which are the subject of an Environmental
Action, any action taken by Mallinckrodt UK, the Buyers or their Affiliates
(or its or their representatives) meets the standard set forth in Section
9.5(e) above or is otherwise inconsistent with Environmental Laws
(as interpreted in a manner consistent with Section 9.5(b)), the Parties
shall in good faith attempt to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days of
the date any such dispute arises (or at the end of such additional period as
the parties shall mutually agree in writing) and, upon failing to do so, the
Parties shall promptly select (each time such a dispute arises) an independent
third party and mutually acceptable environmental consultant (" _Third Party
Consultant_ ") who shall, on the basis of whatever scientific, legal or other
information the Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK shall individually choose to submit
to the Third Party Consultant for consideration and applying the 

 



97  most cost-effective methods and technologies available to perform any
remediation, corrective action or similar actions that still meet the
appropriate standard under applicable Environmental Law (the " _Determination
Criteria_ "), select the position of the Party that, applying the
Determination Criteria is correct with respect to each element of any dispute.
The decision of the Third Party Consultant as contemplated hereunder shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The costs and expenses of the Third Party
Consultant in acting pursuant to this Section 9.5(f) shall be borne equally by
the Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK. The Buyers and Mallinckrodt UK shall not
be required on any occasion to select any firm to act as Third Party
Consultant hereunder that has previously acted in such capacity in accordance
herewith.

 

9.6 _Survival and Claim Periods_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 and Article 4
hereof shall survive the Closing Date until March 31, 2018, it being the
express intent of the Parties to shorten the applicable statute of limitations
under applicable Law with respect to claims relating to a breach or inaccuracy
of such representations and warranties (and the remedies hereunder with
respect thereto), except that (i) the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8(a), 3.9(a) (second sentence only), 3.24,
4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 shall survive the Closing Date until the date that is fifteen
(15) years from the Closing Date, it being the express intent of the Parties
to extend the applicable statute of limitations under applicable Law with
respect to claims relating to a breach or inaccuracy of such representations
and warranties (and the remedies hereunder with respect thereto) ("
_Perpetual Representations_ ") and (ii) the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.6 shall survive the Closing Date until the date that is
thirty (30) days following the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations with respect to any given representation and warranty within such
Section 3.6, without giving effect to any tolling or extension of any statute
of limitations that may occur due solely to any actions or omissions to act
by the Buyers or any of their Affiliates. Any Notice of Claim pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b) or 9.2(b) (as applicable) for breach of any representation or
warranty must be made on or before the expiration of any survival period
applicable to such representation and warranty or no claim for indemnification
for such breach will be available hereunder.

(b) No claim by a Buyer for indemnity pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or 9.1(e)
or by Mallinckrodt UK pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) or 9.2(c) shall be effective
unless a Notice of Claim with respect to an indemnifiable matter thereunder is
given by the Buyers or Mallinckrodt UK (as applicable) in accordance herewith
prior to the date that is thirty (30) days following the end of any applicable
statute of limitations governing such claim, without giving effect to any
tolling or extension of any statute of limitations that may occur due solely
to any actions or omissions to act by the Buyers or any of their Affiliates,
with respect to a Notice of Claim by the Buyers, or by Mallinckrodt UK or its
Affiliates, with respect to a Notice of Claim by Mallinckrodt UK.

(c) A Notice of Claim may be filed after the Closing Date by the Buyers with
respect to any indemnifiable matter pursuant to Sections 9.1(g), 9.1(h) or
9.1(l) within two (2) years after the Closing Date.

 



98 (d) No claim by Mallinckrodt UK for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2(d) shall
be effective unless a Notice of Claim with respect to an indemnifiable matter
thereunder is given by Mallinckrodt UK in accordance herewith within the later
of (i) six (6) months after the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date
or (ii) thirty (30) days after the date on which Mallinckrodt UK first becomes
aware of any indemnifiable matter.

 

(e) A Notice of Claim may be filed after the Closing Date by the Buyers with
respect to any indemnifiable matter pursuant to Sections 9.1(c), 9.1(d),
9.1(f), 9.1(i), 9.1(j), 9.1(k) or 9.1(m) and by either Party with respect to
any breach by the other Party of any of the Perpetual Representations within
fifteen (15) years after the Closing Date.

 

(f) Any Notice of Claim (and any representations and warranties applicable to
such Notice of Claim) filed by either Party hereunder that is timely and
otherwise meets the requirements hereof shall survive until it is fully
determined and (if the Injured Party is entitled to indemnification) until any
amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party have been made.

 

9.7 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) neither Party
shall be entitled to indemnification, pursuant to either Section 9.1(b) or
9.2(b) (as applicable), for any breach of the representations and warranties,
until Losses with respect to all of the foregoing exceed, in the aggregate,
Two Million Eight Hundred Seventy One Thousand Dollars ($2,871,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed, in the
aggregate, the Deductible; _provided, that_ , the foregoing limitation shall
not apply with respect to any Notices of Claim filed for indemnification
pursuant to either Section 9.1(b) or 9.2(b) (as applicable) with respect to
any breach by either Party of any of the Perpetual Representations.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
the liability of Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates for Losses pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b) (except with respect to the Perpetual Representations and the
representations set forth in Section 3.6, for which no such limitation shall
apply), 9.1(f), 9.1(g), 9.1(h) and 9.1(l) exceed Fifty-Seven Million
Four Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($57,420,000) (the " _Cap_ ").

(c) Buyers and their Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification for
Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(b) for any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.6, with respect to any individual claim
unless the Losses associated with such claim exceed Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000) (" _De Minimis Claim_ "). Any De Minimis Claim shall not
count toward calculation of the Deductible.

 

(d) In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any special,
exemplary or similar punitive damages, whether or not a Party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages and whether or not they are
reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances; _provided, that_
notwithstanding the immediately foregoing and subject to any other limitations
set forth herein, an Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for such type of
damages if and to the extent awarded in connection with or as part of any
judgment, order, decree or other final resolution by a court or other tribunal
in connection with a third-party claim for which indemnification is otherwise
available in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



99 (e) All indemnification obligations shall be paid in U.S. Dollars in the
United States.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no liability,
obligation, Contract or other matter shall entitle the Buyers
to indemnification hereunder to the extent that such liability, obligation,
Contract or other matter was adequately taken into account in the calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness or in the Closing Net
Cash.

 

(g) In the case of a transfer pricing adjustment which could result in a
corresponding or correlative adjustment in a Transferred Subsidiary or an
Indirect Subsidiary, Buyers will use commercially reasonable efforts to attain
such corresponding or correlative adjustment to limit the amount of any Loss
before filing a claim for indemnification under the above provisions.

 

(h) For purposes of the indemnification provided pursuant to _Sections 9.1(b)_
and _9.2(b)_ , each of the representations and warranties in this Agreement
that contains any qualifications as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
or any correlative terms (except for the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.4_ and clause (i) of  _Section 3.5_) shall be read,
deemed to have been given, and interpreted as though there were no such
qualifications in determining whether (x) there has been any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any such representations or warranties and (y) the amount of
Losses relating thereto.

9.8 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent
permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.

 

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. The sole and exclusive remedy of any Party for damages
or other monetary relief shall be the rights of indemnification hereunder, as
set forth and as limited in this Article 9; _provided, that_ , notwithstanding
the immediately foregoing, (i) each Party shall retain the right to pursue any
claims in equity that may be available with respect to the nonperformance or
breach of any obligation contemplated to be performed hereunder to the extent
provided in Section 11.14 or to the extent provided under any document,
instrument or certificate to be delivered in connection herewith or under the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) each Party shall further retain the right
to receive relief to redress any fraud or other willful or intentional
wrongdoing related to the transactions contemplated herein, and none of the
provisions set forth in this Article 9 shall apply with respect to any claim
of the type identified in this clause (ii).

ARTICLE 10

Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated
herein abandoned at any time prior to the Closing only as follows:

100 (b) by either the Buyers or the Sellers if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the date that is nine (9) months following the date hereof (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided that_ the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
an additional three (3) months if, within nine (9) months following the
date hereof, all of the conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8 have been
satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to waive such conditions (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each
of which would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date that is nine
(9) months following the date hereof), except for the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(i), Section 7.3 (but only in respect of competitive or antitrust
matters), Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.3 (but only in respect of competitive
or antitrust matters) (collectively, the " _AT Conditions_ "); _provided,
further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this clause (b)
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation or
satisfy any condition (to the extent within such Partys reasonable control)
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date,

(c) by either the Buyers or the Sellers if a court or Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable,

(d) by the Sellers, if any Buyer violates, breaches or fails to comply, as
applicable, in any respect with any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein which would prevent the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligation of the Sellers at the Closing, and such violation,
breach or failure has not been waived by the Sellers and the Buyers are
unable to cure such violation, breach or failure to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Sellers within twenty (20) days after notice thereof from
the Sellers,

 

(e) by the Buyers, if any Seller violates, breaches or fails to comply, as
applicable, in any respect with any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein which would prevent the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligation of the Buyers at the Closing, and such violation,
breach or failure has not been waived by the Buyers and the Sellers are unable
to cure such violation, breach or failure to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Buyers within twenty (20) days after notice thereof from the Buyers; or

 

(f) by the Sellers, if (i) the conditions provided for in Article 7 have been
satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to waive such conditions (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date that notice
of termination is delivered by the Sellers to the Buyers), (ii) the Buyers do
not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the day and
time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2, and (iii) the
Sellers have, at least five (5) Business Days prior to seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f), irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice delivered to the Buyers that the Sellers are ready, willing and
able to consummate the Closing, and the Buyers have not agreed to effect
the Closing by the end of such five (5) Business Day period.

 



101 10.2 _Effect of Termination; Obligations to Cease_.

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
provisions of Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no
further effect, and neither the Buyers nor the Sellers (nor any of their
directors, officers, employees and Affiliates) shall be liable to any person
in respect hereof or of the transactions contemplated hereby except, subject
to the terms of this Section 10.2, (i) for any liability resulting from any
intentional and material breach of any agreement or covenant hereunder or (ii)
for any liability for fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, the obligations contained in Section 6.4 (to the extent provided
therein), the Confidentiality Agreement, and Article 11 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

 

(b) In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 10.1(f) (any such termination, a " _10.1(f) Specified
Termination_ "), the Buyers shall pay the Sellers an amount equal to
$30,000,000 (the " _10.1(f) Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following such termination. In the event of a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 10.1(c) in respect of competitive
or antitrust matters, (y) Section 10.1(b) but, in the case of this clause
(y), only if the three (3) month extension set forth in Section 10.1(b) has
occurred and, as of the end of such period, all of the conditions set forth
in Articles 7 and 8 have been satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to
waive such conditions (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied if the Closing
Date were the date that is twelve (12) months following the date hereof),
except for the AT Conditions or (z) Section 10.1(d) (as a result of a
violation, breach or failure to comply by Buyers of Section 6.6) but, in the
case of this clause (z), only if at the time of any such termination all of
the conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8 have been satisfied or waived by
the Party entitled to waive such conditions (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), except for
the AT Conditions (any such termination, an " _AT Specified Termination_ "
and, together with the 10.1(f) Specified Termination, the " _Specified
Terminations_ "), the Buyers shall pay the Sellers an amount equal to
$5,000,000 (the " _AT Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Sellers as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such
termination. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that without these agreements, the other Party would not enter
into this Agreement. The Sellers may pursue both a grant of specific
performance pursuant to Section 11.14 and the payment of either the 10.1(f)
Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee, provided that the Sellers shall
not be entitled to receive both a grant of such specific performance and
either the 10.1(f) Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee, and the Sellers
shall also not be entitled to receive both the 10.1(f) Termination Fee and
the AT Termination Fee.

(c) In the event that the Buyers shall be obligated to pay either the 10.1(f)
Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee, (i) the actual receipt by the
Sellers of the same shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, which amount
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the breach, Loss or damage that will be
suffered by reason of any such termination of this

 



102  Agreement (and not a penalty) and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Sellers, their Affiliates and any person that is not a Related Party of
the Buyers (as defined below) (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ ")
against the Buyers, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources, any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective former, current or future
equity holders, general or limited partners, members, controlling persons,
managers, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or other representatives
(collectively, the " _Related Parties_ "), (ii) the Releasing Parties shall
not be entitled or permitted to commence or pursue any litigation against the
Buyers, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their former, current or future Related Parties arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iii) none of the Buyers, the
Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources, any of their respective Affiliates or
any of their former, current or future Related Parties shall have any further
liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the
Commitment Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything in this Section 10.2 to the contrary, but subject to Section
10.2(e), the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyers, the Guarantor, the
Debt Financing Sources, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
former, current or future Related Parties, for any monetary damages or other
remedies (including the 10.1(f) Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee, if
payable) in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Equity
Financing) shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the 10.1(f) Termination
Fee or the AT Termination Fee, as applicable in accordance with the terms of
Section 10.2(b), except in the event of a Willful Breach, in which case such
maximum aggregate liability shall not exceed $40,000,000, and in no event
shall any Releasing Party seek or obtain, nor shall it permit any of its
officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or Affiliates or any
other person on its or their behalf to seek or obtain, nor in the event of
the occurrence of any such events shall any person be entitled to seek or
obtain, any monetary recovery or award or any monetary damages of any kind, in
the aggregate, in excess of any such applicable amount against the Buyers,
the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources, any of their respective Affiliates
or any of their former, current or future Related Parties, collectively,
including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with
respect to, this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including any breach by the Buyers or the
Guarantor), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. For
purposes of this Section 10.2(c), " _Willful Breach_ " means an intentional
act or intentional omission by a party that is actually known by such party to
constitute a material breach of this Agreement at the time of such act or
omission.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the rights of any of the Releasing Parties under the Confidentiality
Agreement be limited in any manner or subject to any of the limitations
contained in this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section
10.2 and all rights, obligations and limitations contained herein shall
terminate immediately after the Closing.

 



103 10.3 _Termination of Ancillary Agreements_. The Parties hereto agree that they
will take all actions necessary so that they will not terminate, and none of
their respective Affiliates will terminate, any Ancillary Agreement (if any)
that is executed on the date hereof while this Agreement is still in force,
unless the Parties hereto agree to such termination. The Parties hereto also
agree that they will take all actions necessary to terminate or to cause their
respective Affiliates to terminate each of the Ancillary Agreements (if any)
if this Agreement is terminated.

assignor shall remain fully liable to the other Party in accordance herewith,
regardless of whether or not any assignment to an Affiliate was effected with
the consent of the other Party.

11.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE _LAW_ , ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A

supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written agreement executed by
authorized representatives of all of the Parties hereto. The failure by any

or be deemed a waiver of that Partys rights on any subsequent occasion to
exercise any rights hereunder or to enforce each and every term and condition
hereof.

 



107 11.13 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for in this
Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party hereto will pay its own expenses incident to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
and therein.

 

11.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of such provisions, subject to _Section
10.2_ and pursuant to _Section 11.8_, in addition to injunctive relief to
prevent such non-performance, and following Closing, the remedies permitted by
Article 9 hereof; _provided that_ , prior to the termination of this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Sellers shall only
be entitled to seek specific performance to (a) cause the Buyers to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) cause the Buyers (as a third
party beneficiary of the Buyers rights against the Guarantor under the
Commitment Letter) to draw down the proceeds of the Equity Financing if, and
only if: (i) all conditions in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived
as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur
pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (ii) the Buyers fail to complete the Closing
within two (2) Business Days following the date the Closing would otherwise
be required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (iii) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv) the Sellers have irrevocably
certified to the Buyers in writing that if such specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and in the event of any termination of this Agreement entitling the
Sellers to payment of either the 10.1(f) Termination Fee or the AT Termination
Fee, under no such circumstances will the Sellers (collectively with all of
their Affiliates) be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the 10.1(f)
Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee, as applicable in accordance with
the terms of Section 10.2(b), or be entitled to both (x) a grant of
specific performance or other equitable remedies of the sort described in the
preceding sentence and (y) any monetary damages, including the 10.1(f)
Termination Fee or the AT Termination Fee. The election of the Sellers to
pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit the Sellers from subsequently seeking to terminate this
Agreement and seeking to collect either the 10.1(f) Termination Fee or the AT
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.2(c) in the case of a Specified
Termination; _provided that_ the Sellers receipt of the 10.1(f) Termination
Fee or the AT Termination Fee shall terminate any right to injunctive relief
or specific performance hereunder or other equitable or monetary remedies.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall
be entitled to pursue all remedies without any limitation provided herein
under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

11.15 _Release_. Except for (a) any rights or claims asserted pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any
other documents or instruments delivered hereunder or thereunder and (b) any
claims for which the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim first
occur or arise following the Closing, and (c) any claims in respect of
transactions that occur in the Ordinary Course under any commercial

 



108  arrangements between Mallinckrodt UK or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, either Transferred Subsidiary or any Indirect Subsidiary,
on the other hand, for and in consideration of the delivery of the applicable
amounts in accordance with Section 2.3, effective as of the Closing Date,
Mallinckrodt UK hereby absolutely and unconditionally releases, acquits and
forever discharges, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to absolutely and
unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries, from any and all costs, expenses,
damages, debts, or any other liabilities and claims whatsoever, whether known
or unknown, both in law and in equity, solely arising as a record or
beneficial stockholder or equity owner of a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary before the Closing Date.
