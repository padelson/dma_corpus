destroy all information and documents to the extent they contain any information concerning (as applicable) the Business, the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or other businesses operated by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, as the
case may be (including any copies thereof or extracts therefrom). In the event that any Buyer or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any information or documents that are subject to any non-disclosure obligation set
forth in this Section&nbsp;6.4(a), such Buyer shall provide the Sellers with prompt written notice before such disclosure, if legally permissible, sufficient to enable the Sellers or their Affiliates either to seek a protective order, at their

other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the former shall prevail in all cases.

Indemnifying Party is defending any such third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Injured Party (which shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any third-party claim or consent to the

defense of such third-party claims after the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the defense of such claims on or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such manner is consistent with both Section&nbsp;9.3 above and this Section&nbsp;9.4.
Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section&nbsp;9.4 to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend any action or claim set forth in a Notice of Claim (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Injured Party)

the provisions of Section&nbsp;9.4 and this Section&nbsp;9.5, Section&nbsp;9.5 shall prevail, absent specific written agreement of the Parties to the contrary. If Mallinckrodt UK exercises its right to overall primary management and control of an
Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action, the Buyers shall be kept informed of all significant events occurring and actions taken with respect thereto and the Buyers shall have the right to prior approval with respect to any action
proposed to be taken by Mallinckrodt UK with respect to any such Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action to the extent such action (i)&nbsp;might reasonably interfere in any material way with the business activities of the Buyers or
their Affiliates at any owned or leased site or (ii)&nbsp;might reasonably cause the Buyers or their Affiliates to take any actions that might require significant expenditure of funds or incremental utilization of resources. If the Buyers refuse
unreasonably to consent to any action that Mallinckrodt UK deems reasonably necessary in connection with any Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action, then the dispute mechanism in Section&nbsp;9.5(f) shall apply. The Buyers agree to
grant reasonable access to Mallinckrodt UK and its Affiliates (and its and their representatives) to the Buyers&#146; and their Affiliates&#146; facilities during normal working hours to allow Mallinckrodt UK to discharge its obligations under this
