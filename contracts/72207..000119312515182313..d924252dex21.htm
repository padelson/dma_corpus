Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in respect of
Book-Entry Shares) as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Company Common Shares will be entitled to
receive (x) New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of New Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article III_ (after taking into account all Company Common Shares then
surrendered by such holder) and (y) a check in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article III_ , including cash payable in lieu of any fractional New
Common Shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ and distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Shares, or
any Parent distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such Company Common Shares may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Shares or evidence of ownership
of the Book-Entry Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent and, in the case
of either certificated or book-entry Company Common Shares, accompanied by
all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer, and
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the record holder of such Company
Common Shares, or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until all such required
documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Company Common Shares upon such delivery and surrender, and
any cash or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Sections 3.3(c)_ and  _3.3(d)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Common Shares_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Company
Common Shares with respect to New Common Shares that such holder would be
entitled to receive in accordance herewith and 

 



19  no cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Shares will be paid to any
such holder until such holder has delivered the required documentation and
surrendered any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the
requirements of _Section 3.3(b)_, there will be paid to such holder of New
Common Shares, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of fractional New Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(d)_ (which shall be promptly paid by the Exchange Agent) and the
amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such New Common Shares, and (ii) the amount
of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance
payable with respect to such New Common Shares (which shall be paid by
Parent).

(d) _Fractional New Common Shares_.

 

(i) No fractional New Common Shares shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each former holder of a Company Common Share otherwise entitled to a
fractional New Common Share (after aggregating all fractional New Common
Shares issuable to such holder) will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 3.3(d)_, a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional New Common Shares representing such
holders proportionate interest, if any (as determined below in _Section
3.3(d)(ii))_, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by
any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more
transactions of New Common Shares equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate
number of New Common Shares to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ over (B) the aggregate number of whole New
Common Shares to be distributed to the holders of Company Common Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional New Common Shares was not separately bargained-for consideration
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional New Common Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of
Company Common Shares that would otherwise receive fractional New Common
Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the NYSE
in the manner provided in _Section 3.3(d)(ii)_.

 

(ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Company Common Shares that would otherwise receive fractional New
Common Shares, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of Company Common Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust
for the holders of Company Common Shares that would otherwise receive
fractional shares of New Common Shares (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which
each former holder of Company Common Shares shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying (A) the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common
Shares Trust by (B) a fraction, (x) the numerator of

 



20  which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former
holder of Company Common Shares would otherwise be entitled and (y) the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Company Common Shares would otherwise be entitled.

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Shares in lieu of any
fractional New Common Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of shares of New Common Shares without interest,
subject to and in accordance with _Section 3.3_.

(e) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a Company Common Share in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_) will be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Share.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares after 180 days
following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent
and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Company Common Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will thereafter
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Company Common Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common Shares to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, or any distributions
with respect to New Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent. Without limitation of the foregoing, after 180
days following the Effective Time, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of Company Common Shares will become the property of Parent, subject to the
legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled thereto under abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent, or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of Company Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Company Common Shares represented by such
Certificate and any amounts to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Sections 3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_.

(h) _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company

 



21  Common Shares, Company Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company PSUs
such amounts or securities as Parent or the Exchange Agent reasonably deems to
be required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment or
issuance. To the extent that amounts or securities are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid or issued to the holder of Company Common Shares, Company
Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company PSUs in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

(i) _Book Entry Shares_. All New Common Shares to be issued in the Merger will
be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis,
in Parents sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment
or loss thereon affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts
payable to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Company PSUs, as applicable, pursuant to the other
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.5_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments will be paid promptly to Parent.

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger_. The Company and Parent each acknowledge
and agree that for federal income Tax purposes the Integrated Mergers will be
treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to prepare and file all U.S.
federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing and shall not
take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to U.S.
federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Taxing Authority.

 

3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Without limiting the covenants in _Sections
4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Company Common Shares or Parent
Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class after the date hereof by reason of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of
Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares, the Exchange Ratio will be
correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Shares,
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company PSUs, as applicable,
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.4_ shall be
deemed to permit or authorize any Party hereto to affect any such change that
it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this
Agreement.

3.5 _Treatment of Company Options; Company Restricted Shares and Company
PSUs_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions to
adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Options to provide that each
Company Option that is outstanding

 



22  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
converted into an option to purchase (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ "), on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of Parent Common Shares,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number
of Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option by the Exchange Ratio,
at an exercise price per Parent Common Share, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, equal to the per share exercise price for the Company Common Shares
otherwise purchasable pursuant to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions to
adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares to provide that,
as of the Effective Time, the Company Restricted Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a number of
restricted Parent Common Shares (" _Adjusted Restricted Shares_ ") subject to
the same vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions equal to the number
of corresponding Company Restricted Shares multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole share.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions to
adjust the terms of all outstanding Company PSUs to provide that, as of the
Effective Time, the Company PSUs that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, in accordance with the terms thereof, be deemed
earned at the target level of 100% and shall be converted into restricted
Parent Common Shares (" _Converted PSU Shares_ ") that will vest on the last
day of the original performance period as provided under the terms of the
applicable Company PSU award agreement. The number of Converted PSU Shares
that will be received by each holder of outstanding Company PSUs shall be
equal to the target number of Company Common Shares subject to the applicable
award of Company PSUs multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all Adjusted Options,
Adjusted Restricted Shares and Converted PSU Shares that are held by any
employee, director or consultant whose employment or service with the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries is terminated
by the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
without "Cause" (as such term is defined in the applicable Company Stock
Plan, award agreement or other Company Employee Benefit Plan) or who resigns
his or her employment or service for "Good Reason" (as such term is defined in
the applicable Company Stock Plan, award agreement or other Company Employee
Benefit Plan), shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall
lapse and Adjusted Options shall become and remain exercisable pursuant to
(and for the time periods set forth under) the terms thereof, in accordance
with the applicable Company Stock Plan, award agreement or other Company
Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) assume all of the obligations
of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with respect to the outstanding
Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares and Converted PSU Shares, and
(ii) file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-3 or Form
S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to all Parent
Common Shares underlying Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares and
Converted PSU Shares.

reasonable

 



34  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees
or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit committee of the Company
Board or to the Company Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such
reporting. The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications were complete and accurate as of the dates they were
made.

and exoneration provisions contained in any such Company Material Agreement
may be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the Company
Material Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto (ii) is in full force and effect, and
(iii) other than with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement, immediately

(d) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent it is a party
thereto or bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other
party thereto has performed in all material respects all obligations required
to be performed by it under each Company Material Agreement. There is not, to
the Knowledge of the Company, under any Company Material Agreement, any
default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice
of termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case, except

requisite waivers or consents have been obtained or which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

since January 1, 2013, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company

Statements, and except for any such matter that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect:

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets, real
properties and operations are in compliance with all Environmental Laws and
Environmental Permits;

(b) Since January 1, 2009, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice from any Governmental Authority alleging, with
respect to any such entity or any of their respective assets, real properties
or operations, the violation of or liability under any Environmental Law
(including liability as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any
analogous state laws) or any Environmental Permit that remains unresolved;

(c) There are no actions, suits, proceedings (including civil, administrative
and dispute resolution proceedings), claims, government investigations,
orders, decrees or judgments pending or in effect, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by a Governmental Authority against the Company which
allege a violation of or liability under any Environmental Law ("
_Environmental Claim_ ");

 

(d) Since January 1, 2014, there has been no Release of any Hazardous Material
by the Company or its Subsidiaries at, on, under or from any real properties
as a result of the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries that has not
been remediated as required by any Environmental Law or otherwise adequately
reserved for in the Company Financial Statements;

 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no actions, activities,
circumstances, facts, conditions, events or incidents, including the presence
of any Hazardous Material, which would be reasonably likely to form the basis
of any Environmental Claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or to
the Knowledge of the Company, against any Person whose liability for
such Environmental Claims the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or may
have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of Law; and

 

(f) The representations and warranties in _Sections 5.11_ (Compliance) and
_5.16_ (Litigation) shall not apply to matters relating to Environmental
Permits, Hazardous Materials and Environmental Law.

5.14 _Reserve Report_. The Company has made available to Parent complete
copies of all written reports prepared by any Person that is not an Affiliate
of the Company and delivered to or received by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on or before the date of this Agreement estimating the Companys and its
Subsidiaries Hydrocarbon reserves with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties.
The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the Oil and Gas Properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the reserve report audited by
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. referred to in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the "
_Company Reserve Report_ ") was based was accurate at the time such data was
provided to Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., except for any inaccuracy
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material 

 



41  Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no material
errors in the assumptions and estimates provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve
Report. The Hydrocarbon reserve estimates of the Company and its Subsidiaries
set forth in the Company Reserve Report fairly reflect, in all material
respects, the Hydrocarbon reserves of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with the rules promulgated
by the SEC and applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods reflected
therein. Except for changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity
prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Company Reserve Report that would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The estimates
of proved Hydrocarbon reserves provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. in connection with the preparation of
the Company Reserve Reports complied in all material respects with Rule 4-10
of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.

5.15 _Title to Properties_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all
real and personal properties which are material to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including all of the Oil and Gas Properties
reflected in the Company Reserve Report (excluding any Oil and Gas Properties
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 2014 under any Company
Material Agreement disclosed on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure
Letter), in each case free and clear of all Liens and defects and
imperfections of title except (i) such as do not materially affect the value
of such property and do not materially interfere with the use made and
proposed to be made of such property by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
for Permitted Encumbrances and (iii) such as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means
title that is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person
engaged in the business of purchasing and owning, developing, and operating
producing or non-producing Oil and Gas Properties in the geographical areas in
which they are located, with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal
bearing, would be willing to accept, acting reasonably.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of
each agreement described in Section 5.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
including all amendments thereto (the " _Specified Agreements_ "). Except to
the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity, each material Oil and Gas Lease and each Specified Agreement (i)
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and
effect, and (iii) immediately after the Effective Time will continue
to constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties
thereto in accordance with its terms. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of the other parties
thereto, has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act
which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default under the 

 



42  provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease or any Specified Agreement. Except as
set forth in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge
of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any notice of any material violation or breach of, material default under or
intention to cancel, terminate, modify or not renew any material Oil and Gas
Lease or any Specified Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title, in all
material respects, to each material real property (and each material real
property at which its operations are conducted) owned by it (in each case
excluding Oil and Gas Leases and Company Real Property Leases, the " _Company
Owned Real Property_ ") except for Permitted Encumbrances. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has a good and valid leasehold interest in each
lease, sublease and other agreement under which it uses or occupies or has the
right to use or occupy any material real property (or material real property
at which its operations are conducted) (but excluding Oil and Gas Leases)
(such property subject to a lease, sublease or other agreement, the " _Company
Leased Real Property_ " and such leases, subleases and other agreements
are, collectively, the " _Company Real Property Leases_ "), in each case,
free and clear of all Liens other than any Permitted Encumbrances. Each
Company Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. No uncured
default of a material nature on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the landlord thereunder,
exists under any Company Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without the giving of notice, the passage
of time, or both, would constitute a material breach or default under a
Company Real Property Lease. Section 5.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth an accurate and complete list of the Company Owned Real Property
and the Company Leased Real Property (collectively, the " _Company Real
Property_ ").

(d) There are no leases, subleases, licenses, rights or other agreements
burdening or affecting any portion of the Company Real Property that would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use of such
Company Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the operation of
their respective businesses thereon. Except for such arrangements solely
between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries, there are no outstanding
options or rights of first refusal in favor of any other party to purchase
any Company Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein
that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing
use of the Company Owned Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the operation of their respective businesses thereon. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently subleasing, licensing or otherwise
granting any person the right to use or occupy a material portion of a Company
Real Property that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the existing use of such Company Real Property by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective businesses thereon. The
Company Real Property constitutes all of the material real estate used in the
operation of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
appropriation, condemnation or like Proceeding or order by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person materially affecting any material Company Owned
Real Property or any part 

 



43  thereof or of any sale or other disposition of any material Company Owned
Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation or other matters
materially affecting and impairing the current use, occupancy or value
thereof.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 5.15(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
all material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and
Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being received by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a timely manner and are not being held in
suspense for any reason.

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 5.15(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the Knowledge of the Company, all of the Hydrocarbon Wells and all water,
CO2 or injection Wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases or of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or otherwise associated with an Oil and Gas Property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been drilled, completed and operated,
as applicable, within the limits permitted by the applicable contracts and
applicable Law, in all material respects, and all drilling and completion (and
plugging and abandonment) of the Hydrocarbon Wells and such other Wells and
all related development, production and other operations have been conducted
in compliance with all applicable Law in all material respects.

 

(h) All Oil and Gas Properties operated by the Company and or any of its
Subsidiaries have been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil
and gas field practices and in material compliance with the applicable Oil and
Gas Leases and in material compliance with applicable Company Material
Agreements, material joint operating agreements, and applicable Law.

 

(i) None of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any preferential purchase, consent, transfer fee,
termination fee, capital recovery fee, payout or similar right or obligation
that would become operative or be required by the Company or any of its
Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(j) None of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any Tax partnership agreement or provisions
requiring a partnership income Tax Return to be filed under Subchapter K of
Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code.

 

(k) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title to, or in the case of leased property and assets, has valid
leasehold interests in or valid rights under contract to use, all tangible
personal property reflected on the Company balance sheet or acquired after the
Balance Sheet Date, except for tangible personal property sold since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business, and none of such
property or assets is subject to any Lien, except Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(l) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the
Company, all Production Burdens under any Company Material Agreement or
Specified Agreement have been

 



44  properly and timely paid (or which constitute suspense funds) and all
expenses payable under the terms of the agreements and contracts have been
properly and timely paid except for such expenses as are being currently paid
prior to delinquency in the ordinary course of business.

(m) Except as set forth in Section 5.15(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
as of the date of this Agreement, there is no outstanding authorization for
expenditure or similar request or invoice for funding or participation under
any agreement or contract which are binding on the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any Oil and Gas Properties and which the Company reasonably anticipates
will individually require expenditures by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
excess of $10,000,000.

 

5.16 _Litigation_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
except with respect to environmental matters (which are provided for in
_Section 5.13_), there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, litigation, claims, causes of action, investigations, arbitrations,
mediations or other proceedings (collectively, " _Proceedings_ ") pending or,

Subsidiaries or any of their assets or property or to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or property is otherwise a party
or subject or, to the Knowledge of the Company, a threatened party, except for
Proceedings that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger.

(b) There is no judgment, settlement, order, decision, direction,
writ, injunction, decree, stipulation or legal or arbitration award of, or
promulgated or issued by, any Governmental Authority in effect to which any of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject which materially
interferes with, or would be reasonably expected to materially interfere
with, the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.

 

5.17 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied (or to be
supplied) by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion in (a)
the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it

material Taxes owed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown

all respects in accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of all Laws applicable to such Company Employee Benefit
Plan, and complies with such terms and such Laws, in each case except where
the failure to be so administered or to so comply, would not, individually or

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event (where such other event by
itself would not result in such consequence), (i) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any current
or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (whether by virtue of any termination, severance, change of

consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement by or for the benefit of any individual who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)

engagement of independent contractors, including all such applicable Law
relating to wages, hours, overtime, collective bargaining, discrimination,
classification of employees and independent contractors, civil rights, safety
and health and workers compensation, except where the failure to comply
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

labor agreement, collective bargaining agreement, work rules or practices, or
any other labor-related agreements or arrangements with any labor union or
labor organization; there are no labor agreements, collective bargaining

officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (x) all

controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or

Parent policy contemplating such reporting. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all

related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were

administered in all respects in accordance with its terms, and in compliance
with the applicable provisions of all Laws applicable to such Parent Employee
Benefit Plan, and complies with such terms and such Laws, in each case except

Plans) or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened

approvals or waivers from Third Parties, and (v)

 



58  execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) be required to pay any penalty, compensation or other
consideration to any Third Party for any consent or approval required under
any license, contract or agreement for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust
Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other
applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
_Section 7.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay any HSR Act filing
fee.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other Party
of (and supply to the Other Party) any communication received by such Party
from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger, (iii) permit the
Other Party to review in advance and incorporate the Other Partys reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the
Other Party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any
other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the Other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to  _Section
7.4(b)_, the Parties will take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this 
_Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Party is required to disclose to the Other Party its documents responsive to
Items 4(c) and 4(d) of the HSR Notification and Report Form.

(d) In furtherance of the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.1_
and subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 7.1(d)_, if any
objections are asserted with respect to the

 



59  Merger under any Antitrust Law or if any lawsuit or other proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Authority challenging the Merger or which would otherwise
prohibit or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger, each of
Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to) take all actions necessary to resolve any such objections or lawsuits or
other proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or other proceedings) so as to
permit consummation of the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable,
including becoming subject to, consenting to or agreeing to, or otherwise
taking any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its respective assets
or business (including that of its Affiliates) (each, a " _Divestiture Action_
"); _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any such action that would reasonably be expected to
impair the benefits of the Merger to Parent or to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and _provided further_ ,
that the obligations of the parties under this _Section 7.1(d)_ to consummate
any such Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Closing in a case
where the Closing will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 7.1_ (but subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 7.1(d)_), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, each
of Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

 

7.2 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent will prepare and the Company will file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and the Company and Parent will prepare and Parent will file with
the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. The Parties shall file, if necessary, any other
statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by
the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement and any such
statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the

 



60  Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or dissemination to the Company Stockholders of,
the Proxy Statement or any other materials used in connection with the
Company Meeting that constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials"
as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act
or are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are
defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act (" _Other Proxy Materials_ ")
will be made by the Company without providing the Other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by
Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such comments). If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify
the Other Party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Parties will
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
or for additional information and each Party will supply the Other Party with
copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to
the Registration Statement; _provided_ that no responses to any oral or
written request by the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement or the Other Proxy Materials, will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without providing the Other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by
Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such comments).

__(b) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective by
the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Company Meeting.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
by the Company Stockholders and an advisory vote on compensation payable to
executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger (together with
related procedural matters) shall be the only proposals to be submitted to,
or voted on by, the Company Stockholders at the Company Meeting. Subject to
_Section 7.3_, the Company will, through the Company Board, recommend to the
Company Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to _Section 7.3_)
include the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), other than (i) to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) in
the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company Board has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders prior
to the __

 



61 _ _ Company Meeting, and (iv) if the Company has delivered any notice
contemplated by _Section 7.3(d)_ or _Section 7.3(e)_ and the time periods
contemplated by  _Section 7.3(d)_ or _Section 7.3(e)_ have not expired to
extend the date of the Company Meeting beyond the end of such period. __

 

7.3 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any possible Alternative Proposal, and request that each Person who
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
such Persons consideration of any Alternative Proposal return or destroy all
confidential information previously provided to such Person by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_,
the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries or the making or the submission of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that
has made an Alternative Proposal or to any Person in contemplation of an
Alternative Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this _Section 7.3_ and to limit its
conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral), (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend) any Alternative Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
term sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, exchange agreement or any other agreement providing for with
respect to an Alternative Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (v) amend or grant any waiver, release or
modification under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement
with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (vi) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.3_, if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a
written Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith is
_bona fide_ , (ii) the Company Board, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
or result in a Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions
or to furnish such information or data to such Third Party would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company may, subject to clauses (w)-(z) below, (A) furnish
information, including confidential information, with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ that (w) such Alternative Proposal was received after the
date of this Agreement, such Alternative Proposal was not initiated,
solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of this  _Section 7.3(a)_
and such Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn, (x) the Company provides
to Parent the notice required by _Section 7.3(b)_ with respect to such
Alternative Proposal, (y) the Company will 

 



62  not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers and employees not to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective other Representatives not to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person unless the Company has, or first enters into, a
confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions
that are not materially less restrictive to such Person than the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, a copy of which shall be
promptly provided to Parent (it being agreed that such confidentiality
agreement between the Company and such person shall permit such person to make
any non-public Alternative Proposal to the Company Board) and (z) prior to or
substantially concurrently with providing or making available to such other
Person any non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries that
was not previously provided or made available to Parent, the Company will
provide such non-public information to Parent.

If Parent or the Company believes that there has been a breach by a Third
Party (or its Representatives) of any standstill provisions to which such
Third Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or Parent
or the Company reasonably anticipates such a breach, then upon written
request by Parent, the Company shall take all necessary actions to enforce
such standstill provision.

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this _Section
7.3_, the Company will promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) of any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal or non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with an Alternative Proposal advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request (including providing the identity of
the person making or submitting such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request
and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or
request and any related draft agreements and (y) if oral, a reasonably
detailed summary thereof) (and any changes thereto). The Company will keep
Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to any such
Alternative Proposal (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
following any such development).

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof will directly or indirectly: (i) withhold,
withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, in any manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, including by failing to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, (ii)
publicly approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with
respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve any
transaction under, or any Third Party becoming, an "interested stockholder"
under, Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar concepts under any other applicable
Takeover Law), or (v) resolve, propose, agree or publicly announce an
intention to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this _Section
7.3(c)_ being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, a public statement that merely describes the Companys
receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto shall not be deemed a Change in Recommendation.

 



63 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith is _bona
fide_ and such Alternative Proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged
or facilitated in violation of this _Section 7.3(a)_ and the Company Board
(i) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(ii) following consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the
failure of the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(h)_ (provided, however,
that such termination shall not be effective unless and until the Company
shall have paid the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.4(c)_)
and/or effect a Change in Recommendation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may not take such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice (which notice must state
that the Company Board has made the determinations contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 7.3(d)_) to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group
making such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of the proposed
definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for such Superior
Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant proposed
transaction agreements) at least four (4) calendar days in advance of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Change in Recommendation (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(d)_ and a
new Notice Period, except that such new Notice Period in connection with any
amendment shall be for three (3) calendar days from the time Parent receives
such notice (as opposed to four (4) calendar days)); 

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board again concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that such
Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the
failure of the Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation with respect
to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(e) Other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 7.3(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
7.3(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board from making a Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event to the extent that (i) the Company Board 

 



64  determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent four (4) calendar
days written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior to
making such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent during such four (4) calendar day period (to the extent that
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would not permit the Company Board to make a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_, and (C) the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered
in writing by Parent, and following such four (4) calendar day period, shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law would continue to require a Change in Recommendation
with respect to such Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Company Stockholders; _
provided_, _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board with respect to this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board in connection
with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect
to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of
the Company Board. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company or
the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company Stockholders) will not be considered a failure to make, or a
withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or
a portion of the Company Board Recommendation.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A)
direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to
20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
to which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
of 20% or more of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Shares, or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company which is

 



65  structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of
at least 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
at least 20% of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence that is not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if
known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences
of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) to or by the Company Board
as of the date of this Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence becomes known to or by the Company Board prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written offer, obtained after the date
of this Agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Shares or more than 50% of the consolidated assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, made by a Third Party, which is on terms
and conditions which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be more
favorable to the Company Stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at
the time of determination all financial, legal and regulatory terms and
conditions of the Alternative Proposal and this Agreement, including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed
to by Parent in writing in response to such Superior Proposal, including any
conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-
consummation, of such Alternative Proposal.

 

7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the Other Party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to (and, with respect to books and
records, the right to copy) all of its and its Subsidiaries properties
(including for purposes of environmental assessment; _provided, however_ ,
that no subsurface or other invasive testing or sampling of any property of
any of the Company may be conducted without the Companys prior written
approval), commitments, books, contracts, records and correspondence (in each
case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Without
limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
Company shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, and provide Parent and its
Representatives continued access to, the Data Site, and shall not remove any
documents or information loaded onto the Data Site prior to, on or after the
date hereof. The Company shall not remove any of the documents or
items provided in the Data Site through and including the Closing Date. Each
Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, properties and personnel as
the other party may reasonably request (including information necessary to
prepare the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement).

 



66  Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, each Party and its Representatives shall hold information received
from the Other Party pursuant to this  _Section 7.4_ in confidence in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall not require either Party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
(i) would reasonably be expected to result in any violation of any contract
or Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or
cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with
respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could in
such Partys good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may
be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys
position in any pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) is reasonably pertinent to any litigation, if any, in
which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties;
provided that, in the case of clause (i), the Parties hereto shall cooperate
in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including
by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so
(A) would not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to
disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-
house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such
contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-
employee Representatives of the Other Party shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further, that the Party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the Other Party that such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the Other Party in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such information
(to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in
this _Section 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable Third Party to any such contract with respect to the disclosures
prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the
terms of such contract).

7.5 _Public Statements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will
not, and each will cause its respective Representatives not to, issue any
public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written
approval of the Other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys
equity securities are traded, _provided_ that such Party uses reasonable best
efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity to first review the content
of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 7.5_ to consult with Parent or any other Person with respect to a
public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a Change in
Recommendation.

 



67 7.6 _Confidentiality_. The obligations of Parent and the Company under
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and all
information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as
defined under the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
performance by the Company or Parent of their respective obligations under
this Agreement and, in the case of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

 

7.7 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Company nor Parent will take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all
reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

7.8 _New Common Shares Listed_. Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on the NYSE, upon official
notice of issuance, the New Common Shares.

 

7.9 _Non-Competition Agreements_. Subject to Section 7.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, prior to the Closing, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a non-competition agreement with each of the
individuals identified in Section 7.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_Listed Employees_ ") in a form and on such terms and conditions as will be
agreed between the Listed Employees and the Company.

7.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, the
Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who
is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, (A) an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, together
with such Persons heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by applicable Law from and against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) 

 



68  arising out of or in connection with any Claim or Action; and (ii) promptly
pay on behalf of or, within fifteen (15) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without
the requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if required by applicable Law, it shall be a condition to the payment or
advancement of any Indemnification Expenses that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such
Indemnification Expenses paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law.
The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time in the capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Claim or Action
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any
Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof (with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to such cessation) and inure to the benefit of such
Indemnified Partys heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
As used in this _Section 7.10_: (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any other person,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ ")
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a director or officer of the Company or of any of
its Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any
compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term " _Indemnification
Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs,
expenses and obligations (including reasonable experts fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as reasonable telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification
is sought pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_, including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified
Party; and (z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any provision of the DGCL that authorizes or
permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the
corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL: and
(2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors, officers,
trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity
in which any Indemnified Party serves. To the extent permitted by Law, any
amendment, alteration or repeal of the DGCL that adversely affects any

 



69  right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does not limit
or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any
occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took
place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect of which indemnification
has been or would reasonably be expected to be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement effected without either Parents or the Surviving
Corporations prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate. In the event
of any such Action, each applicable Indemnified Party, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Company Charter
and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements
(including, without limitation, the Director and Officer Indemnification
Agreements) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the
organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries will contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are
set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions will not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of (6) six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then only
to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided, however_ , that any such
modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior
to modification; and _provided further_ that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any Claim made within such period
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such Claim.

 



70 (d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the current directors and
officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the
Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on
or before the Effective Time, but neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date hereof and will purchase
the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the
coverage described in this _Section 7.10(d)_ would cost in excess of that
amount.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or
other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.10_.

(g) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on the Surviving Corporation and
its successors and assigns.

7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, to the extent
in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such Party or its Subsidiaries from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or to materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries and that relate to the Merger, (c) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable, contained
herein at any time during the term hereof, (d) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ and (e)
any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in
the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VIII_ ; _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (c), (d) and (e), the
failure to comply with this _Section 7.11_ shall not result in the failure
to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ , or
give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article IX_ , if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

 



71 7.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to the Surviving Corporation, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2015, Parent will, or will
cause its Affiliates to, provide each Employee who remains in the active
employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates (the " _Continuing Employees_
") with (i) a base salary or wages that are no less than such Continuing
Employees base salary or wages as of the Effective Time, (ii) bonus, equity
and long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than those provided to such Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time. From January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2016, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, provide
the Continuing Employees with compensation and employee benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.13(a)_ above, from the
Effective Time through the second anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, provide each Continuing Employee with
severance benefits that are no less favorable in all respects (including
eligibility and level of benefits) than (i) the Companys Executive Change in
Control Plan for employees designated as eligible to participate therein as of
the date hereof, and (ii) for other employees, those provided under the
Companys Employee Change in Control Plan.

 

(c) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, honor, in accordance with
its terms, each Company Employee Benefit Plan listed on  _Section 5.19(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and all obligations thereunder including any
rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event,
including termination of employment), and Parent hereby agrees and
acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control" or
similar term, as the case may be, for all purposes under each Company
Employee Benefit Plan.

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, cause each material Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including all
applicable vacation, severance and defined contribution retirement benefit
plans and programs) in which any 

 



72  Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior
service of such Continuing Employee with any of the Company and its Affiliates
as service rendered to Parent for all purposes (including vesting,
eligibility, level of benefit and benefit accrual purposes, but other than for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under
any equity compensation plan) to the extent that such service crediting does
not violate any applicable Law or result in duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.

(e) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of any
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements, and
requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and
welfare plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent to the extent such
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a
health and welfare benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as
the case may be), and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied
or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
credit each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such employee and
covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan of the Company or
any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) prior to the Effective Time during
the year in which the Effective Time occurs for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such employee and his or her dependents have satisfied
their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum
under any medical plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent for such year.

(f) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days
accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time to the extent reflected on the Companys books and records.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 7.13_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 7.13_ amends, or will be deemed to amend
(or prevent the amendment or termination of), any Company Employee Benefit
Plan or Parent Employee Benefit Plan. Parent and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any Continuing
Employee for any period of time following the Effective Time and Parent and
its Affiliates will be entitled to modify any compensation or benefits
provided to, and any other terms or conditions of employment of, any such
employees in its absolute discretion.

7.14 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).
None of the

 



73  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
shall take or cause to be taken any action that prevents or impedes, or could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Integrated Mergers from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

(b) The Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts
in order for the Company and Parent to obtain the tax opinions referenced in
_Section 8.2(d)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_.

 

(c) Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to
interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, if applicable
with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Company.

 

7.15 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any security holder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

7.16 _Governance Matters_. Parent shall take all necessary corporate action
to appoint to Parents Board of Directors, as of the Effective Time, one
member of the Companys Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement
that is mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company.

 

7.17 _Target Debt and Termination of Mortgages_.

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, concurrently
with the Effective Time (or before), (i) obtain customary payoff letters to
terminate the Existing Credit Agreement, (ii) coordinate with Parent and hedge
providers to make arrangements with respect to Derivative Transactions and
(iii) make arrangements satisfactory to Parent for the release of all Liens
arising from or granted in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement.

(b) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
the event that Parent desires to consummate an exchange offer, tender offer,
repurchase offer, consent solicitation, discharge, defeasance, redemption or
similar transaction, or any combination thereof (collectively, the " _Debt
Transactions_ "), with respect to the Companys 5.625% Senior Notes due 2021,
5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 (collectively,
the " _Notes_ "), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives (and, in the case of the Company, the trustee
for the Notes) to, cooperate with one another in good faith to permit such
Debt Transactions to be effected on such terms, conditions and timing as
reasonably requested by Parent, including if so requested by Parent, causing
those Debt Transactions to be consummated substantially concurrently with, but
not prior to, the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of
any Debt Transaction shall not be a condition to Closing.

(c) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any documented reasonable
out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection
with any Debt Transactions. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, partners, members,
directors and affiliates, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any dealer-manager,
information agent, solicitation agent, depositary or other agent or Person
engaged by or on behalf of Parent or the Company (and such Persons officers,
employees, partners, members, directors and affiliates and each other Person,
if any, who controls such Person within the meaning of Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) at the request of Parent in connection with any Debt
Transactions if applicable, for and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with any Debt Transactions.

obtained (except as otherwise provided below) as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by the Company or Parent if there is in effect a final nonappealable order
of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Company, on the one hand, or

the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(c) by Parent if (i) the Company has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company becomes
untrue, and, with respect to either (i) or (ii) above, the conditions set
forth in _Sections 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach,

become true) within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company
of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from Parent;

(d) by the Company if (i) Parent has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

and, with respect to either (i) or (ii) above, 

 



77  the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be
satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or untruth is incapable of being
cured (or becoming true) or, if capable of being cured (or becoming true), is
not cured (or has not become true) within thirty (30) days following receipt
by Parent of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from the Company;

 

(e) by the Company or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before
November 12, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ ");  _ provided_, that such failure
of the Closing to occur is not due to the failure of such Party to perform and
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be
performed or complied with by such Party prior to the Closing;

(f) by the Company or Parent if the Company Meeting has concluded and the
Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained; 

(g) by Parent, if a Change in Recommendation has occurred; or

 

(h) by the Company, if the Company is terminating this Agreement to enter into
a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance with
_Section 7.3_, provided that the Company has complied with _Section 9.4(c)_,

9.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the Other Party, and this
Agreement will terminate without further action by Parent or the Company.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided in _Section 9.1_, then each of the Parties will be
relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination will be without liability to
Parent or the Company;  _provided_ , that the agreements and obligations of
the Parties set forth in this _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_ and _Article X_
hereof will survive any such termination and are enforceable hereunder;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.3_ shall relieve
any of Parent or the Company of any liability for fraud or any Willful Breach
of any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring prior to termination,
or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved
Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in
equity. " _Willful Breach_ " means an intentional and willful material breach,
or an intentional and willful material failure to perform, in each case that
is the consequence of an act or omission by a Party with the knowledge that
the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn at the time of, the
date of the Company Meeting (or, if the Company Meeting has not occurred,
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or
_Section 9.1(e)_) and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 9.1(e)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_
and (iii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, an Alternative Proposal within twelve (12) months after the date
this Agreement is terminated, then the

 



78  Company will pay to Parent the Termination Fee, upon the earlier of (x) the
date of the execution of such definitive agreement by the Company (or, if such
date is not a Business Day, then the first Business Day following such date)
and (y) the consummation of any such transaction. For purposes of this
_Section 9.4(a)_, the term " _Alternative Proposal_ " has the meaning
assigned to such term in  _Section 7.3(g)(i)_, except that the references to
"20% or more" are deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_, then the Company will pay to Parent, within two (2) Business Days
after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(h)_, then the Company will pay to Parent, immediately prior to
or simultaneously with such termination, the Termination Fee.

 

(d) Any payment of the Termination Fee (or applicable portion thereof) will be
made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent.

(e) Each Party will pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering
into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that Parent will pay 100% of the filing fees
payable in connection with the filings required to be made under the HSR Act.

 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 9.4_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this _Section 9.4_, the Company shall pay to Parent and
Merger Sub (as the case may be) its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal
relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
_Section 9.4_ at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. The Parties agree that in the event
that the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the Company has no
further liability to Parent of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall
release any party from liability for Willful Breach or fraud), and that in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 

(g) As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to sixty-
five million dollars ($65,000,000).

waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties
hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the Parties, on one or more occasions, to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or

are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or
remedies that any Party may otherwise have at Law or in equity.

10.6 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,

and understanding

 



81  of the Parties with respect to the matters therein and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings on such matters. The provisions of this

10.7 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.8 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The Parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States sitting in
the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or federal
court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that any and all
claims arising under or with respect to this Agreement may be heard and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent permitted by law, in a federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any Delaware state or federal court located in the State of Delaware and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any
such court.

10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS
_SECTION 10.9_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH
PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



82 10.10 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other
representative of any Party hereto has any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the Parties to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 10.11_ in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent permitted by law, in a federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) either party
has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further
agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_, and each Party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

10.12 _Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, none of the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the parties in _Sections 3.3_ ,
_3.4_ , _3.5_ , _7.10_ , _7.13_ , _7.14_ and this _Article X_ will survive the
Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the
agreements of the parties in _Sections 7.6_ , _7.17(c)_ , _9.2_ , _9.3_ and
_9.4_ , and this _Article X_ will survive such termination. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time.
