sale of the assets of the Company by SAVVIS to the Buyer for all federal,
state and local income Tax purposes, as well as state and local income Tax

parties on their respective federal income Tax Returns as required by Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and each
party shall provide the other party with a copy of such statement or form as
filed and any subsequently filed amendment thereto. The Buyer and SAVVIS agree

litigation or otherwise) of such assets realized or received by the Sellers or

SECTION 3. _ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE_.

SECTION 3.1. _Net Working Capital_. _Schedule 3.1_ sets forth a calculation of
the current assets, less the current liabilities, in each case solely
relating to the Business, as of October 31, 2006. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Net Working Capital" means, as of any date, the current assets
solely relating to the Business (other than Excluded Current Assets) less the
current liabilities solely relating to the Business (other than Excluded
Current Liabilities). The Net Working Capital, as of any specified date, shall
be calculated using the same accounting principles, procedures, policies and
methods employed in preparing the October Working Capital Report.

SECTION 3.2. _Closing Determination_. Not more than seven (7) Business Days
nor less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, SAVVIS shall,
in good faith using then available financial information for the Business,
prepare and deliver to the Buyer a separate report (the " _Estimated Working
Capital Report_ ") setting forth an estimate of the Net Working Capital as of
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital_
"). The Estimated Working Capital Report shall be prepared in good faith
using the then-available financial information for the Business and shall be
prepared in the same manner as the October Working Capital Report and
following the accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods
employed in preparing the October Working Capital Report. If (i) the Estimated
Adjusted Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, the Purchase
Price shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis at Closing by the
amount of such excess and (ii) the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis at Closing by the amount of such deficiency. 

SECTION 3.3. _Post-Closing Determination_. Within 30 days after the Closing
Date, SAVVIS will prepare and deliver to the Buyer a separate report (the "
_Closing Working Capital Report_ ") setting forth the actual Net Working
Capital as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Adjusted Net
Working Capita_ l"). The Closing Working Capital Report shall be prepared in
the same manner as the October Working Capital Report and following the
accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods employed in preparing
the October Working Capital Report.



 

11 During the preparation of the Closing Working Capital Report by SAVVIS and the
period of any dispute with respect to the application of this Section 3.3,
the Buyer shall cooperate with SAVVIS to the extent reasonably requested by
SAVVIS to prepare the Closing Working Capital Report and the Closing Adjusted
Net Working Capital or to investigate the basis for any dispute. The Buyer
shall, not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Report, deliver a report thereon (the " _Buyer s Adjusted Net Working
Capital Report_") to SAVVIS. The Buyers Adjusted Net Working Capital Report
shall list those items included in the Closing Working Capital Report, if any,
to which the Buyer takes exception and the Buyers proposed adjustment. If the
Buyer fails to deliver to SAVVIS the Buyers Adjusted Net Working Capital
Report within 30 calendar days following receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Report or does not set forth any exceptions, the Buyer shall be deemed
to have accepted the Closing Working Capital Report for the purposes of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 3.4 and for all other
purposes of this Agreement. If SAVVIS does not give the Buyer notice of its
objections to the Buyers Adjusted Net Working Capital Report within 30
calendar days following receipt of the Buyers Adjusted Net Working Capital
Report, SAVVIS shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Working Capital
Report as adjusted by the Buyer in the Buyers Adjusted Net Working Capital
Report for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section
3.4. If SAVVIS gives the Buyer notice of its objections to the Buyers
Adjusted Net Working Capital Report, and if SAVVIS and the Buyer are unable,
within 15 calendar days after receipt by the Buyer of the notice from SAVVIS
of objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such disputed exceptions
will be referred to Deloitte and Touche USA LLP or another firm of independent
certified public accountants (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") mutually
acceptable to SAVVIS and the Buyer. The Independent Accounting Firm shall,
within 60 days following its selection, deliver to SAVVIS and the Buyer a
written report determining such disputed exceptions (and only such disputed
exceptions), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties thereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 3.4. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm
acting under this Section 3.3 shall be apportioned between the Buyer and
SAVVIS based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in
favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm as the aggregate
disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar
value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accounting
Firm. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery and timing of receipt of any
document sent by the parties pursuant to this Section 3 shall be governed by
the provisions set forth in Section 13.5  "Notices."



 

12 SECTION 3.4. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

(a) If (i) the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, as finally determined
under Section 3.3, is less than the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital
and (ii) the amount of such deficiency is greater than $45,000, SAVVIS shall,
within three calendar days following the final determination of the Closing
Adjusted Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.3, and based upon
such final determination, pay to the Buyer the amount of such deficiency in
cash, together with interest on such amount from and including the Closing

Adjusted Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.3, and based upon such
final determination, pay to SAVVIS the amount of such excess in cash,

but excluding the date of payment at a rate of 6.0% per annum. Any payment by

contemplated by this Agreement. The Licenses and Permits are sufficient and
adequate in all respects to permit the continued lawful conduct of the
Business immediately after the Closing in the manner now conducted, and none

sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock, membership units
or partnership interests or similar transaction involving the Company and the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that this Section

exchange offer or other business combination involving SAVVIS Parent or any
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of SAVVIS Parents consolidated
assets; provided that no such merger, tender offer, exchange offer or other

necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable law to consummate
and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this

financing, operation, management or control of an entity providing CDN
Services or otherwise engaged in the Business (collectively, the "
_Competitive Business_ "). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, (a) SAVVIS Parent and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to,
directly or indirectly, either for themselves or for any other Person, have
any ownership interest in or participate in the financing, operation,
management or control of a Competitive Business or otherwise to have breached
any obligation set forth in this Section 7.8 if SAVVIS Parent or any of its
Affiliates (i) beneficially owns five percent or less of the equity of any
Person that engages in a Competitive Business, (ii) beneficially owns
indebtedness or other non-voting securities of any Person that engages in a
Competitive Business, or (iii) engages in a Competitive Business that results
from the acquisition of a Person that is engaged in a Competitive Business,
provided that the total revenues (the " _Revenues_ ") of such acquired Person
or acquired assets that are attributable to the Competitive Business represent
the lesser of (x) 15% of the Revenues of such Person and (y) $15 million,
provided that SAVVIS Parent and its Affiliates do not materially expand

or not engaged in any Competitive Business, that acquires all or substantially
all of the assets, business or capital stock of SAVVIS Parent or its parent

the second year anniversary of the Closing Date, each of SAVVIS Parent and
the Sellers shall not and shall cause their controlled Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, induce
or solicit for employment or engagement as a consultant, or hire or engage as
a consultant, any Transferred Employee, _provided_ , that (i) generalized
searches through media advertisement, employment firms or otherwise that are
not directed to such personnel and (ii) soliciting or hiring such individuals
following their termination of employment with Buyer shall be permitted.

to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damages. In the event of such a breach, SAVVIS Parent and the Sellers
agree that Level 3 and the Buyer shall be entitled to such injunctive relief,

that Sellers collect any Accounts Receivable (as defined in the Contribution
Agreement) which constitute Contributed Property, the Sellers shall pay the
full amount of such collected Accounts Receivable to the Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Buyer, within ten (10) Business Days of collection of such Accounts Receivable

the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any

a period of at least six years following the Closing Date. On or after the end
of such period, each party shall provide the other with at least 10 days prior

period the party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its
own expense, of such books and records (other than such books and records of
Seller which also include information that is not related to the

separated therefrom). The Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes
involving the Company, the Acquired Assets or the Business.

Property Taxes apportioned to a portion of a period for which the other party
has liability in accordance with Section 7.11(c). Upon payment of any such
Property Tax, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying
party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled under Section 7.11(c), together with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying
party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 30
days after the presentation of such statement.



 

41 SECTION 7.12. _Additional Assets_. If at any point prior to the 12-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, any assets of the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries that are Contributed Property that have not been contributed to
the Company pursuant to the Contribution Agreement or transferred to the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (such assets are herein referred to as the "
_Additional Assets_ "), other than the Excluded Assets, are discovered, then
the Buyer may deliver notice to SAVVIS, on or before such 12-month
anniversary, requesting delivery of such Additional Assets and stating in
reasonable detail the grounds for Buyers belief that such Additional Assets
constitute Contributed Property. If Buyer so notifies SAVVIS, and SAVVIS
agrees that the Additional Assets constitute Contributed Property and should
be conveyed to Buyer, the Sellers shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and
deliver to the Buyer such Additional Assets, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens, and the Sellers shall execute and deliver to the Buyer
any further documents reasonably requested by the Buyer pursuant to Section
2.5 hereof. If SAVVIS objects to the conveyance of such Additional Assets,
SAVVIS shall notify Buyer within 10 Business Days after receipt by SAVVIS of
such notice from Buyer. If Buyer and SAVVIS are unable, within 10 Business
Days after receipt by Buyer of such notice from SAVVIS, to resolve the matter
after good faith negotiations, the dispute shall be submitted to an
arbitration in New York, New York conducted in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association, by an arbitrator appointed by the
American Arbitration Association reasonably acceptable to Buyer and SAVVIS.
The cost of any arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be borne equally by
Buyer and SAVVIS, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding. For the avoidance of doubt, the consideration for such Additional
Assets that are conveyed shall be deemed to be included in the Purchase Price
and no additional cash shall be paid for such Additional Assets by the Buyer.

SECTION 7.13. _Exclusion Option_.

(a) At any time prior to the earlier to occur of (i) three (3) days prior to
the Closing Date or (ii) the date that is 20 days following the date hereof,
the Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to exclude (the " _Exclusion
Option_ ") from the Purchased Assets any asset or contract listed in
Attachment 2B to Annex 2 hereto by delivering a written notice to
SAVVIS identifying any such excluded assets or contracts (such identified
assets and contracts, the " _Excluded Foreign Assets_ "). If the Exclusion
Option is exercised, then (i) _Annex 2_ and _Annex 3_ hereto shall be deemed
amended to delete any reference to the Excluded Foreign Assets, (ii) such
Excluded Foreign Assets shall no longer be Purchased Assets and (iii) such
Excluded Foreign Assets shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets for purposes of
this Agreement.

(b) To the extent that an Excluded Foreign Asset is a contract, the Buyer
agrees to reimburse SAVVIS for actual payments made by SAVVIS in connection
with the termination of such contracts (" _Termination Payments_ ") pursuant
to this Section 7.13, provided, however, that the amount of such reimbursement
will be reduced by the amount of any payment made by Buyer to SAVVIS under
the Transition Services Agreement in connection with the termination of such
contracts thereunder. Following the Closing, SAVVIS shall provide the Buyer
with a written notice of the Termination Payments made by SAVVIS, including
documentation in support of such amounts, and the Buyer shall promptly
reimburse SAVVIS for such Termination Payments.



 

42 (c) If in exercising an Exclusion Option the Buyer shall elect not to purchase
assets or contracts relating to a site set forth on Attachment 2B to Annex 2,
then SAVVIS shall, upon the Buyers written request, promptly (but in no event
earlier than Closing) re-route traffic from such site to an alternative site
identified by the Buyer. 

SECTION 7.14. _Cease of Use_. SAVVIS Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall cease all use of, to the extent there is the Sellers Knowledge of, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to destroy, any and all copies of
Non-Patent Intellectual Property, Software and Technology that are included in
the Contributed Property or Purchased Assets that do not constitute Other
Overlapping IP (as defined in the License Agreement).

SECTION 8. _COVENANTS OF LEVEL 3 AND THE BUYER_.

 

SECTION 8.1. _Commercially Reasonably Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer and Level 3 will, at their cost
and expense, use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable consistent with applicable law to consummate and make

contemplated hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Buyer shall execute on the Closing Date the Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 8.2. _Consents and Approvals_. The Buyer and Level 3 shall, at their
cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents
and approvals of third parties and Governmental Entities required to be

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (a) the Buyer or any
Affiliate of the Buyer be required to divest assets owned by Level 3 and its
Subsidiaries or (b) the Company be required to divest assets owned by it as of

Contribution Agreement prior to the Closing. The Buyer and Level 3 shall
cooperate with the Sellers in obtaining all consents required hereunder.

Level 3 shall promptly give written notice with particularity upon having

Section 8.3 shall qualify any representation or warranty of the Buyer or Level
3 or the conditions to the obligations of each of the Sellers.



 

43 SECTION 8.4. _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Offers of Employment_. Not less than fifteen Business Days after the date
hereof, the Buyer shall offer employment to the Business Employees listed on
_Schedule 8.4_ , such offers to be effective as of the Closing Date, provided
such employees continue as employees of the Business on the Closing Date. The
Business Employees who accept such offers of employment from the Buyer shall
be referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ". Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8.4, any offer of employment the Buyer determines to
make shall be for employment at-will by the Buyer as new employees of the
Buyer (subject to any applicable probation period not prohibited by law) to
occupy positions designated by the Buyer and pursuant to the terms and
conditions determined by the Buyer in its sole discretion; provided that such
terms and conditions are at least the same or reasonably comparable to the
terms and conditions as such Business Employee currently receives. Prior to
the Closing, the Sellers shall promptly notify the Buyer of any material
changes in the employment status of any Business Employee.

(b) _Liabilities for Seller Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 8.4, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall retain sponsorship
of, and all assets of, and liabilities under and with respect to, the Seller
Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms of such arrangements.

(c) _Past Service Credits_. The Transferred Employees will be granted credit
by the Buyer for their service with the Sellers and their Subsidiaries for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and paid time off benefits under
the applicable benefit plans maintained by the Buyer and its Affiliates. The
Transferred Employees (and, as applicable, their covered dependents) shall, to
the extent that they are otherwise eligible and have satisfied any applicable
limitations and conditions under the Seller Benefit Plans, be allowed to
participate in the welfare plans adopted or maintained by the Buyer without
being subject to any waiting periods or any restrictions or limitations for
pre-existing conditions; and all deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees (and, as applicable,
their covered dependents) under any Seller Benefit Plan during the portion of
the plan year of such plan ending on the date such Transferred Employees
participation in the corresponding benefit plan of the Buyer begins shall be
taken into account under such Buyer benefit plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Transferred Employees (and, as applicable, their covered dependents)
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such Buyer benefit plan.

(d) _Certain Compensation and Benefits_. Without limiting the effect of any
other provisions of this Section 8.4 and except as otherwise provided by this
Section 8.4, on and after the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries
shall promptly pay or provide when due to all Business Employees all
compensation and benefits earned or accrued prior to and through the Closing
Date pursuant to the terms of any compensation arrangements, employment
agreements and employee pension or welfare benefit plans, programs or policies
in existence as of the date hereof. On and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall promptly pay or provide, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to
promptly pay or provide, when due, to all Transferred Employees all
compensation and benefits required to be paid or provided, including pursuant
to 



 

44 the terms of this Agreement or any individual agreement with any Transferred
Employee or pursuant to the terms of any relevant agreements entered into, or
approved, by the Buyer on and after the Closing Date.

(e) _Welfare Benefits; COBRA_. All Transferred Employees shall cease to
participate in the welfare benefit plans of the Sellers and their Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date, and such welfare benefit plans shall only be required
to pay claims of Transferred Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries
required to be paid under the terms of such welfare benefit plans to the
extent incurred prior to the Closing Date. For the purposes of this Section
8.4(e), a claim shall be deemed incurred in accordance with the following:

(i) a medical, dental, or flexible spending account (including medical, dental
and dependent care flexible spending accounts) claim shall be deemed incurred
on the date the service is rendered or the product is purchased; provided,
however, a medical claim relating to a claimants hospitalizations shall be
deemed to be incurred on the date the claimant was first hospitalized;

(ii) a life insurance or dismemberment claim shall be deemed incurred on the
date of the individuals death or dismemberment;

(iii) a long-term disability claim shall be deemed incurred on the date
the individual becomes disabled under the terms of the relevant plan or
program;

(iv) with respect to short-term disability or salary continuation claims, on
each day for which income benefits are payable to the claimant; and

(v) with respect to workers compensation claims, on the date the incident
giving rise to the claim occurred.

The Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall retain all obligations and
liabilities arising under COBRA with respect to all employees of the Business,
and all "qualified beneficiaries" of such employees (including any "MandA
qualified beneficiaries"), for whom a "qualifying event" occurs on or before
the Closing Date. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall have sole responsibility
for all obligations and liabilities arising under COBRA with respect to all
Transferred Employees, and all "qualified beneficiaries" of such employees,
for whom a "qualifying event" occurs after the Closing Date. The terms
"qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" shall have the meaning
ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608 of
ERISA, and the term "MandA qualified beneficiary" shall have the meaning
ascribed to it under Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-7 of the Treasury regulations.

(f) _Paid Time Off_. With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off ("
_PTO_ ") to which any Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to the PTO
policy, a copy of which is attached as _Schedule 8.4(f)_ hereto (the " _PTO
Policy_ "), the Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable,
maintain or assume the liability for accrued PTO of Transferred Employees
(but only to the extent such accrued liability is reflected in the Net Working
Capital), and shall permit such Transferred Employees to use such PTO in
accordance with the PTO Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Buyer
deems it necessary to prevent such Transferred Employee from taking such PTO,
the Buyer shall be liable for and pay in cash to each such Transferred
Employee an amount equal to the wages relating to such PTO.



 

45 (g) _Savings Plan_. Effective as of the Closing Date: (i) the Transferred
Employees shall, pursuant to the terms of the Sellers qualified 401(k)
savings plan, cease to actively participate in such plan, (ii) the Sellers
shall cause each Transferred Employee who is a participant in such 401(k)
savings plan to become vested in his or her benefits accrued under such plan
as of the Closing Date, and (iii) the Transferred Employees shall have all
rights, including distribution rights, of terminating participants under such
401(k) savings plan. The Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary or appropriate to permit any electing Transferred Employees to
transfer their distributions (including any outstanding plan loans but
excluding after-tax contributions) from the Sellers 401(k) savings plan in a
direct rollover to a 401(k) savings plan maintained by the Buyer pursuant to
timing and rollover election procedures determined by Buyer in its sole
discretion.

(h) _Bonuses_. With respect to any 2006 incentive compensation payments to
which any Transferred Employee may be entitled pursuant to the bonus or other
annual incentive compensation programs applicable to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the date hereof (the " _Bonus Plans_ "), in
connection with the Contribution Agreement, the Buyer shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, assume the liability for such bonus and incentive payments
(but only to the extent such liability is properly accrued as of the Closing
Date and included in the Net Working Capital), assuming for purposes of such
payments that all performance measures relevant to the determination of such
payments under the Bonus Plans had been satisfied for the period beginning on
January 1, 2006 and ending on the Closing Date.

(i)  _Cooperation_. The Sellers and the Buyer agree to cooperate with each
other in good faith in effectuating the provisions of this Section 8.4, and to
furnish each other promptly with such information concerning Business
Employees and Seller Benefit Plans, arrangements or policies as is necessary
and appropriate to carry out the terms hereof. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Sellers agree to: (i) provide the Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to
communicate with the employees of the Business prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) subject to applicable law, provide the Buyer with such other personnel
records and employee benefit plan participation records as the Buyer may
reasonably request in respect of the employees of the Business.

(j) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Section 8.4 shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Sellers or of
any of their Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) with either the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and no provision
of this Section 8.4 shall create any such rights in any such persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Seller Benefit Plan or any plan or arrangement which may be established
by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate after the
Closing Date any such plans or arrangements of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

(k) _International Business Employees_. The Sellers and the Buyer consider
that the sale of the Business under this Agreement constitutes a
transfer within the meaning of



 

46 the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (as
amended or replaced) (" _Employment Regulations_ ") and that, with effect
from the Closing Date, the contracts of employment of the Business Employees
based in the United Kingdom (the " _International Business Employees_ "),
(save insofar as such contract relates to any occupational pensions scheme
rights) will have effect as if originally made between the Buyer and the
International Business Employees. The Sellers and the Buyer will each do all
such things and shall provide such co-operation and assistance as the other
may reasonably request to enable the other to meet its current statutory
obligations in relation to the International Business Employees. The Sellers
and the Buyer will each comply with their respective obligations under the
Employment Regulations in respect of the duties to provide employee liability
information and to inform and consult with the International Business
Employees or their representatives within the meaning of the Employee
Regulations. On or immediately after the Closing Date, the Buyer will deliver
to each of the International Business Employees a letter addressing the
following specific points: (i) the fact that the Buyer becomes such
International Business Employees employer; (ii) the fact that such
International Business Employees continuous employment and contractual and
statutory employment rights will be preserved by the Buyer; and (iii) an
explanation of pension options.

(l) _Liabilities for International Business Employees_. All emoluments and
outgoings (including without limitation all wages, bonuses, benefits, tax and
social security contributions) relating to the International Business
Employees shall be borne by the Sellers up to but excluding the Closing Date
(including emoluments that have accrued, but fall due after the Closing Date)
and by the Buyer with effect from and including the Closing Date and all
necessary apportionments shall be made. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold the
Sellers harmless from and against any direct or indirect costs, claims,
liabilities or losses arising out of or in connection with: (i) any claim by
an International Business Employee that the change of identity of the employer
is a significant change and to the International Business Employees
detriment; (ii) any substantial change promised to be made or purported to be
made by the Buyer to the International Business Employees working conditions;
(iii) the employment by the Buyer of the International Business Employees on
terms and conditions different from those enjoyed by them immediately before
the Closing Date; and (iv) any claim by an International Business Employee
whether in contract or tort, or under statute or other legislation or European
law and any remedy sought by reason of any act or omission of the Buyer on or
after the Closing Date.

_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate combined

SECTION 9.4. _Procedures for Indemnification_. If a party entitled to
indemnification under this Section 9 (an " _Indemnitee_ ") asserts that a
party obligated to indemnify it under this Section 9 (an " _Indemnitor_ ") has
become obligated to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, or if any
suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding is begun, made or instituted
as a result of which the Indemnitor may become obligated to an Indemnitee
hereunder, such Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Indemnitor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnitee to give prompt
notice to the Indemnitor shall not release the Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnitor
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor may, but
shall not be obligated to, upon prompt written notice to Indemnitee, assume
the defense of such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding. If the
Indemnitor furnishes such written notice, the Indemnitor shall have the sole
power to direct and control the defense of any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding. The Indemnitee shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof
by counsel of the



 

51 Indemnitees choice. The Indemnitee shall make available all information and
assistance that the Indemnitor may reasonably request and shall fully
cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense. In the event of a failure of
the Indemnitee to provide cooperation as required under this Section 9.4, the
Indemnitors obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be reduced to the
extent of the Losses with respect to which the Indemnitors ability to defend
against the action, investigation, claim or proceeding underlying such
indemnification obligation has been prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding unless (x) such compromise or settlement is
on exclusively monetary terms and shall be paid entirely by the Indemnitor
(subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(b)(i) and (ii) and 9.3(b)(i) and
(ii), which shall be controlling) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional
release in such compromise or settlement or (y) the Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to the terms of such compromise or settlement, which
consent shall not unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnitee fails to consent thereto, the Indemnitors liability with respect
to such matter, if any, shall not exceed the proposed settlement amount. If
the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to do
so, including, without limitation, the right to make any compromise or
settlement thereof, in which case, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover
the entire cost thereof from the Indemnitor (to the extent constituting
indemnifiable Losses under this Section 9) subject to the provisions of this
