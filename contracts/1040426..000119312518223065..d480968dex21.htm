(a) _Merger Consideration_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(c)_,

4.2.  _Exchange of Certificates and Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration and Paying Agent_.

 

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent prior to the Effective Time
after reasonable consultation with the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), an
amount in cash in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments in respect
of the Eligible Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_ and the Company
Equity Payments to be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.3(b)_ (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(ii) The agreement pursuant to which Parent appoints the Paying Agent (the "

acceptable to the Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed). Pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, among other
things, the Paying Agent shall (A) act as the paying agent for the payment
and delivery of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and (B) invest the Exchange Fund, if and as directed
by Parent ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the Paying Agent shall not obtain
any rights or interests in the Shares received or held by the Paying Agent for
purposes of acting under the Paying Agent Agreement); _provided_ , _however_
, that any investment shall be in obligations of or guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. government in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Financial Services, LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. To the extent that there are losses with respect
to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below
the level required to make prompt payment and delivery of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ and the
Company Equity Payments to be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 4.3(b)_, Parent shall promptly replace or restore or cause the
replacement or restoration of the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other

 



21  income resulting from such investment (if any) shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts (if any) in excess of the amounts payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_ shall be
promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as determined by
Parent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Paying
Agent Agreement.

that are (A) Certificates or (B) Book-Entry Shares notice advising such
holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include (1)
appropriate transmittal materials (including a customary letter of
transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares shall pass only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) or the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (which shall be deemed to have been
effected upon the delivery of a customary "agents message" with respect to
such Book-Entry Shares or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of such
surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement), as applicable, such materials to
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) or such Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in
exchange for the portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Eligible Shares that (A) are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_),
together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of the materials and instructions provided by the
Paying Agent and (B) are Book-Entry Shares, by book-receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender of Book-Entry
Shares (or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of surrender with respect
to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement), in each
case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(ii)_,
pursuant to such materials and instructions as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
4.2(b)(i)_, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver, out of the Exchange Fund, as promptly as
practicable to such holders, an amount in cash in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (1) the
number of Eligible Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) or
such Book-Entry Shares by (2) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



22 (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, no interest will be paid or accrued for
the benefit of any holder of Eligible Shares on any amount payable upon the
surrender of any Eligible Shares.

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Certificate that is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company or if the
consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of any such Certificate or
Certificates may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate or
Certificates is or are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable Transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying
Agent. Payment of the applicable portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company of the
Eligible Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable
evidence of a Book-Entry Share formerly representing any Eligible Shares is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this _ARTICLE IV_.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_.

 

(i) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof (if any)) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Eligible Shares for one year from and after the Closing Date shall be
delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as determined by Parent. Any
holder of Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with the
procedures, materials and instructions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
4.2_ and any holder of Company RSUs who has not received the applicable
Company Equity Payment to be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 4.3(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a
general creditor thereof for such payments (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_, as applicable) in respect thereof.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _ARTICLE IV_
, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares or Company RSUs for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



23 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in
exchange for such Certificate, issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_) equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the number of
Eligible Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by
(ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent (and any of their Affiliates) shall be entitled to (i) deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares or Company RSUs such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other applicable Tax Law, provided that, except as may be
required by reason of a change in Law following the date of this Agreement, no
such deduction or withholding on the payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be made under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, and (ii)
request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series
of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from any Person to
whom a payment is required to be made pursuant to this Agreement. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (x) shall be timely
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (y) shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or
Company RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The
Parties hereby agree to cooperate to eliminate or reduce any such deduction
or withholding.

4.3. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company RSUs_. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, (i) any vesting conditions
applicable to each Company RSU shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and (ii) each
Company RSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company RSU to receive, without interest, as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
__multiplying__ (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) Per Share Merger
Consideration, __plus__ __ any accumulated and unpaid dividend equivalent
amounts, __less__ applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; _provided_ , that with respect to any Company RSUs that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Stock Plan and
award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.

 



24 (b) _Company Equity Payments_. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the
holders of the Company RSUs the amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _
4.3(a)_ (the " _Company Equity Payments_ ") through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the holder
of a Company RSU is not and was not at any time during the applicable vesting
period a Company Employee, such amounts shall not be paid through the payroll
system, but shall be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.2_. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation shall have an amount
in cash sufficient to pay all amounts required by the foregoing sentence.

 

(c) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Company Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the treatment of Company RSUs set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any Company
RSUs or any warrants or other rights or agreements (other than this Agreement)
which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to
own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Stock
Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time.

 

4.4. _Adjustments_ _to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, from the date of this Agreement to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , the issued and outstanding Shares or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall have
been changed into a different number of Shares or securities or a different
class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
with a record date within such period shall have been declared, then the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders
of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the
Company or any other Person to take any action except to the extent consistent
with, and not otherwise prohibited by, this terms of this Agreement.

5.17. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or
have sufficient rights to use all Intellectual Property Rights material to
the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted. The
foregoing sentence is not, and shall not be construed as, a representation or
warranty regarding non-infringement, misappropriation or other violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Intellectual Property Rights of
other Persons. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title
to all material Intellectual Property Rights owned or Purported to be Owned

Property Rights_ "), free and clear of any Encumbrance except for Permitted
Encumbrances.

be Owned in whole or in part by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and

No Company Owned Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding
Order adversely affecting the validity or enforceability of, or the Companys
or its Subsidiaries ownership or use of any such Company Owned Intellectual
Property Right. _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter

application date, as applicable, for such item and (D) the issuance,
registration or application number, as applicable, for such item.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material
written claim within the past year which has not since been resolved, (i)
contesting or challenging the validity, enforceability or ownership of any

or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective products or services
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property
Rights of any Person.

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in material liability to, or
material disruption of the business operations of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the conduct of each of
the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of the
respective products and services of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided by the Company or any applicable Subsidiary (i) does not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person and (ii) has

 



42  not, since the Applicable Date, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under, or in breach of, any
material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or is otherwise bound, pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries receives a license to third-party Software, where such
default or breach would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability or material disruption to the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, since the Applicable Date, no Person has

Applicable Date, commercially reasonable actions (including
the implementation, use, and maintenance of commercially reasonable
technical, physical and administrative safeguards) to protect, preserve,
maintain, and secure the performance, security, operation, and integrity of
the IT Assets (and all Software, information and data stored or contained
thereon), and have implemented commercially reasonable disaster recovery and
business continuity plans. The IT Assets operate and perform in a manner that
is adequate and sufficient in all material respects for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, there has been no
breach, outage, violation, data loss or unauthorized access to or of any such
IT Assets since the Applicable Date.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries take commercially reasonable actions to
protect and secure the Trade Secrets (including source code) owned or
Purported to be Owned by and material to the Company and its respective
Subsidiaries, and any other material Trade Secrets (including source code)
that the Company or its respective Subsidiaries are required to protect and
secure pursuant to written contract, and no Person has gained unauthorized
access to any such Trade Secrets (including source code) in the Companys or
its Subsidiarys possession or control, in each case, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Software owned or Purported to be
Owned or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is free of any
material defects that would prevent such Software from performing in
accordance with their respective specifications in a manner that would
materially and adversely affect the use, functionality, or performance of such
Software.

 

(i) No source code for any material Company Owned Software (excluding any Open
Source Code) has been accessed by (or delivered, licensed or made available
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to) any escrow agent or other
Person, other than current or past employees, contractors or consultants of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries subject to a binding, written
agreement imposing on such Person reasonable confidentiality obligations in
favor of the Company or applicable Subsidiary with respect to such source
code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any duty or
obligation (whether present, contingent or

 



43  otherwise) to deliver, license or make available the source code for any
Company Owned Software (excluding any Open Source Code) to any escrow agent or
other Person. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or would reasonably be
expected to, require the delivery, license or disclosure of the source code
for any material Company Owned Software (excluding any third-party Open
Source Code) to any other Person other than an employee, contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with such
employees, contractors or consultants engagement by the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary and subject to a binding, written agreement imposing on
such Person reasonable confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or
its applicable Subsidiary with respect to such source code.

 

(j) (i) The use, marketing, distribution, licensing, making available, and
sale of Company Open Source Code by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
does not violate any license terms applicable to any item of Open Source Code,
which violation would have a material impact on the use of the Company Open
Source Code and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no product or
service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Software
distributed or made available by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
contains, is distributed or made available with, is being or was developed
using, or is derived from Open Source Code that is licensed under any terms
that impose or purport to impose a requirement or condition that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries grant a license under or refrain from asserting or
enforcing any of its material patent rights, or that any material Company
Owned Software or part thereof be (1) disclosed, distributed, or made
available in source code form, (2) licensed for making modifications or
derivative works or (3) redistributable at no or nominal charge, and (B) is
used or distributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner
that actually triggers such a requirement or obligation.

 

(k) Each Person who is or was involved in the creation or development of any
material Company Owned Intellectual Property Right has signed a written
agreement containing (i) an irrevocable assignment of all Intellectual
Property Rights that were created or developed by such Person on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) confidentiality provisions
protecting such Intellectual Property Rights.

(l) (i) No funding, facilities or resources of any Governmental Entity or any
university, college or other educational institution or government research

Rights, and (ii) no Governmental Entity, university, college, or other

security and data security that are commercially reasonable and (ii) used
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all third-party service
providers, outsourcers, processors or other third parties who process, store
or otherwise handle Personal Information for or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries have agreed to comply with applicable Privacy Laws and
take reasonable steps to protect and secure Personal Information from loss,
theft, misuse or unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure. To the
Knowledge of the Company, except as would not reasonably be expected to result
in material liability, any third party who has provided Personal Information
to the Company or its Subsidiaries has done so in compliance with applicable
Privacy Laws, including providing any notice and obtaining any consent
required.

 



44 (n) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and any Person acting for or on their behalf have, since the
Applicable Date, complied with all applicable Privacy Laws, all of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries applicable policies and notices and all of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries contractual obligations regarding the
protection, collection, transfer (including cross-border) and handling of

since the Applicable Date, received any notice of any material claims
(including notice from third parties acting on their behalf) of, or been
subject to any Proceedings concerning, the violation of any Privacy
Laws, applicable privacy policies, or contractual commitments with respect to
Personal Information. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that could form the basis of any such notice or claim. None of
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries publicly-facing statements or
notices regarding its collection and treatment of Personal Information are
materially misleading or materially deceptive.

 

(o) To the Knowledge of the Company, since the Applicable Date, there have
been no breaches, security incidents, misuse of or unauthorized access to or
disclosure of any Personal Information in the possession or control of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or collected, used or processed by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
not provided or been required to provide any notices to any Person in
connection with a disclosure of Personal Information, in each case, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable actions to safeguard the data and Personal Information
in their possession or control. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted commercially reasonable privacy and data security testing or audits
at reasonable and appropriate intervals and have resolved or remediated any
material privacy or data security issues or vulnerabilities identified.

payment from or on behalf of such perpetrator or third party.

 

5.18. _Insurance_.

(a)  _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list of all material Insurance Policies maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. All Insurance Policies maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries are, to the extent applicable, with reputable
insurance carriers, provide adequate coverage for all normal risks incident to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets, and are in character and amount customary for Persons
engaged in similar businesses and subject to the same or similar risks, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect, each Insurance Policy is in full force and effect
and, to the extent

 



45  applicable, all premiums due with respect to all Insurance Policies have
been paid, and, to the extent applicable, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or event of
default, or permit a termination of any of the Insurance Policies.

 

(b) With respect to each of the Proceedings set forth in the Company Reports,
no such insurer has informed the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
denial of coverage, except for such denials that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries

Section 780 of the MBCA) and regulations of any state or comparable
antitakeover provision of the restated articles of incorporation or Bylaws of

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ and the
Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (in each
case, other than to request clarification of an Acquisition Proposal that has
already been made for the purposes of assessing whether such Acquisition
Proposal is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal or
to notify the applicable Person of the existence of the provisions of this

or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal;

 



55 (iii) disclose any non-public information or data concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry, proposal or request for information that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal;

(vi) otherwise purposefully facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(vii) agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this

_Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained, in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that is made after the date of this Agreement (and in
any event only if the Company did not violate _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ in any
material respect with respect to such Person), the Company may, subject to
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_: 

(i) provide information and data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
and access to the Company and its Subsidiaries properties, books and records
in response to a request to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that as promptly as practicable (but in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours after the provision of such information or data), the Company
shall make available to Parent any such information or data concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any such Person that
was not previously made available to Parent and that, prior to furnishing any
such information, the Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms that are at least as
restrictive to the other party as the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement
are on Parent ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that such confidentiality agreement
need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the making or
amending of an Acquisition Proposal to the extent such Acquisition Proposal
is made directly to the Company, but shall not include any restrictions that
would reasonably be expected to restrain the Company from satisfying its
obligations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ or that would otherwise
call for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company prior to the
termination of this Agreement) (any confidentiality agreement satisfying such
criteria, a " _Permitted Confidentiality Agreement_ "); and

 



56 (ii) engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any such Person regarding such unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal, in each case of clause (i) and this clause (ii) of this _Section_ __
_ 7.2(b)_, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause
(i) or this clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, the Company Board
determines in good faith that (A) based on the information then available and
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) based on the
information then available, including the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and those of this Agreement, failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that prior to engaging or otherwise participating in any
such discussions or negotiations with or furnishing any information to such
Person, the Company gives Parent written notice in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 7.2(c)_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that any action that if
taken by the Company would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ is taken
by (x) a director or officer of the Company or (y) investment bankers or
financial advisors retained by the Company, such action shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ by the Company.

(c) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall promptly (but, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give notice to Parent if (i) any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, (ii) any non-public information or data concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries is requested in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations relating to an Acquisition
Proposal are sought to be engaged in or continued with, it, its Subsidiaries
or any of its or any of their respective Representatives, setting forth in
such notice a summary of the material terms and conditions with respect to
any such proposal or offer and a summary of the material content of any such
inquiry, as applicable, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a prompt basis of the status and material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposals or requests (including any amendments, modifications or
supplements thereto, within twenty-four (24) hours following receipt thereof)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the
Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other
information.

 

(d) _No Change of Recommendation_.

 

(i) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)_, the Company Board, including any committee thereof, shall not:

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify) the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub;

 



57 (B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 

(C) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or proposal reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or
publicly propose to enter into, or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement;

 

(D) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section_ __
_ 7.2(d)(ii)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, cause or permit the Company to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or

 

(E) agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board
may (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if (x)(1) an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith is _bona
fide_ and that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ is received by the Company
and is not withdrawn, and the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening
Event has occurred, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) take action to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with,  _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith is _bona fide_ and that did not arise from or in connection with a
breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that (1) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Change of
Recommendation or action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.3(b)_ may not be made (i) unless the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_
and (ii) unless and until the Company has given Parent written notice of such
action four (4) Business Days in advance (an " _Initial Notice_ "), setting
forth in writing that the Company Board intends to consider whether to take
such action, the reasons with respect thereto and (I) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and (II) in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonable description of
such Intervening Event (it being agreed that, in each case, the delivery of
such notice by the Company shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation).
After giving such Initial Notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or taking such action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, the Company shall, and shall instruct its legal and
financial

 



58  advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
throughout such four (4) Business Day period (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation or to
take such action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_ would no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. At the end
of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Change
of Recommendation or taking action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any
other information offered by Parent in response to the Initial Notice, and
shall have determined in good faith that (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in
each case, if such changes offered in writing were to be given effect. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ except that
the obligation to give advance written notice with respect thereto as set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ shall be reduced to three (3)
Business Days.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and such disclosure and
communication shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such disclosure or communication has the substantive
effect of withdrawing, qualifying or modifying the Company Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, such disclosure or communication shall constitute a
Change of Recommendation unless the Company expressly reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such disclosure or communication.

(f) _Standstill Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend
or otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any such
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

7.3. _Company Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the filing
of the definitive Proxy Statement (the " _Original Date_ ") to secure the
Requisite Company Vote in respect of the approval of the Merger and this

Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law and

actions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , that the Company
shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of
such "tail" insurance policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good

Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be

cooperation shall be required to the extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other
liability prior to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed
or simultaneously indemnified, (C) subject any director, officer or employee

10.7. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are special,
unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or
damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedies a Party may have in equity or at law, each Party shall be
entitled to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to obtain or to seek an injunction restraining any breach or
violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this
Agreement, consistent with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.6(a)_, in
the Chosen Courts without necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security. In the event that any Proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each
Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

(b) To the extent any Party brings a Proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than a
Proceeding to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such Proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established
by the court presiding over such Proceeding.

10.8. _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) from and after the Effective
Time, the Indemnified Parties with respect to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 7.10_ as provided for therein and (b) from and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Shares and the holders of Company RSUs shall be third-party
beneficiaries with respect to their respective rights to receive the
consideration payable pursuant to _ARTICLE IV_ , the Parties hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any Person (other than the Parties and those Persons referred
to in clauses (a) and (b) of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.8_, but only to the
extent expressly provided for in this Agreement) or their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns any rights or
remedies, express or implied, hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.8_, the Company shall have the 

 



81  right to recover through an action brought by the Company for itself and on
behalf of its shareholders, and Parent shall have the right to recover through
an action brought by Parent, damages (which, in the case of an action brought
by the Company, shall be determined by reference to the total amount that
would have been recoverable by the Companys shareholders if all such
shareholders brought an action against Parent and were recognized as third-
party beneficiaries hereunder and which damages Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge are not limited to the Companys out-of-pocket expenses) from the
other Party in the event of an intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud,
which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender Related Parties are
third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.8_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_, _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ (and any
related definitions used in those sections) to the extent such provisions
expressly pertain to the Lender Related Parties.

10.9. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires an
Affiliate of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Affiliate to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires an Affiliate of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on
the part of the Company to cause such Affiliate to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Affiliate to take such action. Any obligation of one Party to any other
Party under this Agreement which obligation is performed, satisfied or
properly fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

10.10. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Except as may be required to satisfy
the obligations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, no Party may assign any
of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties not seeking to assign any of its
rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations, except as provided
for in _Section_ __ _ 10.9_, and any attempted or purported assignment or
delegation in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ shall be null and void;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may designate another Wholly Owned
Subsidiary organized under the laws of any State of the United States to be a
constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as Parent provides the
Company with advance written notice thereof, in which event all references to
Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Wholly
Owned Subsidiary of Parent, except that all representations and warranties
made in this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other Wholly Owned Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;
_provided_ , that (a) any such designation shall not reasonably be expected
(in the Companys reasonable determination) to prevent or materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the shareholders of
the Company under this Agreement in any material respect and (b) no
assignment, delegation or designation shall relieve Parent of any of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement unless the Parties enter into a
novation.

 



82 10.11. _Entire Agreement_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure
Letter and Exhibits), the Voting Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements,
negotiations, understandings, representations and warranties, whether oral or
written, with respect to such matters.

(b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of
this Agreement, on the one hand, and the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (other than an exception expressly set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter (as
the case may be)), on the other hand, the statements in the body of this
Agreement shall control.

10.12.  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision to be
negotiated by the Parties, each acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such legal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or enforceability
of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other
jurisdiction.

10.13. _Counterparts_ _; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an
original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the
same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email
or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same
legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received one or
more counterparts hereof signed by each of the other Parties and unless and
until such receipt, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication).

ARTICLE VII

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its shareholders for money damages for any action taken or any
failure to take action as a director, except liability for any of the
following: (i) the amount of financial benefit received by a director to
which he or she is not entitled, (ii) the intentional infliction of harm on
the Corporation or the shareholders, (iii) a violation of Section 551 of the
Michigan Business Corporation Act (the "Act"), or (iv) an intentional
criminal act.

If the Act is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personally liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the Act, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing paragraph by the shareholders of the Corporation shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to actions
occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

 

ARTICLE VIII

Directors and officers of the corporation shall be indemnified in connection
with any actual or threatened action or proceeding (including civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative proceedings) arising out of their service to
the corporation or to another organization at the corporations request, and
shall be paid expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition to the fullest extent permitted by law. Persons who are
not directors or officers of the corporation may be similarly indemnified in
respect of such service to the extent authorized at any time by the Board of
Directors or the Bylaws of the corporation. The provisions of this Article
shall be applicable to actions or proceedings commenced after the adoption
hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the
adoption hereof, and to persons who have ceased to be directors, officers or
employees, and shall inure to the benefit of their heirs, executors
and administrators. The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses
conferred hereunder shall be a contract right which may not be modified
retroactively without the written consent of the director or officer and shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement
of expenses such person may have or to which such person may be entitled.

If a claim under this Article VIII is not paid in full by the corporation
with thirty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation,
the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part
in any such suit or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover advances,
the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such claim. In any action brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right hereunder (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where
the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) it shall be a
defense that, and in any action brought by the corporation to recover advances
the corporation shall be entitled to recover such advances if, the indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act. Neither
the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee
of its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act,
nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of
Directors, a committee of its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel
or its shareholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to an action brought by the indemnitee or
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. In any action brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right
hereunder or by the corporation to recover payments by the corporation of
advances, the burden of proof shall be on the corporation.
