indemnified in connection with any actual or threatened action or proceeding (including civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceedings) arising out of their service to the corporation or to another organization at the
corporation&#146;s request, and shall be paid expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the fullest extent permitted by law. Persons who are not directors or officers of the corporation may be
similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the extent authorized at any time by the Board of Directors or the Bylaws of the corporation. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to actions or proceedings commenced after the
adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the adoption hereof, and to persons who have ceased to be directors, officers or employees, and shall inure to the benefit of their heirs, executors and
administrators. The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred hereunder shall be a contract right which may not be modified retroactively without the written consent of the director or officer and shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses such person may have or to which such person may be entitled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a claim under this
Article VIII is not paid in full by the corporation with thirty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.
If successful in whole or in part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover advances, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such claim. In any action brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) it
shall be a defense that, and in any action brought by the corporation to recover advances the corporation shall be entitled to recover such advances if, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee of its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the
indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee of its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to an action brought by the indemnitee or create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct. In any action brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder or by the corporation to recover payments by the corporation of advances, the burden of proof shall be on the corporation. </P>
