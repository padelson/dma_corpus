---|---|--- 



     | 10.13.6 | Certain BOMAG Group Companies manufactured certain walk-
behind rollers and plates, rubber tire rollers and single drum rollers in
Germany between 1969 and 1994 that included a component part containing
asbestos. To the 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 35 - Sellers Knowledge, a total of approximately 7,000 of those units were
manufactured in Germany and shipped to the United States for distribution
during the time period of approximately 1981 to current (records do not exist
for earlier periods). Seller believes approximately five percent (5%) of units
shipped to the United States were distributed to countries outside of the
United States after they reached BOMAG Americas U.S. plant.



Seller estimates that the normal lifespan of these units is as follows: (i)
walk-behind rollers and plates up to ten (10) years, and (ii) large, ride-
on rollers: up to 15 years. The walk-behind rollers and plates were
manufactured between 1969 and 1988. With a 10-year life-span, Seller believes
most of these type rollers and plates are no longer in service. The rubber
tire rollers with asbestos containing components were manufactured between
1980 and 1994. The single drum rollers with asbestos containing components
were manufactured between 1980 and 1989. With a 15-year life span, Seller
believes that most of the units manufactured prior to 1990 would no longer be
in service.



Finally, most units would require routine maintenance and replacement of the
asbestos containing components at approximately the five-year point after
manufacture. Any unit, which underwent such maintenance may have had any such
asbestos component replaced with non-asbestos component parts.

reasonable likelihood of a determination that would have a Material Adverse
Effect.



     | 10.14.2 | Threatened Proceedings

No claim, legal action, proceeding, suit, litigation, prosecution,
investigation, enquiry or arbitration against any BOMAG Group Company has

   10.19 | Sellers Knowledge 
---|--- 



Any Purchasers Assumption qualified by the expression to "Sellers Knowledge"
or any similar expression shall mean that none of the persons whose names are
set out in Annex 10.19 positively knows that such Purchasers Assumption would
be incorrect or incomplete if made without such qualification.



   11 | Sellers Liability 
---|--- 



If and to the extent that a Purchasers Assumption pursuant to Section 10,
above, is incorrect or incomplete, the following provisions of Sections
11 and 12, below, shall apply, it being understood (i) that according to the
joint intention of the Parties those provisions shall originally and finally
define the legal and contractual consequences of, and provide the exclusive
remedy for, the incorrectness of any of the Purchasers Assumptions, (ii)
that these provisions and the Purchasers Assumptions made in Section 10 above
shall constitute one integral, unseverable provision regarding the allocation
of risks between Seller and Purchaser, irrespective of fault, and (iii) that
claims under these provisions can only be raised by Purchaser after Closing.



   11.1 | Insofar as a Purchasers Assumption pursuant to Section 10 above
should be incorrect or incomplete, the Seller shall be entitled to put, either
Purchaser or the BOMAG Group Company, as the case may be, in the situation
they would have been in, had the Purchasers Assumption been correct. This
shall apply irrespective of whether such Purchasers Assumption is made with
regard to a quality ( _Beschaffenheit_ ) of the BOMAG Group Companies or not. 
---|--- 



   11.2 | The Purchaser shall promptly inform Seller without undue delay (
_unverz uglich_) of any alleged breach of Purchasers Assumption and shall set
a deadline of at least one month to enable Seller to put, either Purchaser or
the BOMAG Group Company, as the case may be, in the situation they would have
been in, had the Purchasers Assumption been correct. If Purchaser fails to
comply with its obligation to inform Seller under this Section 11.2, then
Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claims or receive any payment,
indemnity or relief for the acts or circumstances giving rise to the
Purchasers claim except to the extent Purchaser proves that Seller is not
disadvantaged by such failure. 
---|--- 



 

\- 38 - put, either Purchaser or the BOMAG Group Company, as the case may be, in the
position they would have been in, had the Purchasers Assumption been correct
and to restore conformity pursuant to Section 11.1, above, Seller is (under
express deviation from the calculation method provided for in Section 441 para
3 BGB) obliged to pay to the Purchaser the amount of the Loss suffered by the
Purchaser or any of the BOMAG Group Companies, provided, however, that the
following limitations and those in Section 12 shall apply: 
---|--- 



     | 11.3.1 | Purchaser may only recover for established Losses; 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.2 | no amount is payable for consequential damages, damage to
reputation, lost business opportunities, lost profits, mental or emotional
distress, interference with business operations, diminution in value, loss of
good will, or other indirect damages; 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.3 | no amount is payable if and to the extent Seller
demonstrates that such Loss might or could have been avoided or mitigated by
reasonable acts or measures of the Purchaser;  
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.4 | no amount is payable if (a) the Loss (i) is covered by
any insurance contract (up to the recovered amount) or (ii) would have been
covered by insurance contracts as existing on Closing had they been continued
without change or (b) any other third party is liable for this Loss, up to
effective indemnification; 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.5 | any cash advantages (including tax benefits) of Purchaser
or the BOMAG Group Companies demonstrated by Seller in connection with such
additional Loss shall be deducted from amounts payable to Purchaser; this
shall also apply to deductions in case of replacement of old items by new
items; 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.6 | the maximum amount to be assessed for continuous or
periodical expenditure is capped at an amount equal to five times the yearly
expenditure; 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.3.7 | Purchasers Losses shall be reduced by any applicable
reserves or accruals reflected in the financial statements of the BOMAG Group
Companies. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.4 | Purchaser shall have claims based upon an incorrect Purchasers
Assumption only if an individual claim exceeds an amount of US$ 100,000 and,
in addition, only if the aggregate amount of such claims exceeds US$
4,000,000 ( _Freigrenze_ ), in which case the Purchaser shall be entitled to
claim only the amount as from the first USD exceeding a deductible of US$
3,000,000 ( _Freibetrag_ ), such deductible being included in the US$
4,000,000 threshold. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | Purchaser shall not be entitled to any recovery, relief or claim
for the incorrectness of any Purchasers Assumption or for any other failure
of Seller under this Agreement, if Purchaser knew or should have known that
such Purchasers Assumption or 
---|--- 



 

\- 39 - underlying fact was incorrect on or before the Closing Date. For the purposes
of this Section, the information in the Annexes, the Disclosure Schedule,
including any updates received by the Purchaser until the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 14.16. and the Disclosed Information made available to
the Purchaser and the due diligence, which the Purchaser confirms it has
completed to its satisfaction, are deemed to be known to the Purchaser.



   11.6 | Purchaser shall not have any claims and shall not be entitled to
any recovery or relief if it requests compensation for Third Party Claims and
has failed to comply with Section 12. 
---|--- 



   11.7 | Unless provided otherwise herein, the claims of Purchaser based
upon an incorrect Purchasers Assumption shall be time-barred on September 30,
2006. Claims of Purchaser against the Seller under Section 10.16 shall be
exclusively governed by the limitation period of Section 13.1.7. 
---|--- 



   11.8 | The regulations contained in the Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13
shall, save for mandatory statutory provisions of German law to the contrary
(especially Sections 123 and 276 para 3 BGB) apply instead of all statutory
rights a buyer has for defects of acquired companies. Every further liability
of the Seller and all deviating rights of the Purchaser, including but not
limited to the rights to void ( _Anfechtung_ ), rescind ( _R ucktritt_ /
_Wandlung_ ) or terminate ( _K undigung_) this Agreement based on whatever
legal reason including violation of pre-contractual duty (c _ulpa in
contrahendo_ ), violation of contractual duties (
_positive Vertragsverletzung_ ), frustration of contract ( _Wegfall der Gesch
aftsgrundlage_) are herewith explicitly excluded. 
---|--- 



   11.9 | Purchaser understands and agrees that the rights accorded by
Section 11 in respect of Section 10.13 of this Agreement are its sole and
exclusive remedy against Seller with respect to any Environmental matters
whatsoever. Purchaser hereby waives any right to seek contribution or other
recovery from Seller or from any of its Affiliates that it may now or in the
future ever have under any Environmental Law, including, without limitation,
42 U.S.C. §§ 9607 and 9613(f) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), Sec. 4, Sec. 7, and Sec. 24 of the
German Federal Soil Protection Act, and similar provisions under any other
Environmental Law, as such laws were in the past or are currently in effect,
or may in the future be enacted or be in effect. Purchaser hereby further
unconditionally releases Seller and its Affiliates from any and all claims,
demands and causes of action that it may now or in the future ever have
against either Seller or any of its Affiliates for recovery under CERCLA or
under any other Environmental Law as such laws were in the past or are
currently in effect, or may in the future be enacted or be in effect. 
---|--- 



 

\- 40 - ---|--- 



If the matter or circumstance that may give rise to a claim against the Seller
under this Agreement is a result of or in connection with a claim by
or liability to a third party ("Third Party Claim") then:



   12.1 | The Purchaser shall inform Seller, and Seller shall inform
Purchaser of any events and circumstances that may have an effect on the
obligations of Seller set forth hereunder without undue delay ( _unverz
uglich_), however, within 15 days of the date it has knowledge of such event
or circumstance at the latest. 
---|--- 



   12.2 | No admissions in relation to such Third Party Claim shall be
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser
(including the BOMAG Group Companies) and the claim shall not be compromised,
disposed of or settled without the written consent of the Seller. 
---|--- 



   12.3 | Purchaser and/or the BOMAG Group Companies shall have to, at the
choice of Seller, either (i) take all measures to defend against such claims,
file all remedies against any court judgments or public orders or reject such
Third Party Claims and pursue the respective proceedings or matters or (ii)
irrevocably authorize Seller or any persons designated by Seller to take (at
their own expense) any measures to defend against such claims as with respect
to the respective court judgments, public orders or claims, in particular to
reject or accept such claims, enter into negotiations, file remedies and
pursue the respective proceedings and enter into settlement agreements for
and on behalf of Purchaser and/or the BOMAG Group Companies. 
---|--- 



   12.4 | The Purchaser shall, and the Purchaser shall procure that any
Affiliates of the Purchaser shall, give subject to their being paid all
reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses, all such information and
assistance including access to premises and personnel, and the right to
examine and copy or photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records, as
the Seller may reasonably request. Furthermore, Purchaser and/or the BOMAG
Group Companies shall assign to Seller any claims which Purchaser and/or the
BOMAG Group Companies may have against any parties in connection with the
matters to be indemnified hereunder to the extent and within the
limitations, Seller has paid to Purchaser any amount in relation to such
Third Party Claim. 
---|--- 



   13 | Taxes 
---|--- 



   13.1 | Tax Indemnity 
---|--- 



     | 13.1.1 | The Seller shall indemnify or cause the Relevant
Shareholders to indemnify the Purchaser against any and all liabilities for
Taxes of the BOMAG Group Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the
Straddle Period to the extent such Taxes are not paid prior to the Closing
Date, and with respect to 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 41 - the Straddle Period only to the extent that pursuant to Section 13.1.2 such
Taxes are allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date
("Indemnified Taxes").



     | 13.1.2 | With respect to the Straddle Period, the Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | in the case of Taxes that are: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | based upon or related to actual or deemed income or
receipts; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | imposed or payable in connection with any actual or deemed
service, sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible); or  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | required to be deducted from any actual or deemed payment,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable period ended
on (and included) the Closing Date; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in the case of Taxes not falling within Section (i) and
imposed or payable on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of any BOMAG
Group Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of
such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on (and including)
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | in the case of other Taxes not falling within Section (i)
or Section (ii), deemed equal to an amount calculated on a just and reasonable
basis. 
---|---|--- 


In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth
or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated
under this Section 13.1.2 shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to effect the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the BOMAG Group Companies if and to the extent such prior practice
complies with the applicable GAAP and Tax regulations.



     | 13.1.3 | Section 13.1.1 shall also apply if any of the BOMAG Group
Companies is assessed for Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or the Straddle
Period and such assessment is caused by the pure shift of Taxes into
different Tax years ( _Phasenverschiebung_ ). The amount of indemnification
shall be reduced by the net present value of the Purchasers, any member of
the Purchaser Groups or BOMAG Group Companies Tax savings generated after
the Closing Date as a direct or indirect result of the facts or changes that
led to the Indemnified Taxes using a discounting factor of 4%. 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 42 - relating to Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the Straddle Period,
which is higher than a corresponding amount reflected in the last financial
statements, Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the exceeding amount net after
taxes, but with respect to the Straddle Period only to the extent that such
Tax Refund is allocable pursuant to this Section to the period ending on the
Closing Date. Any Tax Refund relating to the Straddle Period shall be
allocated based upon the method employed in Section 13.1.2 taking into account
the type of Tax to which the Tax Refund relates. 
---|---|--- 


     | 13.1.5 | Payments of the Seller or the Relevant Shareholder to the
Purchaser shall be considered to be a reduction of the Purchase Price and
shall in no case give the relevant BOMAG Group Company a right or claim
against the Seller. Payments of the Purchaser to the Seller represent an
increase of the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.1.6 | The payments of the Seller or the Relevant Shareholder to
be made pursuant to this Section 13.1 are due five bank working days before
the due date of the respective Taxes of the relevant BOMAG Group Company,
unless the amount is being contested by the Seller and not payable because of
such contest. If and to the extent any such contest being successful
subsequently, such payments will be refunded to the Seller. Payments of the
Purchaser to the Seller are due five Business Days after the payment of the
Tax reimbursement or Tax refund to the relevant BOMAG Group Company,
respectively in the event of a set-off, five Business Days after the set-
off.  
---|---|--- 



     | 13.1.7 | The claims pursuant to this Section 13.1 will become
time-barred in each relevant jurisdiction upon the expiry of a six-month
period after the final expiration of all relevant statutes of limitation
periods ( _Festsetzungsfristen_ ) for the relevant Taxes in such relevant
jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 



   13.2 | Conduct of Tax Claims 
---|--- 



     | 13.2.1 | After the Closing, if the Purchaser or any other member
of Purchasers Group (including without limitation any BOMAG Group Company)
become aware of a Tax Claim relevant for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or for
the Straddle Period, or of a Tax Audit in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period or of the Straddle Period, then the Purchaser shall notify the Seller
in writing of the Tax Claim or Tax Audit as soon as reasonably practicable.
Such notice shall contain factual information describing the Tax Claim or Tax
Audit in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Tax Authority in respect of any such Tax Claim or
Tax Audit. The Purchaser shall, subject to Section 13.2.2 and 13.2.3, take, or
cause the BOMAG Group Company to take, such action as the Seller may
reasonably request to avoid, resist, appeal or compromise the Tax Claim or
deal with the Tax Audit. The Purchaser shall cause any BOMAG Group Company
which becomes aware of a Tax Claim relevant for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or
for the Straddle Period or of a Tax Audit in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period or of the Straddle Period to notify the Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable. 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 43 - ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to any Straddle Period in which the number of calendar days
in the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date is greater than or
equal to 183 days (pro rata for any Straddle Period not one year in
duration), 
---|---|--- 



the following shall apply:



     | (a) | if the Seller notifies the Purchaser of the intention to
direct and control the conduct of any such Tax Claim or Tax Audit within 30
calendar days of receipt of the notice of Tax Claim or Tax Audit from the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 13.2.1, the Seller shall have the sole right to
direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its expense,
the conduct of any such Tax Claim or Tax Audit and the Purchaser shall fully
cooperate (and shall cause the BOMAG Group Companies to fully cooperate) at
the Sellers expense, limited to any third party expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with the obligations under this Section as long as
substantial expenses were approved by the Seller in advance, in each phase of
such conduct; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if the Seller does not notify the Purchaser under Section
(a) within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice of Tax Claim or Tax Audit
from the Purchaser pursuant to Section 13.2.1, the Purchaser and any BOMAG
Group Company may assume control of such Tax Claim or Tax Audit (at the
Purchasers own expense). The Seller shall have the right (at its own cost) to
review and comment on the documents and proposed actions in relation to such
Tax Claim or Tax Audit prior to the filing of such documents or the taking of
such actions, and the Purchaser shall take account of the reasonable comments
of the Seller to the extent they relate to matters which may give rise to a
liability of the Seller under this Agreement. Neither of the Purchaser nor any
BOMAG Group Company may settle or compromise the Tax Claim without prior
written consent of the Seller; provided, however, that consent to settlement
or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if in accordance with Section (a) the Seller has control of
a Tax Claim or Tax Audit that relates to a Straddle Period, the Purchaser
shall have the right (at its own cost) to review and comment on the documents
and proposed actions in relation to such Tax Claim or Tax Audit prior to the
filing of such documents or the taking of such actions, and the Seller shall
take account of the reasonable 
---|---|--- 


 

\- 44 - comments of the Purchaser to the extent they relate to matters which may not
give rise to a liability of the Seller under Section 13.2.1. The Seller may
not settle or compromise a Tax Claim which may not give rise to a liability of
the Seller under Section 13.2.1 without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, provided that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



     | 13.2.3 | In the case of a Tax Claim or Tax Audit which relates to
any Straddle Period in which the number of calendar days in the taxable period
ending on (and including) the Closing Date is less than 183 days (pro rata
for any Straddle Period not one year in duration), the following shall apply: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Purchaser and any BOMAG Group Company shall have the
sole right to direct and control, through counsel of their own choosing and at
their expense, the conduct of any such Tax Claim or Tax Audit; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Seller shall have the right (at its own cost) to review
and comment on the documents and proposed actions in relation to such Tax
Claim or Tax Audit prior to the filing of such documents or the taking of
such actions, and the Purchaser shall take account of the reasonable comments
of the Seller to the extent they relate to matters which may give rise to a
liability of the Sellers under Section 13.2.1. Neither the Purchaser nor any
BOMAG Group Company may settle or compromise a Tax Claim which may give rise
to a liability of the Seller under Section 13.2.1 without the prior written
consent of the Seller, provided that consent to settlement or compromise shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
---|---|--- 



   13.3 | Preparation of Non-Consolidated Tax Returns 
---|--- 



     | 13.3.1 | In respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Straddle
Period, the Purchaser shall on a basis consistent with those Tax Returns
prepared in the past and on the basis of the annual accounts prepared
consistent with past practice to the extent that such practice comply with
both the applicable GAAP and tax regulations, cause the BOMAG Group Companies
to prepare and file all Non-Consolidated Tax Returns for the BOMAG Group
Companies. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its authorized
representative with a copy of each such completed draft Non-Consolidated Tax
Return and the draft annual accounts at least 30 calendar days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Non-
Consolidated Tax Return. In the event that the Purchaser or a BOMAG Group
Company proposes to make any amendment to a draft Non-Consolidated Tax Return
or the draft annual accounts provided to the Seller before it is filed, the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a copy of the revised draft Non-
Consolidated Tax Return and the revised annual accounts as soon as reasonably
practicable prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and
its authorized representative shall have the 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 45 - right to review and comment on such Non-Consolidated Tax Return and annual
accounts prior to the filing of such Non-Consolidated Tax Return and no such
Non-Consolidated Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written consent
of the Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



     | 13.3.2 | The Purchaser shall procure that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Seller and their duly authorized agents are afforded
such information and assistance as it or they reasonably require to enable the
Seller to review and comment the Non-Consolidated Tax Returns and the annual
accounts. The Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for any third party
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the obligations under this
Section 13.2 as long as substantial expenses were approved by the Seller in
advance; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Sellers are promptly provided with a copy of any
material communication from any Tax Authority insofar as it relates to the tax
affairs of any BOMAG Group Company in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Period
or the Straddle Period. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.3.3 | For the avoidance of doubt, where any matter relating to
Taxes gives rise to a Tax Claim for which the Seller may be liable, the
provisions of Section 13.2 (Conduct of Claims) shall apply to the effect
that, in relation to that matter, the provisions of Section 13.2 shall take
precedence over the provisions of this Section 13.3. 
---|---|--- 



   13.4 | Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information 
---|--- 



     | 13.4.1 | The Seller and the Purchaser shall without undue delay (
_unverz uglich_) provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall
cause the BOMAG Group Companies to provide such cooperation and information)
in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining
a Tax liability or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any Tax Audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and for the Straddle Period. Such cooperation and
information shall in particular include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents
relating to rulings by Tax Authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided under this Section 13.4. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.4.2 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall retain a copy of all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records
or other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its affiliates)
relating to Tax matters of any BOMAG Group Company for the Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and the Straddle 
---|---|--- 


 

\- 46 - Period until the later of (i) six months after the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate (taking into
account any extension or waiver thereof), or (ii) six years following the due
date (taking into account any extension or waiver) for such Tax Return. After
such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall dispose of such
documentation in its possession (or in the possession of its affiliates), the
other party shall be given an opportunity after 90 calendar days prior
written notice to receive, to remove and retain all or any part of such
documents as such other party may select (at such other partys expense).



   13.5 | Limitations 
---|--- 



     | 13.5.1 | Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in this
Agreement, the Seller shall not be obliged to indemnify the Purchaser under
this Section 13 if and to the extent that:  
---|---|---

     | (iii) | the Indemnified Taxes would not have arisen but for Tax
Elections made (or omitted to be made) after the Closing Date by the Purchaser
or any BOMAG Group Company, other than Tax Elections taking place with the
written approval of the Seller; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the Indemnified Taxes would not have arisen but for any
action or omission of the Purchaser or BOMAG Group Company after the Closing
Date, but excluding any action or omission:  
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | carried out (or omitted) pursuant to a legally binding
obligation of any BOMAG Group Company incurred before Closing; or

     | (b) | carried out (or omitted) pursuant to an obligation imposed
by any law, regulation or requirement having the force of law; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (c) | taking place at the written request or with the written
approval of the Seller; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | such Indemnified Taxes arise or are increased as a
consequence of any change in the law (including subordinate legislation) or in
the generally published interpretation or practice of any Tax Authority
coming into force after Closing, provided that, the change was not announced
