prior to the Measurement Time which are paid within one hundred eighty (180)
days following the Measurement Time, (II) all recoveries and  repayments of
Medical Claims incurred and paid prior to the Measurement Time which are

reflect the aggregate dollar amount of (I) the total amount of premium
capitation for services performed by the RBC  Entities and SWH MA with
respect to the period of time prior to the Measurement Time that are received
by the RBC Entities and SWH MA after the Measurement Time and within one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Measurement Time, and  (II) a good-
faith estimate of all premium capitation for services performed by the RBC
Entities and SWH MA with respect to the period of time prior to the
Measurement Time which have not been received by the RBC Entities and SWH MA
within one  hundred eighty (180) days following the Measurement Time; and (C)
the Provider Advances Receivable shall reflect the aggregate dollar amount of
all Provider Advances outstanding as of the Measurement Time that are repaid
before the Purchaser  delivers the Initial Statement. The Purchaser shall act
in good faith and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure the
collection, recovery or receipt of any amounts due and owing to the MCC
Business that are reflected on the Initial  Statement, in each case, in a
manner consistent with the Purchaser's policies and procedures applicable to
its other businesses in effect following the Closing. The Seller will, and to
the extent applicable, will use Commercially Reasonable  Efforts to cause its
accountants, to make available to the Purchaser such information, books and
records, work papers and, upon reasonable notice, employees responsible for
and knowledgeable about any such information, books and records or  work
papers of the Seller and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities),
in each case as may be reasonably required or useful for the Purchaser to
prepare the Initial Statement.

(b) During the sixty (60)-day period immediately following the Seller's
receipt of the Initial Statement (the " _Review           Period_
"), the Seller and its Representatives will, upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours, be permitted to review the Purchaser's work
papers, and all books and records of the Purchaser and its Affiliates 
reasonably necessary for the Seller's review of the Initial Statement and the
Purchaser will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to allow the Seller and
its Representatives, to the extent applicable, to review the work papers of
the  Purchaser's accountants related to the preparation of the Initial
Statement, and the Purchaser shall make reasonably available the individuals
in its employ (and subject to Section  1.08(e) will use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to make available its accountant's employees) responsible
for and knowledgeable about the information used in the preparation of the
Initial Statement to respond to the reasonable  inquiries of the Seller.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, it will  not take any actions with respect to any accounting
books, records, methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications and estimation methodologies on which the Initial Statement is
based or on which the Final Statement is  to be based that are materially
inconsistent with the past practice of the Purchaser or that would materially
impede or materially delay the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement or
the Final Statement unless required by Applicable Law.   Regardless of any
such actions, the Purchaser shall ensure that the calculation of the
components comprising the Final Statement shall be made in a manner and
utilizing the methods required by this Agreement. The restrictions set forth
in  this Section 1.08(c) shall apply solely for purposes of determining the
Final Statement and shall not restrict any act of the Purchaser with respect
to any accounting books,  records, methods, policies, principles procedures
practices, classifications and estimates methodologies for any other purpose,
either before or after the Final Statement becomes final and binding.

 

 

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that the sole purpose of the
determination of the components of the Final Statement is to adjust the
Closing Payment so as to  reflect the final calculations of the Closing
Adjusted Statutory Capital, Closing Insolvency Protection Reserve Capital,
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Net Asset Value, Closing Date Cash,
Closing Date Indebtedness and Seller Transaction  Expenses as compared to the
estimates thereof set forth in the Closing Notice, and not to dispute the
appropriateness of the Reference Adjusted Statutory Capital Schedule, the
Insolvency Protection Reserve Requirement Capital Schedule, the  Reference
Net Working Capital Schedule, the Reference Net Asset Value Schedule, the
Accounting Principles or the Applicable RBC Entity Accounting Principles, or
any components thereof.

(e) The accountants of the Seller or the Purchaser shall not be obliged to
make any work papers or the individuals in their employ available to the other
Party as provided in  this Section 1.08 except in accordance with such
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Party has
signed a customary agreement relating to such  access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

 

 

Section 1.09            _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to the  expiration of the Review Period if the Seller
disagrees with the Initial Statement (or any amounts set forth therein). The
Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the amounts involved and  the Seller's determination of the
disputed amounts. Any items not included in the Notice of Disagreement shall
be considered final and binding. If the Seller does not deliver a Notice of
Disagreement prior to the expiration of the Review  Period, then the Initial
Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Statement.

 

 

(b) During the thirty (30) day period immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement (the " _Consultation           Period_ "),
the Seller and the Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. If the Seller and the Purchaser are able to  resolve
their differences, then the Initial Statement, as modified by agreement of the
Seller and the Purchaser, shall be deemed to be the Final Statement.

 

 

(c) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, the Seller and the Purchaser
have been unable to resolve all differences that they may have with respect to
the matters specified  in the Notice of Disagreement, then the Seller and the
Purchaser shall each have the right to submit all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the
Initial Statement marked to indicate  those line items that are not in
dispute) to the New York office of KPMG or such other certified public
accounting firm in the United States of international recognition reasonably
acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser and agreed to by  them in writing
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Seller and the Purchaser shall
instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to make a final determination as 
promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days after its
engagement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Initial
Statement as to which the Seller and the Purchaser disagree as set out in the
Notice of  Disagreement. In making its determination pursuant to this Section
1.09(c), the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, and shall base its  determination solely on written
presentations, only to the extent consistent with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, of the Seller and the Purchaser and not by independent review.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only  those items and amounts
in the Seller's and the Purchaser's respective calculations that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Seller and the Purchaser
have been unable to agree. Such determination shall be final and binding  on
the parties absent manifest mathematical error. A copy of all materials
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall be provided by the Seller or the Purchaser, as
applicable, to the  other party concurrently with the submission thereof to
the Independent Accounting Firm. In resolving each disputed line item, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement, shall select either the  position of the Purchaser or the Seller
and may not impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or
amount disputed.

(d) The statement of Closing Adjusted Statutory Capital, Closing Insolvency
Protection Reserve Capital, Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Net Asset
Value, Closing Date Cash,  Closing Date Indebtedness and Seller Transaction
Expenses that is final and binding on the parties, as determined either
through agreement of the parties pursuant to Section 1.09(a)  or Section
1.09(b) or through the action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to
_Section 1.09(_ _c)_ , is referred to as the " _Final Statement_ ".

 

 

(e) The cost of the Independent Accounting Firm's review and determination
shall be allocated to and borne by the Purchaser and the Seller based on the
inverse of the percentage  that the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
For example, should the items in dispute total  in amount to One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000) and the Independent Accounting Firm awards Six Hundred
Dollars ($600) in favor of the Seller's position, sixty percent (60%) of the
costs of its review would be borne by the Purchaser and forty  percent (40%)
would be borne by the Seller. During the review by the Independent Accounting
Firm, the Purchaser and the Seller and their accountants will each make
available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such 
individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may
be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations as described in Section           1.09(c); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the accountants of the Seller or the Purchaser shall  not be
obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm
except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and
then only after such firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such 
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants.

 

 

Section 1.10            _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) If the sum of (i) the difference between the Closing Adjusted Statutory
Capital set forth in the Final Statement _minus_   the amount of Estimated
Adjusted Regulatory Capital, _plus_ (ii) the difference between the Closing
Insolvency Protection Reserve Capital set forth in the Final Statement 
_minus_ the amount of Estimated Insolvency Regulatory Reserve Requirement,
_plus_ (iii) the  difference between the Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Final Statement _minus_ the amount of Estimated Net Working
Capital, _plus_ (iv) the difference between the Closing Net Asset Value set
forth in the Final Statement _minus_ the amount of Estimated Net  Asset
Value, _plus_ (v) the difference between the Closing Date Cash set forth in
the Final Statement _minus_   the amount of Estimated Closing Date Cash,
_plus_ (vi) the difference between the amount of Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness _minus_ the Closing Date Indebtedness set forth in the Final
Statement, _plus_ (vii) the difference between the amount of Estimated 
Seller Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Seller Transaction Expenses set forth
in the Final Statement equals (A) a positive amount, then the Purchaser shall
pay such amount  in cash to the Seller, or (B) a negative amount, then the
Seller shall pay the absolute value of such amount in cash to the Purchaser
(such amount, if any, that either the Purchaser is obligated to pay to the
Seller, or the Seller is  obligated to pay to the Purchaser, being herein
referred to as the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") or, in the Purchaser's sole
discretion, the Purchaser may satisfy such  amounts from the Escrow Funds.
Payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be made within five (5) Business
Days after the Final Statement becomes such.

(b) In the event that, following determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment,
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
actually collect any  portion of the Provider Advances Receivable that was
not included in the calculation of Closing Net Asset Value, the Purchaser
shall promptly remit such payment to the Seller.

 

 

Section 1.11            _Payments and Computations_. Except for the
payment of the Closing Payment (which shall be  paid at the Closing), each of
the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall make each payment due to the
party hereto not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day when
due as required by the terms of this Agreement. All  payments (including the
Closing Payment) shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated in advance by the party receiving such
payment. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this  Agreement shall bear
interest at a rate equal to the 3-month SOFR as of the date such payment was
due, taken from a widely accepted source of published interest rates, plus
8.0% (" _Late           Payment Interest_ "). All computations of
Late Payment Interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in
each case, for the actual number of days (including the first due day but
excluding the day of payment)  occurring in the period for which such Late
Payment Interest is payable. Whenever any payment under this Agreement shall
be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such  extension of time shall not be
included in the computation of, and payment of, Late Payment Interest.

 

 

Section 1.12 ___Withholding_. All payments under this Agreement shall be made
without deduction or withholding for  any Taxes, except as required by Law.
If any Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such
payment to any Person, then the Person required to make such deduction or
withholding shall be entitled to do so and shall timely  pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Entity in accordance with
Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that the Party required to make such deduction
or withholding shall provide each other Party that is subject to such
deduction or withholding with a written notice of its intention to deduct or
withhold at least five (5) Business Days prior  to any such deduction or
withholding and each of the applicable Parties shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate to minimize or eliminate any such withholding
obligation. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld  and
actually remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld and
remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

shall not limit (i) the Purchaser's right under Section  1.08 with respect to
any Assumed Liabilities taken into account in the determination of Closing Net
Asset Value or (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' rights to
indemnification to the extent that such Assumed Liability results in  a
breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller set forth in Section
3.01.

Section 2.04            _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in Section 2.03, and except as otherwise provided in

to, assign to the Purchaser, and the Assumed  Liabilities shall not, and
shall not be deemed to, include any of the following Liabilities of the Non-
MCC Entities, whether presently in existence or arising after the date of this
Agreement and, in each case, except as explicitly set forth  herein, whether
arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date (all such Liabilities, the "
_Excluded Liabilities_ "):

 

 

(a) all Liabilities to the extent relating to, or arising from, any Excluded
Assets;

 

 

(b) all Liabilities to the extent arising under or related to any Indebtedness
of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness included in the
Closing Date  Indebtedness);

Section 2.05            _Assignment of Certain Transferred Assets_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, convey, assign,
transfer or deliver to the  Purchaser any Transferred Asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an agreement to
do any of the foregoing, without the  consent, authorization or approval of a
third party (including any Governmental Entity), would constitute a breach or
other contravention thereof or a violation of Law (any such Transferred Asset,
claim, right or benefit, a " _Non-Assignable Asset_ "). From the date hereof
until the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any such  consent, authorization or
approval or any other consent, authorization or approval necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third parties (other than with respect to
Governmental Entities which are addressed under Section 4.04) in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event, prior to the Closing),
and  the Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate
with the Seller to obtain any such consent, authorization or approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall either Party or any of their
respective Affiliates be (i) required to pay any material cost or expense or
(ii) obligated to initiate any  Proceedings in connection with obtaining any
such consent, authorization or approval.

 

 

 

-16-  


 

 

(b) If, on the Closing Date, any such consent, authorization or approval is
not obtained (or any such consent, authorization or approval that was obtained
prior to the Closing  is no longer in full force and effect), or if an
attempted sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such
Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit would constitute a breach or other
contravention or a violation of Law, then  (i) such Non-Assignable Asset
shall not be Transferred to the Purchaser at the Closing, (ii) subject to the
immediately following _clause (iii)_ , the Purchaser shall not  be obligated
to assume, discharge or perform any Liability under or with respect to such
Non-Assignable Asset, and (iii) the Seller and the Purchaser will cooperate
and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain a mutually acceptable 
arrangement under which the Purchaser would, in compliance with Law, obtain
the benefits of, and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens
associated with, such Non-Assignable Asset in accordance with this Agreement
at a cost to  the Purchaser, not in excess of the cost the Purchaser would
have incurred if the requisite consent, authorization or approval had been
obtained prior to the Closing, including subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to the Purchaser, or  under which the Seller would (A) enforce for
the benefit (and at the expense) of the Purchaser and the Transferred Entities
any and all of its or their rights against a third party (including any
Governmental Entity) associated with such  Non-Assignable Asset, and (B)
promptly pay to the Purchaser (and/or its Affiliates), when received, all
monies received by it or them under any such Non-Assignable Asset (net of any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by  it or them
pursuant to clause (A) of this sentence), and the Purchaser and/or one or more
of its Subsidiaries would assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens
associated therewith.

 

 

(c) After the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Seller will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain all consents,
authorizations or approvals that have not  been obtained prior to the Closing
which are necessary for the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery
of any Non-Assignable Asset to the Purchaser, and the Seller shall provide or
cause to be provided all commercially reasonable  assistance requested by the
Purchaser in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that  in
no event shall either Party or any of their respective Affiliates be (i)
required to pay any material cost or expense or (ii) obligated to initiate any
Proceedings in connection with obtaining any such consent, authorization or
approval.  If all required consents, authorizations or approvals with respect
to any Non-Assignable Asset are obtained after the Closing Date, then, subject
to any restrictions under applicable Law, on the date the last such consent,
authorization or  approval is obtained (the " _Consent Achievement Date_ "):
(i) such Non-Assignable Asset shall be deemed to have been Transferred to the
Purchaser, and (ii) with respect to a  Non-Assignable Asset that would have
been a Transferred Contract or a Transferred Lease had such consents,
authorizations or approvals been obtained prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
shall assume as of the Consent Achievement Date and agree  to discharge and
perform as and when due, the ongoing obligations of the Seller under such
Contract, in each case in such manner consistent with Section 2.01. The
obligations  of the Seller and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and
the first sentence of this Section 2.05(c)  shall terminate with respect to a
particular Non-Assignable Asset upon the earlier of (A) the Consent
Achievement Date (in which event the applicable Non-Assignable Asset shall be
sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred or delivered to the  Purchaser in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) and (B) the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date.

(d) To the extent that any Leases or Contracts to which any Non-MCC Entity is
a party (i) exclusively relate to the MCC Business but are not listed on
Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter or (ii) do
not exclusively relate to the MCC Business but are listed  on Section 2.01(a)
or Section 2.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, promptly upon discovery of
any such  Lease or Contract, as applicable, the discovering party shall
notify the other party and promptly thereafter shall assign, or cause its
applicable Subsidiary to assign such Lease or Contract, as applicable, to the
other party.

 

 

Section 2.06 _Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and  warranties contained herein shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until fifteen (15)
months following the Closing Date whereupon they shall expire, and all claims
for breach of said representations and warranties  will be deemed waived;
_provided_ , _that_ , the Fundamental Representations and any representation
in  the case of Fraud shall survive for the full period of the applicable
statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days. All covenants and agreements
contained herein to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive until the
first (1st)  anniversary of the Closing and any covenants and agreements to
be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their terms. References in this Section  2.06 to the "statute of limitations"
shall refer to the statute of limitations applicable to the particular matter
that gave rise to a breach of the representation or warranty in question, and
not to the statute of limitations  applicable to a breach of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if written notice of a claim has been given
pursuant to Section 2.06(e) prior to the expiration date  of the applicable
survival period with respect to the applicable representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements by the Party seeking indemnification for such claim,
then such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements shall  survive
as to such claim until such claim has finally resolved pursuant to this
Section 2.06. The Parties specifically and unambiguously intend that the
survival periods that  are set forth in this Section 2.06 shall replace any
statute of limitations that would otherwise be applicable.

 

 

(b) _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations in this
Section 2.06, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives (each, a "
_Purchaser           Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and
all Losses actually suffered or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party
if and to the extent such Losses are suffered or incurred as a result of any
of the following:

 

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Seller
when made or deemed to be made under the terms hereof (unless specifically
provided otherwise);

 

 

(ii) the breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Seller or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities prior to the
Closing) under this Agreement,  other than the covenants and agreements under
Section 7.10, which shall be subject to the  indemnification provisions of
Section 7.10;

 

 

(iii) any and all DandO Costs of any director, officer, manager or general or
limited partner of any Transferred Entity relating to any threatened, pending
or completed action,  suit or Proceeding that is not primarily related to the
MCC Business solely to the extent not covered by the prepaid "tail" directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy contemplated by Section 4.07(d);

 

 

 

-18-  


 

 

(iv) any Indebtedness of the Transferred Entities which is outstanding as of
the Closing and which is not accounted for in the Post-Closing Adjustment;

 

 

(v) any Seller Transaction Expenses which are outstanding as of the Closing
and which are not accounted for in the Post-Closing Adjustment;

 

 

(vi) the Excluded Liabilities;

 

 

(vii) the failure by the Seller to pay Transfer Taxes to the extent provided
in Section 7.08; and

 

 

(viii) the matters set forth on Section 2.06(b)(viii) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

 

 

(c) _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations in this
Section 2.06, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall defend and hold
harmless the Seller, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives (each, a "
_Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party if and to the extent
such Losses are suffered or incurred as a result of any of  the following:

 

 

(i) The breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser when made or deemed to be made under the terms hereof (unless
specifically provided otherwise);

 

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser or the
Transferred Entities contained in this Agreement;

 

 

(iii) except to the extent subject to indemnification by the Seller or
adjustment in relation to the determination of the Closing Net Asset Value,
the Assumed Liabilities and any  Liabilities of any of the Transferred
Entities; and

 

 

(iv) the failure by the Purchaser to pay or reimburse Taxes to the extent
provided in Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(d), Section 7.06 and Section 7.08.

 

 

(d) _Certain Limitations and Recourse_.

 

 

(i) The Seller shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 2.06(b)(i)  until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification thereunder exceeds Three Million One
Hundred Eighty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,187,500) (the "
_Basket_ "),           in which event the Seller shall be liable for
all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 2.06(b)(i)  in excess
of the Basket up to the Escrow Amount.

 

 

 

-19-  


 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
sole and exclusive source of payment for Losses resulting or arising from
claims for  indemnification pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(i) for breaches of
representations and warranties (other than  Fundamental Representations) will
be sought only from the following sources and only in the following sequence:
(A) _first_ , from the Escrow Funds, (B) _second_ , after such Escrow Funds
have been entirely depleted or disbursed, from the RandW Policy to the full
extent of coverage available therefor under the RandW Policy  and (C) _third_ ,
after the full extent of coverage available under the RandW Policy has been
depleted or disbursed, the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for such 
Losses.

 

 

(iii) To the extent a Loss arises from actual Fraud, a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or a breach of a covenant, then the Purchaser may seek the
amount of such Loss  directly from the Seller subject to the other
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(iv) To the extent a Loss arises from a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.01(h),  notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Purchaser may seek the amount of such Loss (A) _first_ ,
from the Escrow Funds without regard to the Basket,  and (B) _second_ , after
such Escrow Funds have been entirely depleted or disbursed, from the RandW
Policy to the full extent of coverage available therefor under the  RandW
Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, following exhaustion of the Escrow Funds,
the Seller shall have no further liability for breaches of representations or
warranties contained in Section 3.01(h); _provided_ , _that_ , nothing in this
paragraph shall  limit the Seller's obligation to satisfy indemnification
obligations under Section 7.10 notwithstanding that an indemnification claim
thereunder could have been satisfied  through a claim for a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.01(h).

 

 

(e) _Notice and Defense of Claims_. All claims for indemnification under this
Section 2.06 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

 

(i) If a Third-Party Claim is asserted against the Seller Indemnified Parties
that is covered by Section 2.06(b)  or against the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties that is covered by Section 2.06(c) (such Party entitled to
indemnification with respect to the Third-Party Claims, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ " and each an " _Indemnified Party_ "), the Indemnified Party will
promptly give notice  describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") to the Seller or the Purchaser, as  applicable (such Party
required to provide indemnification, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of such
Third-Party Claim. Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an 
Indemnified Party with respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim to the extent that: (i) the
principal relief sought by such Third-Party  Claim is an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party (and solely to the extent the
Third-Party Claim relates to such injunction or equitable relief); or (ii)
involves, or could otherwise reasonably be expected to affect  any material
business relationship of a then-current customer of either the Seller or the
Purchaser. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within
(30) days after its receipt of a Claim Notice that it will conduct and 
control the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third-Party Claim and
any Action resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense (a " _Third-Party           Defense_ "). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the Third-Party Defense in accordance herewith: (A)
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense (as to which the Indemnified Party will not be  entitled to
indemnification, unless (1) the named parties to such proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would not be 
permitted under applicable standards of professional conduct or such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be one
or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not
available to such  Indemnifying Party, or if available to such Indemnifying
Party, the assertion of which would be adverse to or in conflict with the
interests of the Indemnified Party, or (2) if so requested to participate by
Indemnifying Party, and then in  each such case the reasonable expense of one
separate counsel for Indemnified Party shall be paid by Indemnifying Party, in
which case, the fees, costs and expenses of such counsel shall be
indemnifiable amounts hereunder) and participate in  the defense of the
Third-Party Claim but the Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof; (B) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense; and (C) the Indemnifying Party shall be  required
to keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of any and all matters
related to such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the Third-Party Defense within such thirty (30) day period, or the
Indemnifying  Party is not entitled to assume the Third-Party Defense in
accordance herewith, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to conduct and
control the Third-Party Defense, and such fees and costs shall be
indemnifiable Losses hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that (W) the
Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost  and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim but the
Indemnified Party shall control the investigation, defense and settlement,
subject to the provisions herein; and (X) the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate in good  faith in such defense. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 2.06(e)(i) to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnifying  Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (Y) settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim or (Z) permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  the provisions
of this Section 2.06(e) shall not apply to any Third-Party Claim related to
Taxes.

 

 

 

-20-  


 

 

(ii) _Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event the Indemnified Party has a claim
for indemnification hereunder  that does not involve a claim being asserted
against or sought to be collected by a Third Party (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly send a Claim  Notice with respect to such
Direct Claims to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 9.03. Each
such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of  such
Direct Claim, shall reference the provision or provisions of this Agreement
under which the Direct Claim is asserted and, if applicable, the applicable
sections of this Agreement which are alleged to have been breached by the 
Indemnifying Party and, to the extent reasonably estimable, shall set forth
the estimated Losses sought in such Direct Claim.

 

 

(iii) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice for a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days from the date the Indemnifying Party
receives the Claim Notice in  accordance with Section 2.06(e)(ii) to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party  and its Representatives
to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the  Indemnifying
Party's investigation by providing such information and assistance (including
reasonable access to premises and personnel of the Indemnified Party and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the 
Indemnifying Party or any of its Representatives may reasonably request. If
the Indemnifying Party does not respond to the Indemnified Party in writing
within such thirty (30) day period that the Indemnifying Party disputes such
Direct Claim,  the amount of such Direct Claim shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case the Indemnifying Party
shall timely object in writing to any Direct Claim made in accordance with
Section 2.06(e)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall have fifteen (15) days to
respond in a written statement to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If
after such fifteen (15) day  period there remains a dispute as to any Direct
Claim, the Parties shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree
upon the rights of the respective Parties with respect to such Direct Claim.
If the Parties should so agree, a  memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both Parties. If the Parties do not so agree,
the conflict shall be subject to resolution in accordance with
Section           9.08.

 

 

 

-21-  


 

 

(iv) _Notice of Claims_. The Indemnified Party's failure to give reasonably
prompt written notice to the  Indemnifying Party of any actual, threatened or
possible claim or demand that may give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have to the  Indemnified Party unless the failure to
give such written notice actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party or such
notice was given after the expiration of the applicable survival period under
Section 2.06(a).

 

 

(f) _Additional Limitations on Liability_.

 

 

(i) The Seller's aggregate Liability under Section 2.06(b) shall not exceed
the Purchase Price. For the  avoidance of doubt, the Seller's aggregate
Liability under Section 2.06(b)(i) (except for breaches of Fundamental
Representations) shall not exceed the Escrow Amount.

 

 

(ii) The limitations contained in this Section 2.06(f) shall in no way limit
the amounts the Purchaser  Indemnified Parties may recover directly under the
RandW Policy from the underwriter(s) of the RandW Policy.

 

 

(iii) After the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of which an
indemnification claim is properly made thereunder exceeds an amount equal to
the Basket plus the Escrow  Amount, the Purchaser shall have no further claim
for indemnification against the Seller under Section 2.06(b)(i) other than in
respect of a breach or inaccuracy of a  Fundamental Representation by the
Seller.

 

 

(iv) After the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of which an
indemnification claim is properly made thereunder exceeds an amount equal to
the Escrow Amount, prior to a  Purchaser Indemnified Party making a claim for
indemnification from the Seller under Section 2.06(b)(ii) - (b)(viii),  the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek recovery, at its or their own expense,
under all applicable insurance policies, including the RandW Policy, to the
extent  coverage for such matters exists on the face of the applicable
insurance policy, and indemnification or reimbursement rights covering any
such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required
to, and it shall not be required to cause any Transferred Entity to, initiate
or pursue any legal action to make any such  recovery; _provided_ , _further_
, that in no event shall the Purchaser's obligations under this  sentence act
as a bar to bringing an indemnification claim against the Seller. To the
extent that the Purchaser or any Transferred Entity receives any amount under
insurance coverage or other recovery with respect to a matter for which a 
Purchaser Indemnified Party has previously obtained payment in
indemnification, the Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt of such insurance proceeds or other recovery, pay and reimburse the
Seller, for any prior  indemnification payment up to the amount of the
insurance proceeds or other recovery, but less (A) the cost and expense of
pursuing such recovery, (B) any deductible associated therewith and (C) the
amount of any retro-premium obligations and  reasonably anticipated premium
increases resulting from such recovery (other than premiums under the RandW
Policy). For purposes of this Section 2.06(f), the term insurance  proceeds
shall in all respects include the proceeds received under or pursuant to the
RandW Policy.

 

 

 

-22-  


 

 

(v) The indemnification rights provided in this Section 2.06 constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the  Parties following the Closing and shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for any action (whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in
equity) that may be based on, arise out of  or relate to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Losses alleged to be
suffered by any Party as a result of the actions or failure  to act by any
Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than (A) claims based on Fraud, (B) the remedy of
specific performance or other equitable remedies provided by Section 9.10 with
respect to any covenant or agreement that survives the Closing in accordance
with Section 2.06(a)  or (C) as provided by Section 1.10 or Section 7.10. The
Seller has specifically relied upon the limited  remedies provided in this
Section 2.06 in agreeing to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement and
in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set forth
herein.

 

 

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Parties shall be liable to any Indemnified Party (whether in
contract or in tort or  otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity) for any punitive or exemplary damages that may be
based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter  of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the actions or failure to act by any Party
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(vii) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification with respect
to any Losses to the extent such Losses are accrued or otherwise reflected in
the calculation of the  Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with Section
1.10.

 

 

(viii) Any Losses indemnifiable under Section 2.06(b) or Section 2.06(c) shall
be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or  agreement in this Agreement.

 

 

(g) _Fraud_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Section 2.06 shall preclude any Party from making a claim for Fraud
against a Party that committed such Fraud or relieve any Party from any
Liability for Fraud committed by such  Party.

 

 

 

-23-  


 

 

(h) _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties agrees to use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate its  respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any fact, event, circumstance or condition that could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Losses indemnifiable under this
Section           2.06, including pursuing recovery for Losses under
the RandW Policy.

 

 

(i) ___Subrogation_. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights
of the Indemnified Party in  respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by
such party provided that such subrogation could not reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on the operations, affairs, customer or supplier
relationships or prospects of the MCC  Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that an Indemnifying Party's right to subrogation with respect to  insurance
carriers shall not be subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that an Indemnified Party's right to
subrogation shall at all times be limited by the terms of the RandW Policy to
the extent the RandW Policy specifically limits or restricts such right.

 

 

(j) _Right of Offset_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein,
from and after the Closing,  the Seller and the Purchaser may at any time
withhold and set off against amounts otherwise payable by the Seller or the
Purchaser, respectively, under the Transition Services Agreement or the
Commercial Agreements any amounts finally  determined in accordance herewith
(either by the written agreement of the Purchaser and the Seller or by a final
and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Section 9.08) to be payable by the Purchaser to the Seller Indemnified
Parties or by the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, respectively,
pursuant to any section of this Section 2.06.

 

 

(k) _Materiality; Net Losses; No Contributions_.

 

 

(i) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a Party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising out of or resulting from any breach
of a representation or  warranty contained herein, the representations and
warranties herein shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications
as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect". For purposes of determining
whether a breach of a  representation or warranty contained herein has
occurred, following the Purchaser Indemnified Parties suffering Losses which
equal or exceed the Basket and the Escrow Funds, but not prior thereto, the
representations and warranties contained  herein (other than the Fundamental
Representations) shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications
as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect".

 

 

(ii) The Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees that the Seller shall not
in its capacity as an equityholder exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise
or assert), any right  of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against any Transferred Entity in connection with any indemnification
or other rights any Party may have under or in connection with this Agreement.

forth in the corresponding sections or  subsections of the disclosure letter
delivered to the Purchaser by the Seller at the time of entering into this
Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being  understood that any
disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to, and shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to  which
it corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this
Agreement to the extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect
to such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of
such  disclosure), the Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser
as set forth below. For purposes of this Article III, any reference to the MCC
Business shall include the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Seller
Parties and Transferred Entities  is a legal entity duly organized, validly

incorporation, formation or organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate  its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to
do business and is in good standing as a foreign legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or 
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has made
available to the Purchaser complete and correct copies of its Organizational
Documents of the Seller and each Transferred Entities as amended and as in

Organizational Documents in any material respect.

Interests. All of the Transferred Equity Interests have been duly  authorized
and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights. The Transferred Equity Interests represent
all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Transferred 
Entities. The owners, beneficially and of record, of all of the Transferred
Equity Interests are as shown on Section 3.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, and such owners  hold such Transferred Equity Interests free and
clear of all Liens, except any Lien arising out of, or in connection with this

securities Laws. There are no options,  warrants or rights of conversion or
other similar rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating any
Transferred Entity to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock, other
equity interests or securities convertible into or  exchangeable for its
shares or other equity interests, other than as provided in this Agreement.
There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of the 
Transferred Equity Interests, other than as provided for in this Agreement.

 

 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval_. The Seller has all requisite corporate
power and authority and has  taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the  Seller, enforceable against the Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No
approval by the stockholders of the Seller is required in order for the Seller
to execute, deliver and perform its  obligations under this Agreement or to

and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements), except, in each case, those that
the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or  in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Seller
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, constitute or result  in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default
under, Seller's or its Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents or the
comparable governing instruments of any Transferred Entity, (B) with or

reports,  consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting
periods and authorizations referred to in Section 3.02(c) are made or obtained

Government Program Contract in any material respect. To the Knowledge of the

time or  both, be a breach or default in any material respect or give rise to
a termination right under any Government Program Contract. None of the Non-MCC
Entities (solely with respect to the MCC Business) or any Transferred Entities
have received  written or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, oral notice of (1)
any actual or alleged breach in any material respect by any Non-MCC Entity
(solely with respect to the MCC Business) or a Transferred Entity of any

(t) _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be likely to be, individually
or in the aggregate,  materially adverse to the Non-MCC Entities (solely with
respect to the MCC Business) or the Transferred Entities, all insurance
policies of the Non-MCC Entities (solely with respect to the MCC Business) and
the Transferred Entities relating  to the business, assets and operations of
the MCC Business are (i) valid, binding, in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, (ii) sufficient to comply with applicable Law and
provide insurance in such amounts and against such  risks as the Seller
reasonably has determined to be prudent, and (iii) not and have not been
subject to any lapse in coverage, and all premiums due and payable thereon
have been paid in full when due no notice of cancellation or modification 
has been received by the Seller or its Affiliates, and there is no existing
default or event which would constitute a default by any insured thereunder.
To the Knowledge of the Seller and subject to the applicable carrier's
reservation of  rights, there are no claims related to the MCC Business
pending under any insurance policy as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed. Except as would not reasonably be likely to be,
individually or in the aggregate,  materially adverse to the Non-MCC Entities

claims, occurrences and circumstances that could lead to a Proceeding that
would be covered by any insurance policy have  been properly reported to and
accepted by the applicable insurer as required under the policy terms.

arrangements in the Ordinary  Course of Business, there are no Contracts,
transactions, arrangements or understandings between the Seller or any of the

of the Seller, on the other hand, that would be required to be disclosed
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC in the Seller's
Form 10-K or proxy statement pertaining to an annual meeting of 
stockholders.

 

 

(v) _Material Customers_. No Non-MCC Entity (with respect to the MCC Business)
nor any Transferred Entity  is, as of the date hereof, engaged in any
material dispute with any Material Customer that, to the Knowledge of the
Seller, would be reasonably likely to lead such Material Customer to terminate
or materially decrease its relationship with  any Non-MCC Entity (with
respect to the MCC Business) or any Transferred Entity. No Non-MCC Entity
(with respect to the MCC Business) nor any Transferred Entity has received any
written notice or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, any oral  notice from any
Material Customer expressly stating any intention or threat to terminate or to
change any material commercial terms under any Contract with, any Non-MCC
Entity (with respect to the MCC Business) or any Transferred Entity.

(w) _Material Vendors_. No Non-MCC Entity (with respect to the MCC Business)
nor any Transferred Entity is  engaged in any material dispute with any
Material Vendor that, to the Knowledge of the Seller, would be reasonably
likely to lead such Material Vendor to terminate or materially decrease its
relationship with any Non-MCC Entity (with respect  to the MCC Business) or
any Transferred Entity. No Non-MCC Entity (with respect to the MCC Business)
nor any Transferred Entity has received any written notice or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, any oral notice from any Material Vendor  expressly
stating any intention or threat to terminate or materially reduce its
provision of goods or services to, or to change any material commercial terms

direct material liabilities or obligations to any third parties.

Parties or any of the Transferred Entities or their respective businesses or
with respect to any other information made available to the Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any  such information made available to the Purchaser in the "Project

3.01, the Seller hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility for all
projections, forecasts, estimates, financial statements, financial
information, appraisals, statements, promises,  advice, data or information
made, communicated or furnished (orally or in writing, including

Section 3.02          _Representations and Warranties of the
Purchaser_. Except as set forth in the corresponding  sections or subsections
of the disclosure letter delivered to the Seller by the Purchaser at the time
of entering into this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Letter_ ")  (it
being understood that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of
the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to,
and shall be deemed to apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of
this  Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent the qualifying nature of such
disclosure with respect to such other section or subsection is reasonably
apparent on the face of  such disclosure), the Purchaser hereby represents
and warrants to the Seller as follows:

 

 

(a) ___Organization, Good Standing, Qualification_. The Purchaser is a legal
entity duly organized, validly  existing and in good standing under the Laws
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is qualified  to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be  so organized,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) _Corporate Authority; Approval_. The Purchaser has all requisite corporate
power and authority and has  taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the  Purchaser and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No
approval by the stockholders of the Purchaser is  required in order for the
Purchaser to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

 

(i) Other than the necessary filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods or
authorizations required (A) under the HSR  Act in connection with this
Agreement, (B) set forth on Section 3.02(c)(i) _(B)_ of the Purchaser 
Disclosure Letter or (C) required under the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act, no filings, notices and/or reports are required to be made by the
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits,  expirations of waiting periods or authorizations
required to be obtained by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Purchaser and/or  the consummation by the Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, those that the
failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Purchaser does not, and the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not,  constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of the
Purchaser, (B) with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, a breach or violation of, a default or termination  or modification (or
right of termination or modification) under, payment of additional fees under,
the creation or acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a
Lien on any of the assets of the Purchaser or any of its  Subsidiaries
pursuant to any material Contract binding upon the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) the
filings,  notices, reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
expirations of waiting periods and authorizations referred to in Section
3.02(c)(i) are made or obtained, under  any Law, Order or License to which
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the
rights or obligations under any material Contract to which the Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the  case of _clauses (B)_ and
_(C)_ above, for any such breach, violation, default, termination, 
modification, payment, acceleration, creation or change that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

-46-  


 

 

(d) _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened in  writing against the Purchaser that seeks to enjoin,
or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or making
illegal, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(e) _Securities Matters_. The Transferred Equity Interests are being acquired
by the Purchaser for its own  account, and not with a view to, or for the
offer or sale in connection with, any public distribution or sale of the
Transferred Equity Interests or any interest in them. The Purchaser (either
alone or with its advisors) has sufficient  knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Transferred Equity Interests, and the Purchaser
is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment,  including a
complete loss of its investment in the Transferred Equity Interests. The
Purchaser acknowledges that the Transferred Equity Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act, or any other applicable state, foreign
or  federal securities Laws, and understands and agrees that it may not sell
or dispose of any of the Transferred Equity Interests except pursuant to a
registered offering in compliance with, or in a transaction exempt from, the
registration  requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable
state, foreign or federal securities Laws.

 

 

(f) _Financial Ability_. The Purchaser has, and will have at the Closing, (A)
the resources and  capabilities (financial and otherwise) to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (including all payments to be made by it in
connection herewith) and (B) immediately available funds in an aggregate
amount that will enable the Purchaser  to (1) consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and (2) pay
all related fees and expenses and undertake its other obligations at Closing
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement. The  Purchaser has not
incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any
kind, and is not contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment,
restriction or other liability of any kind, in either case which would
impair  or adversely affect such resources, funds or capabilities.

 

 

(g) _Brokers and Finders_. The Purchaser has not employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability  for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders'
fees in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, except that the Purchaser has employed Barclays Capital Inc.
as its financial advisor and Marsh Risk  and Insurance Services as its broker
for the RandW Policy.

 

 

(h) ___Solvency_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the truth and accuracy of  the representations and warranties of
the Seller set forth in Section 3.01, immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (including
any financings being entered into in connection therewith):

 

 

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of the Purchaser will be greater than the total amount of its
Liabilities (including all  Liabilities whether direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

 

 

 

-47-  


 

 

(ii) the Purchaser will be able to pay its debts and obligations in the
ordinary course of business as they become due; and

(i) _Inspections; No Other Seller Representations and Warranties_. The
Purchaser is an informed and  sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert
advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of businesses such as its
acquisition of the MCC Business as contemplated hereunder. The Purchaser has
undertaken such investigation and has  evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement. The Purchaser agrees to accept the  Transferred Entities,
the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the MCC Business without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature made by the Seller or any of its directors, officers,  employees,
stockholders, partners, members, advisors or other Representatives, except as
specifically and expressly set forth in Section 3.01. Further, the Purchaser 
acknowledges, that the Seller shall have no liability and responsibility for
the projections, forecasts, estimates, financial statements, financial
information, appraisals, statements, promises, advice, data or information
made, communicated  or furnished (orally or in writing, including
electronically) to the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Affiliates or any
Representatives of the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Affiliates,
including omissions therefrom. Without limiting  the foregoing, the Purchaser
also acknowledges that the Seller makes no representation or warranty of any
kind whatsoever, express or implied, written or oral, at law or in equity, to
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any  Representatives of the
Purchaser of any of its Affiliates regarding the success, profitability or
value of the MCC Business.

Section 4.02 ___Access; Consultation_.

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Transferred Entities to,
afford the Purchaser and  its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to the MCC
Business employees, properties, assets, books, records and Contracts and,
during such period, the Seller shall, and shall  cause its Transferred
Entities to, furnish promptly to the Purchaser and its Representatives all
information concerning the MCC Business' capital stock, business and personnel
as may reasonably be requested by the Purchaser and its  Representatives in
connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , no investigation
pursuant to  this Section 4.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Seller; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
the foregoing shall not require the Seller to permit any invasive
environmental sampling or any inspection or to disclose any information
pursuant to this Section 4.02(a), to the extent that (i) in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Seller, any applicable Law requires the Seller or
its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit  access to any such properties or
information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Seller, the
information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or
(iii) disclosure of any such information or document would  result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege; and _provided_ , _further_ that with
respect to _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ of this Section  4.02(a), the Seller
shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (A) obtain the required
consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (B)
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to  address such
matters that is reasonably acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser and (C)
in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(iii)_ , implement appropriate and mutually
agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to
remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate
clean  room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense
agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties
determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without  violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.
Any investigation pursuant to this Section 4.02(a) shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere  unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of the other party. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
4.02(a) shall be directed to an executive officer  of the Seller or such
Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.

 

 

(b) The Seller, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the Purchaser or its
Representatives as "Outside  Counsel Only Material" or with similar
restrictions. Such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the
restriction indicates, and shall be subject to any  additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All
information exchanged pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) shall be subject to the
Confidentiality  Agreements. To the extent that any of the information or
material furnished pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) or otherwise in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement may  include material subject to the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they  have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire,
intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of  such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such
information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product  doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain
entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under
the joint defense doctrine. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser
shall identify to the Purchaser  any actions or practices of the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under applicable Law
and, to the extent identified, shall, subject to the Purchaser's prior written
consent, take commercially reasonable actions  or practices and other
customary actions to reduce the risks related to such actions where the
failure to remediate would reasonably be likely to result in substantial fines
or penalties.

 

 

 

-52-  


 

 

(c) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall give prompt notice to one
another of any change, effect, circumstance or development that would
reasonably be likely to result in  a Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any reasonably likely failure
of any condition to the Purchaser's or the Seller's obligations to effect the
Closing (as applicable).

 

 

Section 4.03          _Post-Closing Access to Information_. Subject to
Section 7.03(a), for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, each of the

Representatives access to the Books and Records and the  books and records of
the Transferred Entities (collectively, the " _Accessible Information_ ")
transferred to the Purchaser or retained by the Seller, as applicable (even
if  any Accessible Information is or becomes commingled with books and
records of the Purchaser or the Seller and their respective Affiliates), and
the properties, personnel and Representatives of each Party, as may be
reasonably required by the  requesting Party or such Party's Affiliates,
including to the extent necessary for the preparation of financial statements
or regulatory filings in respect of periods ending on or prior to the Closing,
or in connection with any insurance  claims, Proceedings or any obligations
under this Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby. At the requesting Party's cost and expense, the requesting
Party and its Affiliates and its and their  respective Representatives shall
be entitled to make copies of any Accessible Information to which such Persons
are entitled to access pursuant to this Section 4.03. Any such  access shall
be conducted during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice and
under reasonable circumstances, and shall be subject to restrictions under Law
and any confidentiality obligations to which the Parties are bound.   Except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.03(a), each Party shall preserve and keep
the Accessible Information held by such Party or any of its Affiliates for a
period of six  (6) years following the Closing Date. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, (i) keep all information
accessed pursuant to this Section 4.03  confidential, (ii) not publicly
disclose such information to any other Person (except where such disclosure,
upon the advice of outside counsel, is required by Law and only to the extent
required by applicable Law); _provided_ , _that_ , each Party or its 
Affiliates may disclose such information to its Representatives or other
Persons that have a duty of confidentiality (or similar duty or obligation of
non-disclosure) to such disclosing Party, and (iii) not use such information
other than for  the express purposes set forth in this Section 4.03.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise provided in Section
7.03(a), any and all such Accessible Information may be destroyed by the
Parties after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or such later
date as required by applicable Law).

Cooperation_.

 

 

(a) Subject to the other terms of this Section 4.04, the Seller and the

Agreement or such other date as the Parties may  agree, in the case of all
other filings required under any Health Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby), and (F) as promptly as practicable and
advisable, but in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days  after the
date of this Agreement or such other date as the Parties may agree and to

(b) Subject to Section 4.04(d), in the event that the Parties receive a
request for information or documentary  material pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Laws, including a request for additional information (a "
_Second Request_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by the  Seller and the
Purchaser, the Parties will use their best efforts to submit an appropriate
response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request as promptly
as practicable and advisable, and counsel for both Parties will closely 
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. None
of the Parties, including their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless otherwise agreed
to by the Parties. None of the Parties, without the other Party's prior
written consent, shall  (i) enter into any timing, settlement or similar

expiration or termination of the waiting  period applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws, or
(ii) enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit
to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the Parties not  to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby (or that would otherwise prevent or
prohibit the Parties from consummating such contemplated transactions).

(c) To the extent permitted by Law, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, as
promptly as practicable, (i) upon any reasonable request from a Governmental
Entity, furnish to such  Governmental Entity, any information or
documentation concerning themselves, their Affiliates, directors, officers and
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, information or documentation

may be requested and (ii) make available their respective Representatives to
any Governmental Entity, in connection with (A) the preparation of any filing
made by or on their behalf to any Governmental Entity in  connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or (B) any Governmental Entity investigation,
review or approval process.

 

 

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust
Laws and Health Regulatory Laws related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and  shall have joint decision making authority with respect
to the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any
Governmental Entity required to  consummate the Closing prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _that_ , the Purchaser shall have  principal
responsibility for directing, devising, and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary approval of, for responding to any request from,
inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the timing, nature, and 
substance of all such responses), and for leading all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity. No Party hereto or its counsel
shall independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to
the Antitrust Laws  or Health Regulatory Laws with any Governmental Entity in
respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving
the other Party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and the
opportunity to attend and  participate, in each case, to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Entity or applicable Law. In furtherance of the foregoing
and to the extent permitted by any Governmental Entity or applicable Law, each
Party shall, with respect to the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(i) notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or
material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries
intends to make with any Governmental Entity  relating to the matters that
are the subject of this Section 4.04, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing
or making any such communication or inquiry, provide the other Party  and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith
the comments of the other Party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of such
filing or  making such communication or inquiry, provide the other Party with
a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry and
(iv) consult with the other Party in connection with any inquiry, hearing,
investigation or  litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental
Entity relating to this Agreement, including the scheduling of, and strategic
planning for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In
exercising the foregoing  cooperation rights, the Seller and the Purchaser
each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this Section
4.04 may be reasonably redacted as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns. Further, each Party may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive  material provided to the
other under this Section 4.04 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal 
counsel of the other Party, and each Party shall cause their outside counsel
not to disclose such materials or information to any employees, officers,
directors or other representatives of, respectively, the Seller or the
Purchaser, unless  express written permission is obtained in advance from the
other Party.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 4.04, each  of the parties, including their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, hereto shall use its best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable  Antitrust Laws or
Health Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any  suit
or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Section 4.04, "best  efforts" shall include taking any and all actions (such
actions, the " _Regulatory Actions_ ") necessary to obtain the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period  expirations or authorizations of any
Governmental Entity required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the
Termination Date, including (i) proposing,  negotiating, committing to,
effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate, and other
disposition of businesses, assets, products or equity interests,  (ii)
creating, terminating, or amending any existing relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to
any action that would limit the freedom of action with respect to the
operation of, or  ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any
businesses, assets, products or equity interests; _provided_ , _that_ , such
Regulatory Actions are conditioned upon and become effective only from and
after the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
Purchaser be required to take or agree to offer or take, and the Seller shall
not take or agree or offer to take, any Regulatory Action  that, individually
or in the aggregate, would (A) require the sale, divestiture, license, hold
separate, or other disposition of the businesses, assets, products or equity
interests of the MCC Business, to the extent such action would have  resulted
in more than a 15% reduction in the MCC Business' revenues for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2019, or (B) (1) require the sale, divestiture, license,
hold separate, or other disposition of the businesses, assets, products or 
equity interests of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, now owned or hereafter
acquired (not including any businesses, assets, products or equity interests
of the MCC Business) or (2) otherwise result in a change or impairment to
the  Purchaser's business to the extent, in the case of (1) or (2), any such
action would be more than de minimis in nature to the Purchaser and its 
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged
and agreed that the Purchaser will be required to take and/or agree to any
Regulatory Actions with respect to the maintenance or increase of capital or
reserves at  any of the Transferred Entities (including any related
restrictions on declaring dividends and/or making distributions) at or
following the Closing without regard to the dollar limitation set forth in the
preceding sentence.

 

 

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 4.04, if any  administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law or  Health Regulatory Laws, each
of the Seller and the Purchaser shall use best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,  whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Closing.

 

 

(g) _Information_. The Seller and the Purchaser each shall, upon request by
the other, promptly furnish  the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
other statement, filing, notice or application  made by or on behalf of the
Purchaser, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

-56-  


 

 

(h) _Status_. The Seller and the Purchaser each shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of  matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other communications received by the Seller or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, or any of their  respective Subsidiaries from
any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.

 

 

Section 4.05          ___Publicity_. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall consult with each other prior to  issuing or making, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment on, any press releases or other
public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any filings with any third party or any  Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange) with respect thereto and none of
the Parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or public
announcement prior to obtaining the other Parties' consent (which  consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent
for any press release, public announcement or filing shall be required to the
extent (i) required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing  agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or the
NASDAQ or NYSE national securities exchange or (ii) such press release or
public statement in the good faith judgment of the applicable Party is
consistent with prior press  releases issued or public statements made in
compliance with this Section 4.05.

 

 

Section 4.06   _Expenses_. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement,
including Article VI, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
Party incurring such fees, costs or  expenses, whether or not the Closing
occurs. Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision in this
Agreement, (i) the Seller and the Purchaser shall each be responsible for, and
pay, fifty percent (50%) of the fees incurred in  connection with the filings
required under the HSR Act, and (ii) the Purchaser will be responsible for,
and pay, one hundred percent (100%) of the fees incurred in connection with
the filings required under the Health Regulatory Laws.

Section 4.07          _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until six (6) years from the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall or shall cause each Transferred Entity to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless  to the fullest extent permitted under Law, the
individuals or entities who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors,
officers, managers or general or limited partners of any Transferred Entities
with respect to all DandO Expenses and  all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
Taxes, interest, fines, judgements or amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, " _D andO Costs_") related to any threatened,  pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding arising out of any acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of such Transferred
Entity at any time on or prior to the Closing Date against all expenses 
(including attorneys' fees) by such individual or entity in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in any such
action,  suit or proceeding (collectively, " _D andO Expenses_"). In addition,
the Purchaser shall or shall cause each Transferred Entity to pay or reimburse
any DandO Expenses  of any officers, directors or general or limited partners
entitled to indemnification hereunder in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the  person or entity to whom DandO Expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required
by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The Organizational Documents of each of the Transferred Entities shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Closing Date in  any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals or entities who at or at any time prior to the
Closing Date were directors, officers, managers, general or limited partners,
agents or employees of such Transferred  Entity or otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable Law or such Transferred Entity's
Organizational Documents.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 4.07 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by,  each Person entitled to indemnification under
this Section 4.07, his, her, or its heirs or successors in interest (as
applicable) and his, her or its Representatives (as  applicable) and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall purchase and maintain in effect
beginning at the Closing Date and pay for a period of six (6) years thereafter
without any lapses  in coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who
are covered by any Transferred Entity's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies as of the date  hereof or at the Closing Date with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date. Such policy shall provide
coverage that is at least equal to the coverage provided under the Transferred
Entities' current director's and officer's  liability insurance policies.

 

 

 

-58-  


 

 

Section 4.08          _Seller Names and Marks_.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 4.08, from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall not use, or  permit any of its Affiliates to use, any of the
Seller Names and Marks in the operation or ownership of the Transferred Assets
or Transferred Entities (including the MCC Business) and the Purchaser shall,
as soon as practicable, and in any  event within three (3) months following
the Closing Date, remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all of the
Seller Names and Marks from all materials, including signage, vehicles,
facilities, business cards, schedules, stationery,  packaging materials,
displays, promotional materials, manuals, forms, software or other materials;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the Seller shall extend such time period for
up to an additional thirty (30) days upon the reasonable request of the
Purchaser. However, for clarity,  the foregoing sentence does not require the
Purchaser or its Affiliates to remove any the Seller Names and Marks solely to
the extent they are included as of the Closing Date in any source code,
internal programmer help files, internal build  materials, or internal
product development materials included in the Transferred Assets to the extent
not publicly displayed. Furthermore, without limiting either Party's
obligations regarding confidentiality, public statements or other  matters
under this Agreement, this Section 4.08 shall not be construed to prohibit the
Purchaser or its Affiliates from referring to the Seller Names and Marks in
factual  descriptions of the Seller's prior ownership of the MCC Business for
historical or informational purposes, _provided_ , _that_ , such marks are not
used as a Trademark. From and after the Closing until such removal occurs (and
in any event no later three (3) months following the Closing Date, subject to
extension), subject to  the terms and conditions hereof, the Seller hereby
grants the Purchaser and its Affiliates a limited, personal, non-assignable
and non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Seller Names and Marks
used in the MCC Business solely in  connection with transitioning to new
names and marks in accordance with this Section 4.08. Any use by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates of any of the Seller Names and  Marks used in the
MCC Business as permitted in this Section 4.08 is subject to their use of such
Seller Names and Marks in a form and manner, and with standards of quality,
of  that in effect for the Seller Names and Marks as used in the MCC Business
as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not use such
Seller Names and Marks in a manner that may reflect negatively on such name
and marks or on  the Seller or its Affiliates.

 

 

(b) The license granted under this Section 4.08 may be terminated by written
notice if the Purchaser or any of  its Affiliates materially breaches this
Section 4.08 and does not cure such breach within ten (10) days after written
notice thereof from the Seller. Upon such termination of  the license granted
hereunder, and in any event upon the date that is six (6) months after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not use, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to use, any of the Seller Names and Marks.

 

 

Section 4.09          _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, (i) the
Transferred Entities, the MCC Business,  the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, and the operations, assets and Liabilities in respect
thereof, shall cease to be insured by any of the Seller's or its Affiliates'
insurance policies or by any of their self-insured  programs, and (ii)
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Transferred Entities) shall have any access, right, title or
interest in or to any such insurance policies or self-insured programs 
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
to cover the MCC Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities,
or the operations, assets or Liabilities in respect thereof. From and after
the  Closing, the Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all insurance
it considers appropriate for the MCC Business, the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, and the operations, assets and Liabilities in respect
thereof.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent recovery is
permissible on the face of the Seller's insurance policies, the Seller agrees
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the Purchaser to seek
recovery under the Seller's  insurance policies for the benefit of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Transferred Entities) for Losses incurred by the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, a  Transferred Entity) following the
Closing in accordance with the Purchaser's subrogation rights under Section
2.06; _provided_ ,  _that_ , such cooperation shall be further limited to
matters that the Seller reported under its insurance policies prior to the
Closing, that were subsequently accepted by  the insurance carrier(s), and
for which coverage is not available to the Transferred Entities under similar
policies or programs which have been obtained by the Purchaser.

Section 4.10          _Post-Closing Transfers_.

 

 

(a) If at any time following the Closing, any Party (or any Affiliate of such
Party) shall receive or otherwise possess any asset or Liability that is
allocated to the other  Party pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) (the "
_Transferor Party_ ") reasonably promptly transfer, or  cause to be
transferred, such asset (each, a " _Non-Transferred Asset_ ") or liability
(each, a " _Non-Transferred  Liability_ "), as the case may be, to the other
Party (or to such Party's Affiliate) (the " _Transferee Party_ ") entitled to
such Non-Transferred Asset or  responsible for such Non-Transferred
Liability, as the case may be, and the Transferee Party entitled to such Non-
Transferred Asset or responsible for such Non-Transferred Liability shall
accept such Non-Transferred Asset or accept, assume  and agree faithfully to
perform or discharge such Non-Transferred Liability, as applicable. If any
transfer or assignment of any Non-Transferred Asset under this Section 4.10 
is unable to be consummated promptly for any reason, then, insofar as
reasonably possible, the Transferor Party retaining such Non-Transferred Asset
shall thereafter hold such Non-Transferred Asset for the use and benefit of
the Transferee  Party entitled thereto. In addition, the Transferor Party
retaining such Non-Transferred Asset shall, insofar as reasonably possible and
to the extent permitted by Law, take such actions as may be reasonably
requested by the Transferee Party  to whom such Non-Transferred Asset is to
be transferred or assigned, in order to place such Transferee Party in a
substantially similar position as if such Non-Transferred Asset had been
transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the  benefits and burdens
relating to such Non-Transferred Asset, including use, risk of loss, Tax
costs, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Non-
Transferred Asset, is to inure from and after the Closing to the  Transferee
Party. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with any
such transfers or assignments of Non-Transferred Assets or assumption of Non-
Transferred Liabilities, including reasonable attorneys' fees and all 
recording or similar fees, shall be borne by the Party that would have been
responsible for such costs and expenses if the transfer, assignment or
assumption had occurred at or prior to the Closing. This Section 4.10 shall
not apply with respect to any Non-Assignable Asset.

 

 

(b) At the request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to electronically transfer any of the Transferred Assets
(including any software) that can  be transmitted electronically, without
incurring additional cost and expense or any disruption or interference to the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, to the Purchaser promptly following the
Closing. If the Purchaser is able to  electronically transfer any such
Transferred Assets following a request from the Purchaser, the Seller shall
not deliver, and shall ensure that none of the Seller's Subsidiaries or any of
its or their respective Representatives delivers, any  such Transferred Asset
to the Purchaser on any tangible medium.

 

 

Section 4.11          _No Financing Contingencies_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that neither the obtaining  nor the availability or
funding of any financing shall constitute a condition to the Purchaser's
obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby.

 

 

 

-60-  


 

 

Section 4.12          _Shared Contracts_. With respect to the Shared
Contracts, the Seller, the Purchaser and  their respective Affiliates shall
be entitled to continue to derive benefits, and required to assume any
obligations and economic burdens attributable to such benefits, following the
Closing in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.12. From the date
hereof until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the
Parties and their Affiliates shall use their Commercially Reasonable  Efforts
to enter into or to grant, and to cause each third party counterparty to a
Shared Contract to enter into or to grant, any such new agreements or consents
as are reasonably necessary to permit the Seller and its Affiliates or the 
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to derive
such benefits, and assume such obligations and economic burdens, on an
independent basis following the Closing; _provided_ , _that_ , none of the
Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to offer or grant any  financial or nonfinancial accommodation in connection
therewith that the granting Party in its reasonable judgement determines would
be material. If, on the Closing Date, any such third party agreement or
consent is not obtained, the Seller  and the Purchaser shall cooperate in a
mutually acceptable arrangement under which the Seller and its Affiliates or
the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) would,
in compliance with Law, obtain the appropriate  benefits and assume the
related obligations and bear the related economic burdens in respect of such
Shared Contracts, including by means of subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangements, or enforcement by the party to such Shared  Contract
for the benefit (and at the expense) of the other Party or any of its
Affiliates (as applicable) that is an intended beneficiary thereof pursuant to
this Section 4.12.

 

 

Section 4.13          _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_. Except for
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or  as set forth on Section 4.13 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, at or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall
terminate, or cause to be terminated, all Affiliate Contracts and  shall
cause each Transferred Entity to be released from all covenants, agreements,
liabilities and obligations under such Affiliate Contracts, whether arising
prior to, at or after the Closing, in each case, to be effective at or prior
to the  Closing; _provided_ , _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no such
releases shall be effective with  respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or any Affiliate Contract set forth on Section 4.13 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

 

 

Section 4.14          _Intercompany Arrangements_.

 

 

(a) All intercompany (payables and receivables) accounts between the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities), on the one hand,
and any Non-RBC  Entity, on the other hand, shall be settled by means of a
deemed distribution (in the case of any net receivable held by any such
Transferred Entity) or a deemed contribution (in the case of any net payable
held by any such Transferred  Entity) to or from such entity's parent without
the need for any further documentation, immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

(b) All intercompany (payables and receivables) accounts between the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), on the one
hand, and any RBC  Entity, on the other hand, shall be settled in accordance
with the Reference Adjusted Statutory Capital Schedule.

 

 

(c) All intercompany (payables and receivables) accounts between the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Entities), on the one
hand, and SWH MA, on the  other hand, shall be settled in accordance with the
Insolvency Protection Reserve Requirement Capital Schedule.

 

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the actions contemplated by this

_MCC of Virginia_ ") under this Agreement as an "applicable asset acquisition"
of the assets of MCC of Virginia within the meaning of Section  1060 of the
Code (and similar provisions of state and local Law) and neither the Seller
nor the Purchaser shall, nor shall they permit their respective Affiliates to,
file any Tax Return or other document with, or make any statement or 
declaration to, any Taxing Authority that is inconsistent with such treatment,
except (x) pursuant to Section 7.07(d) with respect to the Section 338(h)(10)
Election with  respect to the Transferred Equity Interests of MCC of

timely remitted, all Taxes shown as due on all such Income Tax Returns. If any

Entities) or the Transferred Entities in any Post-Closing Tax Period, the
Seller shall provide to the  Purchaser a copy of such Tax Return or an
applicable pro forma statement (and any other information in the possession of

Period of such Tax Return) for the Purchaser's review, and the Seller shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by the  Purchaser with
respect to such Tax Return or pro forma statements within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt thereof. The Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely
filed all such non-Income Tax Returns referred to in clause (ii) above  that
are due to be filed by the Transferred Entities following the Closing within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of such Tax Returns from the Seller. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall reconcile amounts paid by the Purchaser
pursuant to  this Section 7.02(a) every six (6) months commencing on the
first six (6)-month anniversary of the Closing Date and continuing thereafter
until six (6) months following the  filing of the last non-Income Tax Return
pursuant to this Section 7.02. In the event the amount of non-Income Taxes
that are accrued or otherwise reflected in the calculation  of the Post-
Closing Adjustment in accordance with Section 1.10 exceeds the cumulative
amount remitted by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall promptly pay such excess
to the  Seller. If the cumulative amount remitted exceeds the amount of non-
Income Taxes that are accrued or otherwise reflected in the calculation of the
Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with Section 1.10, the Seller shall
promptly pay such excess to the Purchaser.

Seller to facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax  Returns described
in Section 7.02(a), if the Seller does not otherwise have access to the
underlying books and records necessary to prepare such information.

 

 

(c) For purposes of apportioning Taxes in connection with any Straddle Period,
(i) in the case of Taxes based upon or related to income, payroll, sales,
premiums or receipts,  the amount of any such Taxes allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, and (ii) in the case of  Taxes other than Taxes described in clause
(i), the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be the product of (x) the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period and (y) a fraction  the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period.

 

 

(d) The Purchaser, at the Purchaser's sole expense, shall prepare and timely
file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Straddle Period Tax
Returns of the  Transferred Entities and all Straddle Period Tax Returns
relating solely to the Transferred Assets (other than those filed by the
Seller pursuant to Section 7.02(a)) and shall  timely remit, or cause to be
timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Not later than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extensions validly obtained) for the filing of any Tax  Return required to be
filed by the Purchaser under this Section 7.02(d), the Purchaser shall provide
to the Seller a copy of such Tax Return or an applicable pro forma  statement
(and any other information in the possession of the Purchaser reasonably
requested by the Seller relevant for determining the amount of any Pre-Closing
Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, if any) for the Seller's review, and
the  Purchaser shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by
the Seller with respect to such Tax Return or pro forma statement within ten
(10) Business Days of receipt thereof. Not later than three (3) Business Days
before the due  date for the payment of Taxes shown as due on any such Tax
Returns, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such Taxes,
if any, reflected on the pro forma statements (as revised to reflect the
Seller's reasonable comments to  the extent described above), less the amount
of any such non-Income Taxes that are accrued or otherwise reflected in the
calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with
Section           1.10. In the event the amount of non-Income Taxes
that are accrued or otherwise reflected in the calculation of the Post-Closing
Adjustment in accordance with Section 1.10  exceed the amount reflected, the
Purchaser shall promptly pay such excess to the Seller.

Section 7.03          _Tax Contests_.

 

 

(a) If any Taxing Authority notifies the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of
a Tax Claim that relates to Pre-Closing Taxes, then the Purchaser shall
promptly provide written  notice thereof to the Seller. Such notice shall
include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the
Taxing Authority.

 

 

(b) The Seller shall have the sole right and obligation to control, at its own
expense, any Tax Claim relating solely to Tax Returns of the Transferred
Entities for Pre-Closing  Tax Periods (other than Straddle Periods), Tax
Returns relating to the Transferred Assets for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other
than Straddle Periods) and Combined Income Tax Returns; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that with respect to any Tax Claim (other than any Tax Claim
relating to any Combined Income Tax Returns), the outcome of which could
reasonably be expected to  increase the Tax liability of the Purchaser, any
Transferred Entity or any of their Affiliates (other than as a result of an
issue being raised by a Taxing Authority which merely by the application of
the same or similar principles could be  expected to result in a proposed
deficiency for any Post-Closing Tax Period), the Seller shall provide copies
of material written correspondence between the Seller and the Taxing Authority
relating to such Tax Claim (subject to redaction of  information unrelated to

8023 (and all forms under analogous provisions of state or local Law), in

reasonable out-of-pocket legal  and accounting fees and reasonable out-of-

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

 

(i) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not have any right to
indemnification under this Section 7.10 with  respect to, or based on, Taxes
to the extent such Taxes (A) are due to the unavailability of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attributes in any Post-Closing Tax
Period, (B) result from transactions or actions taken by the  Purchaser
Indemnified Parties on the Closing Date after the Closing which are outside of
the Ordinary Course of Business to the extent such transactions or actions are

obligation under this  Agreement to pay any Taxes described in this clause

-73-  


 

 

(ii) the indemnification obligation of the Seller under this Section 7.10 __
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(f)(iv).

 

 

(c) If the Seller makes any payment to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 7.10,  the Seller shall be subrogated to

Taxes indemnified by the Seller provided that such subrogation could not
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the  operations, affairs,
customer or supplier relationships or prospects of the MCC Business;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the Seller's right to subrogation with respect
to insurance carriers shall not be subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller's right to
subrogation shall at all times be limited by the terms of the RandW Policy to
the extent the RandW Policy specifically limits or  restricts such right.

Section 7.10 shall survive in  full force and effect until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, at which time they shall terminate and
no claims shall be made for indemnification under this
Section           7.10 thereafter.

 

 

(e) All indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes to the extent
consistent with applicable Law.

 

 

Section 7.11          _Written Notice_. A Purchaser Indemnified
Party's failure to give reasonably prompt written  notice to the Seller of
any actual, threatened or possible claim or demand that might give rise to a
right of indemnification under Section 7.10 or rights with respect to 
participation or otherwise with respect to a Tax Claim pursuant to Section
7.03 shall not relieve the Seller of any Liability that the Seller may have to
the Purchaser  Indemnified Party unless the failure to give such written
notice actually prejudiced the Seller with respect to such claim.

shall cause its Affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any Transferred
Employee who is terminated during the Continuation Period in  an amount that

Plan in which the Transferred Employee participated in immediately prior  to
the Closing; _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing shall not apply for benefit
accrual purposes under  any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
