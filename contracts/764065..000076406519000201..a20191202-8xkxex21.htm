This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (as the same may be amended from time to
time in accordance with its terms, this "Agreement"), dated as of December 2,
2019, is by and among AK Steel Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Parent"), and
Pepper Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub are
each referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties."

RECITALS

WHEREAS, (i) the respective boards of directors of each of Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and declared advisable and in the best
interest of their respective equityholders, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company being the surviving entity (the "Merger") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the board of
directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger and the
issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code") and (ii) this Agreement, as
well as any other agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement, will
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368â€‘2(g) and Section 1.368-3(a); and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company with all of its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II.

1.2 Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company
and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Jones Day, 

901 Lakeside Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44114, at 10:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the
third Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof in
accordance with this Agreement; provided, that if the Marketing Period has not
ended as of the above referenced time, the Closing will occur on the earlier
of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent in writing on no
fewer than five Business Days' notice to the Company (a "Closing Date Notice")
(provided that any Closing Date Notice may be withdrawn and a new Closing Date
Notice may be delivered with respect to a later Closing Date to occur prior to
the date in the following clause (b) on no less than two Business Days' notice
to the Company) and (b) the third Business Day immediately following the last
day of the Marketing Period. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to hereinafter as the "Closing Date."

1.3 Effective Time. As soon as practicable, on the Closing Date, the Company
and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to
be duly executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL, and make any other
filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Company or
Merger Sub under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the
Company and Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 Tax Consequences. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) this Agreement, including any
amendments thereto, be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization"
involving the Merger for purposes of Section 368 and Section 354 of the Code.

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

4.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a)Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(each a "Company Share," and collectively, the "Company Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Restricted Shares, Company Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub and Company
Shares owned by the Company, and in each case, not held on behalf of third
parties (each an "Excluded Company Share" and collectively, "Excluded Company
Shares")) shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, 0.400 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a fully paid and nonassessable share (with respect to
each Company Share, other than Excluded Company Shares, the "Per Share Merger
Consideration," and with respect to all of the issued and outstanding Company
Shares, other than Excluded Company Shares, the "Merger Consideration") of
common stock, par value $0.125 per share, of Parent (each, a "Parent Share"
and collectively, the "Parent Shares"). At the Effective Time, all of the
Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of the Company
Shares, and each non-certificated Company Share represented by book entry
(each, a "Book Entry Company Share") (other than in each case those
representing Excluded Company Shares), shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration and the
right, if any, to receive (i) pursuant to Section 4.2(f) cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant
to this Section 4.1(a) and (ii) any distribution or dividend pursuant to
Section 4.2(d).

(b)Each Company Share that is an Excluded Company Share shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, with no consideration paid in exchange therefor (other
than Company Restricted Shares, which are subject to Section 4.5(d)).

(c)At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2 Exchange of Company Shares.

(a)Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange
agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, (i) prior
to the Effective Time, certificates, or at Parent's option, evidence of non-
certificated Parent Shares in book-entry form ("Book Entry Parent Shares"),
and cash to be paid to holders of Company Shares in lieu of fractional shares
in accordance with Section 4.2(f), in each case constituting at least the
amounts necessary for the Merger Consideration (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent necessary in order to pay the Merger Consideration to
former holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Article IV, Parent
shall, from time to time after the Effective Time, deposit additional
certificates of Parent Shares or Book Entry Parent Shares, and/or cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares, with the Exchange Agent) and (ii) as necessary
from time to time after the Effective Time, if applicable, any cash and
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Shares to be
issued or to be paid pursuant to Section 4.2(d), 

in exchange for Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(h)) or Book Entry Company Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV (certificates for Parent Shares and evidence of
Book Entry Parent Shares, together with the amount of cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
this Article IV with respect thereto, collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall invest the cash available in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in obligations,
funds or accounts typical for (including having liquidity typical for)
transactions of this nature. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in the
Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be
promptly returned to Parent. The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent
for the Company's stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their
Certificates and Book Entry Company Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby.

(b)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Shares (other than
Excluded Company Shares) that are (i) evidenced by Certificates or (ii) Book
Entry Company Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") (A)
a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book Entry Company Shares shall pass only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 4.2(h)) or transfer of the Book Entry Company Shares to the Exchange
Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" with respect to Book Entry Company Shares)) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates) or transferring the Book Entry Company Shares to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions, in each case, which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 4.2(d). With respect to Book Entry Company Shares
held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or
after the Closing Date (but in no event later than the third Business Day
following the Closing Date), upon surrender of Company Shares (other than
Excluded Company Shares) held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance
with DTC's customary surrender procedures, the Per Share Merger Consideration
and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which the beneficial
owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(c)Procedures for Surrender.

(i)After the Effective Time, and (A) upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) that are Certificates, by
physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate, as provided in Section 4.2(h)) in accordance with the terms of
the letter of transmittal and accompanying instructions, (B) upon the transfer
of Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) that 

are Book Entry Company Shares not held through DTC, in accordance with the
terms of the letter of transmittal and accompanying instructions (including
the delivery of an "agent's message") or (C) upon the transfer of Company
Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) that are Book Entry Company Shares
held through DTC, including by delivery of an "agent's message," in accordance
with DTC's customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent,
the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Company Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
thereof as promptly as practicable, (1) the number of certificates of Parent
Shares or Book Entry Parent Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section
4.1(a), (2) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
4.2(d), and (3) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Shares payable
pursuant to Section 4.2(f), if applicable.

(ii)In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Exchange Agent may make
payment of the proper amount of Per Share Merger Consideration (and, to the
extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
4.2(f) or any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(d)) to such
transferee if (A) in the case of Book Entry Company Shares, written
instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book Entry Company Shares are
presented to the Exchange Agent, (B) in the case of Certificates, the
Certificates formerly representing such Company Shares are surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, and (C) the written instructions, in the case of clause (A),
and Certificates, in the case of clause (B), are accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Exchange Agent. If any Parent Shares are to be delivered to a Person other
than the holder in whose name any Company Shares are registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the transfer of
Parent Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of any Company
Shares, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(iii)No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
the Company Shares. Any Certificate that has been surrendered shall be
cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

(iv)Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and any
other third-party paying agent (each a "Payor") shall each be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as a
Payor is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such consideration
under the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by a Payor and
timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 

(d)Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares. All Parent Shares
to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Parent in respect of Parent Shares, the record date for which is
at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions in respect of all Merger Consideration issuable pursuant
to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent
Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Book Entry Company Share until such Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(h)) or Book
Entry Company Share is transferred for exchange in accordance with this
Article IV. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.2(h)) or transfer of such Book Entry Company Share that
has been converted into the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration,
there shall be issued or paid to the holder of the certificates representing
whole Parent Shares (or as applicable, Book Entry Parent Shares) issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or
transfer, the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent
Shares and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares with a
record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to surrender or transfer, as applicable.

(e)Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Company Share is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration (and
to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 4.2(f) or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
4.2(d)) to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

(f)Fractional Company Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional Parent Shares will be issued and any holder of
Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share but for this
Section 4.2(f) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof,
without interest, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and
shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the closing
prices per Parent Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), as
reported in the Wall Street Journal (or if not reported thereby, as reported
in another authoritative source), for the five full trading days ending on the
second Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time
occurs multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into
account all Company Shares held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
Parent Shares.

(g)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any Parent Shares)
that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after
the Effective Time shall 

be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Company Shares (other than Excluded
Company Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any Per Share Merger
Consideration (and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 4.2(f) or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 4.2(d)), payable or issuable pursuant to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2
upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(h)) or transfer of Book Entry Company
Shares, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares (other than
Excluded Company Shares) immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange
Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(h)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
a reasonable and customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably
required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Exchange Agent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, and (to the extent applicable) any cash pursuant to Section
4.2(f) or unpaid dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(d),
that would have been payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered.

4.3 No Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and
Section 1701.84 of the Ohio Revised Code, no appraisal rights shall be
available to the holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.4 Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Company Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Company Shares or the issued and outstanding Parent Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Parent Shares,
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, combination,
subdivision, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or 

other similar transaction, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per
Share Merger Consideration; provided that nothing in this Section 4.4 shall be
construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any of the foregoing actions
with respect to its respective securities to the extent otherwise prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

4.5 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a)Company Options.

(i)At least 30 days prior to the expected Closing Date, the Company shall
provide each holder of an option to purchase Company Shares (each, a "Company
Option") that was granted under a Pre-2016 Stock Plan (a "Pre-2016 Option"),
whether vested or unvested, written notice (in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent) of such holder's right pursuant to the applicable Pre-2016 Stock Plan
to elect, no later than one day prior to the Closing Date, to cancel his or
her Pre-2016 Option in exchange for a cash amount equal to the product of (A)
the number of Company Shares subject to such Pre-2016 Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Option Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share subject to such
Pre-2016 Option (such cash amount the "Cash-Out Option Payment"). The "Per
Share Option Consideration" shall mean the greater of (X) the product of the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the volume weighted average trading price of a
Parent Share for the five consecutive trading days ending with, and including,
the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date, or (Y) the highest
average of the highest and lowest sales price per Company Share on a trading
day during the 90-day period ending on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Each Pre-2016 Option for which a holder makes an election
described in this Section 4.5(a)(i) shall be referred to as a "Cash-Out
Option."

(ii)At the Effective Time, each Cash-Out Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest
and less applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the Cash-Out Option Payment.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not a Cash-Out Option and
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Converted Company Option"), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into an option to acquire a number of Parent Shares (rounded down to
the nearest whole number) equal to (A) the number of Company Shares subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (C) the exercise price per Company Share of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (D) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each Converted Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms and double-trigger termination
protection) as were applicable under such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b)Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect
of Company Shares with only time-based vesting requirements (each, a "Company
RSU") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into a restricted stock unit
denominated in Parent Shares relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company 

RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such restricted stock unit shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including vesting terms and double-trigger termination
protection) as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(c)Company Performance Share Awards. At the Effective Time, each performance
share award in respect of Company Shares with any performance-based vesting
requirements (a "Company PSA") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into a performance share award denominated in
Parent Shares (i) relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) equal to (A) the number of Company Shares that would
have been issued under such Company PSA at the achievement of target
performance, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) with performance
goals adjusted by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the
board of directors of the Company, as mutually determined by Parent and the
Company, to take into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which shall include the same opportunity to earn the maximum percentage of
performance shares as under the Company PSA award agreement immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such performance share award shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms and double-
trigger termination protection) as were applicable to such Company PSA
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)Company Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each Company Share
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions pursuant to an
award (a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into restricted shares denominated in
Parent Shares relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of Company Restricted Shares
held by a holder, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such
restricted share shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting terms and double-trigger termination protection)
as were applicable to such Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e)Corporate Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of
directors of the Company and the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 4.5. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of the Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs or Company
PSAs. As of no later than the Effective Time and if necessary, Parent shall
file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 (or other applicable
form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to the Converted Company
Options, Company RSUs, Company PSAs and Company Restricted Shares that are
converted pursuant to this Section 4.5.

statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), it being
agreed that nothing disclosed in the Company Reports will be deemed to modify
or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1(a),
Section 5.1(b)(i), Section 5.1(c), or Section 5.1(t), or in the corresponding
sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the
Company prior to or simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

(a)Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its

leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in

any Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares or rights in such Company
Shares or Company Preferred Shares.

the Company, (3) preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind

any Subsidiary of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
capital stock or securities of, or ownership interests in, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or
securities of, or ownership interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company. The Company does not have any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party with respect to the voting of or restricting the transfer
of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company.

complete and accurate list, as of the close of business on November 26, 2019,
of each Company Equity Award, including the date of grant, term, number of

(iv)Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan pursuant to which it was
issued, (B) has an exercise price per Company Share equal to or greater than
the fair market value of a Company Share on the date of such grant, (C) has a
grant date identical to the date on which the Company's board of directors or
compensation committee thereof actually awarded such Company Option, and (D)
qualifies for the Tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option
in the Company's Tax Returns and the Company Reports, respectively.

(v)Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each
of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a "Lien"), other than
Liens securing the Company's existing indebtedness that, as of the date of
this Agreement, are anticipated to be terminated in connection with the
repayment or refinancing of such indebtedness in connection with the Closing
and restrictions under applicable securities Laws. There are no Company Shares
owned by any Subsidiary of the Company.

(c)Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares
entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders' meeting duly called and
held for such purpose (the "Requisite Company Vote"). The Requisite Company
Vote is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company that is
necessary under applicable Law, NYSE rules, and the Company's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws to adopt, approve and authorize this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles
(the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

(ii)The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously approved this
Agreement and declared advisable and in the best interest of its stockholders,
the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity, and
resolved to recommend the adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Company
Shares (the "Company Recommendation"), (B) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Company Shares for their adoption, and (C)
received the 

oral opinion of the Company's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC (to
be confirmed by delivery of a written opinion), to the effect that, as of the
date of this Agreement and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth in the written
opinion, the Exchange Ratio provided for in this Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent
and its Affiliates). A signed copy of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs and
Co. LLC rendered to the board of directors of the Company will be promptly
delivered to Parent, solely for informational purposes, following receipt
thereof by the Company.

(d)Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc. (i) Other than
the filings or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.3, (B) under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), and with any other
applicable national, federal, state or foreign applicable Laws that are

competition or restraint of trade (together with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust
Laws"), the Foreign Investment Laws, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
(C) required to be made with the NYSE, and (D) under state securities,
takeover and "blue sky" Laws, no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations,

commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial
governmental entity (each, a "Governmental Entity"), in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or
in connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, except those that the failure
to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii)The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under, the loss of any benefits
under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to (1) any written agreement, lease, license,
contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a
"Contract") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, (2)
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby)
receipt of all applicable consents contemplated by Section 5.1(d)(i)
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the consents contemplated in clauses
(A)-(D) therein), any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, conflict, violation,
termination, default, creation, acceleration, loss or change that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(e)Company Reports; Financial Statements. (i) The Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since December
31, 2016 (the "Applicable Date") (the forms, statements, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto,
the "Company Reports"). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing
or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will when so
filed or furnished comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and none of the
Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of
this Agreement will when so filed or furnished, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(ii)The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company
maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in and meeting
the requirements of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange
Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (B) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company, and (C) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets that would be reasonably
likely to have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to its
auditors and the audit committee of its board of directors (1) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has
identified for the Company's auditors and audit committee of its board of
directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no material complaints from
any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and no material concerns from Company employees 

regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by
the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, there have not been, since the
Applicable Date, any material complaints or concerns made through the
Company's whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of Law, that remain outstanding or
unresolved.

(iii)Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports,
including any related notes and schedules, fairly presents in all material
respects, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present in all material respects, the results of
operations, cash flows, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be
material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

(f)Absence of Certain Changes. (i) Since September 30, 2019, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
course of such businesses consistent with past practices.

(ii)Since September 30, 2019, there has not been any change in the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' operations or any circumstance, occurrence or
development that individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(iii)From December 31, 2018, through the date of this Agreement, there has not
been any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practices
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required by changes in
GAAP or the Exchange Act.

(iv)From September 30, 2019, through the date of this Agreement, there has not
been any material increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to
any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' officers or employees (except for
increases in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice).

(g)Litigation and Liabilities. There are no civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to
result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree or award of any Governmental Entity. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company 

or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, other than: (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the most recent
balance sheet included in the Company Reports or in the notes to such balance
sheet; (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business since September 30, 2019; (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) liabilities
or obligations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any off-balance sheet partnership, joint venture or any similar
arrangement (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any other Person, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance
sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
Securities Act).

(h)Employee Benefits. (i) Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth an accurate and complete list of each material Company Benefit
Plan. With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of the following items (in each
case, only if applicable): (A) plan documents and all related trust
agreements, insurance contracts, or other funding arrangements; (B) written
descriptions of any Company Benefit Plans that are not set forth in writing;
(C) the most recent summary plan description together with the summary or
summaries of material modifications thereto; (D) the most recent annual
actuarial valuation; (E) the most recently filed annual report on IRS Form
5500 and all schedules thereto; (F) the most recent determination letter or
opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan and related trust intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and any pending request for such a determination
letter; and (G) all material non-routine correspondence to or from any
Governmental Entity received in the last three years with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, with respect to any issue that remains outstanding.

(ii)Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate contributes to, is required to contribute to, or has in the last six
years contributed to or been required to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan.
Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Company ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any "withdrawal liability" (within the meaning of Section 4201 of
ERISA) with respect to a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in
full or has (or is reasonably expected to have) any other current or
contingent liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan.

(iii)Except as would not result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no action, dispute, suit, claim, arbitration,
or legal, administrative or other proceeding or governmental action (by any
Person or Governmental Entity) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened (A) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course, (B) alleging any breach of the material terms
of any Company Benefit Plan or any fiduciary duties by the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or employees with
respect thereto or (C) with respect to any violation of any applicable Law
with respect to such Company Benefit Plan. 

(iv)Each Company Benefit Plan (including any related trusts) has been
established, operated, maintained, funded and administered in compliance with
its terms and with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except
for such non-compliance which would not result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or any
"party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to a Company Benefit
Plan has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA. Each Company Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS that has not been
revoked and, except as would not result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company no fact or
event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or opinion
letter from the IRS that would adversely affect the qualification or tax
exemption of any such Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to or is required to contribute to any
plan, agreement or arrangement which provides post-termination or post-
retirement health or life insurance benefits or coverage to any Person, other
than for continuation coverage required to be provided pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code or any similar state law, continuation of benefits through
the remainder of the month in which a termination of employment occurs, or the
right to convert a group insurance policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to an individual insurance policy.

(v)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate sponsors, maintains or contributes to or in the last six years has
sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to, or
has (or is reasonably expected to have) any current or contingent liability
with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code (excluding Multiemployer Plans), or a "multiple employer plan"
subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. No
liability under Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code in
respect of a Company Benefit Plan has been incurred by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full. With respect to any Company Benefit Plan subject to the minimum funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (A) no such plan
is, or is expected to be, in "at-risk" status (within the meaning of Section
303(i)(4)(A) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4)(A) of the Code), (B) the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such Company Benefit Plan, and (C) except as would not result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
"reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any
such event for which the 30 day notice requirement has been waived under the
regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event
described in Sections 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred.

(vi)Except as would not result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, all
contributions, premiums and other payments due from any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries required by Law or any Company Benefit Plan have been made
under any such plan to any fund, trust or account established thereunder or in
connection therewith by the due date thereof or accrued in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. 

(vii)The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee, director, officer
or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material compensatory payment, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or materially increase the amount of compensation due to any such employee,
director, officer or independent contractor, (C) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness or obligation to fund benefits under a Company Benefit Plan with
respect to any such employee, director or officer, (D) directly or indirectly
cause the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or (E) result in any amount failing
to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code. No director, officer,
employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is entitled to a gross up, make whole or other similar payment as a result of
the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code
pursuant to any agreement or arrangement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(viii)Except as would not result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit Plan that is a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code
has been maintained in documentary and operational compliance with Section
409A of the Code.

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except with respect to regulatory matters covered by Section
6.5, to the Knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention

licenses, permits, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents,
authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions, allowances, credits and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity ("Licenses") necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted, except those the absence of which

reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

there any basis for any such charge, indictment or investigation, and (F)
since the Applicable Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has been or is now a party to any administrative or civil litigation
alleging noncompliance with any Anti-Corruption Law, nor, to the Company's
Knowledge, is there any basis for any such proceeding.

(j)Takeover Statutes. Other than Section 203 of DGCL (from which the Company
has taken all action necessary to exempt the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), no "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each,
a "Takeover Statute") or any anti-takeover provision in the Company's

there are no other conditions or occurrences involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that if known by a Governmental Entity or other third Person

cost or restriction on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
Environmental Law. 

(l)Tax Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has taken or

control over financial reporting and (2) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in

accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material concerns from Parent
employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been
received by Parent.

operations, cash flows, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,

actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to

repair, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(l)Brokers and Finders. None of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, except that Parent has employed Moelis and Company LLC and Credit
Suisse Group AG as its financial advisors in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the fees of which will be paid by Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent.

(m)Financing.

(i)Parent will have sufficient funds available to it for Parent and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, to complete the Merger and
refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company ABL Credit
Agreement and the Senior Secured Indenture, to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 4.2(f), and to satisfy the respective
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub as and when contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay or otherwise perform such obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under any agreement or documents 

entered into in connection with the Merger (including any fees and expenses
relating to the Financing).

(ii)Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) a
fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement
(including all schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto) (the "Commitment
Letter") and (ii) the fully executed fee letters referenced therein, relating
to fees with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(collectively, the "Fee Letter," and together with the Commitment Letter,
collectively, the "Commitment Papers"), by and among Parent and the Financing
Sources specified therein (with only fee amounts and other economic terms, and
the "flex" provisions, redacted, none of which redacted provisions would
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or amount of
the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter). As used herein, the
debt financing contemplated in the Commitment Papers, together with, unless
the context otherwise requires, any replacement financing, including any bank
financing or debt securities issued in lieu thereof, is collectively referred
to as the "Financing." As of the date of this Agreement, each of the
Commitment Papers is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no amendment or modification in any manner that is
potentially adverse to the Company is contemplated as of the date of this
Agreement (other than as set forth in the Fee Letter with respect to flex
rights and/or to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents and similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Papers as of
the date of this Agreement), and each of the Commitment Papers, in the form so
delivered, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is
enforceable against, Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. Except as set forth in the Commitment Papers and except for any
engagement letters, fee credit letters and fee letters related to the
permanent financing described in the Commitment Papers, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no contracts, agreements, "side letters" or other
arrangements to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
is a party relating to the Commitment Papers or the Financing.

(iii)As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to constitute, a default or breach by Parent or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, of any term of the Commitment Papers. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Financing Source party to the Commitment Letter
has notified Parent in writing of its termination or repudiation (or intent to
terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Commitment Letter or
intent not to provide all or any portion of the Financing. Assuming the truth
and accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.1 and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, in
each case, in all material respects, and assuming satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 7.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver thereof), Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the availability and funding, as applicable, of the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Papers will fail to be satisfied on the Closing Date or that
the full amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter will not be
available to be funded on the Closing Date to the extent required to refinance
in full all amounts outstanding under the Company ABL Credit Agreement and the
Senior Secured Indenture, to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in 

accordance with Section 4.2(f) and to pay the fees and expenses relating to
the Merger and the Financing.

(iv)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Merger as
set forth in this Agreement is not contingent on Parent's ability to obtain
any financing, whether pursuant to the Commitment Papers or otherwise.

(v)As of the date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid (or caused to
be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment
Papers to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The only conditions
precedent related to the obligations of the Financing Sources party to the
Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter are expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.

aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, since the Applicable Date, (A) Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries
have complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws; (B) no

Environmental Law.

(o)Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed
to take any action, nor does Parent have any Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

6.2 Acquisition Proposals.

(a)No-Solicitation. Each of the Company and Parent agree that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2 from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and each shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors, agents or representatives (such Persons, collectively,
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

(i)initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, in the case of the Company, or any
Parent Acquisition Proposal, in the case of Parent;

(ii)enter into, engage in, maintain, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or otherwise make available any
material non-public information or data to, any Person other than the other
Parties, or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
(a "Third Party") that is reasonably likely to be considering or seeking to
make, or has made within the 12 months preceding the date of this Agreement, a
Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company) or a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent), in each case relating to, or as
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal or a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, respectively; or

(iii)enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, memorandum of
understanding or other Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.2(b)) relating to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (in
the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of
Parent) (any of the foregoing, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

(iv)Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party or its Representatives, with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of Parent), or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be, and shall promptly request that each
Third Party to whom confidential information has been furnished or otherwise
made available by or on behalf of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries within
the 12 month period preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with,
or for the purpose of evaluating, a Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition 

Proposal, promptly return or destroy all such confidential information so
furnished or otherwise made available. Neither the Company nor Parent shall,
and each shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend, release
or modify in any respect any standstill or other similar provision of any
confidentiality agreement to which any of them is a party in connection with a
Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, respectively, or
other proposal, inquiry or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of any such
confidentiality agreements, including by seeking injunctions to prevent any
known breaches of any such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof, except in each case if such Party's board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that taking such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b)No-Solicitation Exception. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 6.2(a), prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote
(in the case of the Company) or the Requisite Parent Vote (in the case of
Parent) is obtained, if (i) the Company receives a bona fide Company
Acquisition Proposal, or Parent receives a bona fide Parent Acquisition
Proposal, that, in either case, did not result from a breach by such Party or
its Subsidiaries or Representatives of this Section 6.2, (ii) the board of
directors of such Party determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal,
as applicable, and (iii) the board of directors of such Party determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then, before (but not after) the Requisite Company Vote (in
the case of the Company) or the Requisite Parent Vote (in the case of Parent)
is obtained, the Company or Parent, as applicable, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions
with such Third Party making the Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding a Company Acquisition
Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, and (B) furnish to
such Third Party or its Representatives information, including material non-
public information relating to, and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books and records of, such Party and its Subsidiaries, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such Party shall promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) provide to the other Parties any such
information that is provided to any such Third Party which was not previously
provided to or made available to such other Parties; provided, further, that
such Party and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) following the
time that such Party's board of directors determines in good faith that such
Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company's board of directors)
or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent's board of directors)
does not constitute and would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal, respectively, terminate
such negotiations, discussion and information access.

(c)Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.2(d),
Section 6.2(f) and Section 6.2(h), the board of directors of the Company and
each committee thereof, on the one hand, and the board of directors of Parent
and each committee thereof, on the other hand, 

shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) fail to include the Company
Recommendation (in the case of the Company) or the Parent Recommendation (in
the case of Parent) in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, (ii) withdraw (or
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the other Parties) the Company
Recommendation (in the case of the Company) or the Parent Recommendation (in
the case of Parent) or publicly propose to do so, (iii) make any public
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than
a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by its board of directors of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, or fail to recommend against acceptance of such a tender or
exchange offer by the close of business on the earlier of (A) the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act and (B) the second Business Day
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of the Company) or the
Parent Shareholders Meeting (in the case of Parent), as the same may be
postponed in accordance with Section 6.4(a)) (it being understood and agreed
that such Party's board of directors may take no position with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company) or a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent) that is a tender offer or
exchange offer during the applicable period referred to in clause (A) or
clause (B) without such non-position constituting, in and of itself, an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change or Adverse Parent Recommendation
Change), (iv) (except as permitted by Section 6.2(d)) adopt, approve,
recommend to its stockholders, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any
Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company) or any Parent
Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent) resolve or agree to publicly
propose to take any such actions, or (v) other than with respect to a tender
offer or exchange offer, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation
(in the case of the Company) or the Parent Recommendation (in the case of
Parent) within three Business Days following receipt of a written notice from
Parent (in the case of the Company) or the Company (in the case of Parent),
delivered after a Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the Company) or
a Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent) has become publicly
known, which notice requests such reaffirmation (or, if earlier, the date that
is two Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of
the Company) or the Parent Shareholders Meeting (in the case of Parent), as
the same may be postponed in accordance with Section 6.4(a)) (each such action
set forth in this Section 6.2(c) with respect to the Company's board of
directors being referred to herein as an "Adverse Company Recommendation
Change," and each such action set forth in this Section 6.2(c) with respect to
Parent's board of directors being referred to herein as an "Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change").

(d)Permitted Changes of Recommendation and Termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, if
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote (in the case of
the Company) or the Requisite Parent Vote (in the case of Parent) is obtained,
(i) the Company or Parent receives a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal
(in the case of the Company) or bona fide Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Parent) that did not result from a breach by the receiving Party of
this Section 6.2 and (ii) the board of directors of the receiving Party
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of
the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent)
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal,
respectively, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the board of directors of
the receiving Party 

may, after complying with Section 6.2(f), make an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.3(d) or Section 8.4(d), as applicable, in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the applicable Company
Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal.

(e)Certain Permitted Disclosure. In addition, nothing contained in this
Section 6.2 shall prevent the Company or Parent or either of their boards of
directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any legally required
disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (provided that neither the disclosing Party nor its board of
directors may effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of
the Company) or an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of
Parent) unless permitted by Section 6.2(d) or Section 6.2(h)) or (ii) issuing
a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that if any disclosure made in reliance on
this Section 6.2(e) does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation (in the case
of the Company) or Parent Recommendation (in the case of Parent), such
disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Company Recommendation Change or
Adverse Parent Recommendation Change, respectively, and, in the case of an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change, Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4(a), and, in the case of
an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change, the Company shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.3(a).

(f)Match Rights. The board of directors of the Company, on the one hand, and
the board of directors of Parent, on the other hand, shall not take any action
set forth in Section 6.2(d) unless it has first:

(i)caused the Company or Parent, as applicable, to provide the other Party at
least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intent to make an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or an
Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent), in each case, in
accordance with Section 6.2(d) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"), which notice
shall (A) state that the notifying Party has received a Company Superior
Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal, as applicable, (B) specify the material
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior
Proposal, (C) identify the Person making such Company Superior Proposal or
Parent Superior Proposal, and (D) enclose the most recent draft of any
agreements intended to be entered into in connection with such Company
Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that the delivery of the notification contemplated by this clause (i) shall
not, in and of itself, constitute an Adverse Company Recommendation Change or
Adverse Parent Recommendation Change);

(ii)caused the notifying Party and its Representatives to negotiate, to the
extent the other Party so wishes to negotiate, during such four Business Day
period following delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice
Period"), in good faith with the other Party concerning any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement that the other Party wishes to propose in response to
such Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal; and 

(iii)following the end of the Notice Period, determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal,
respectively, after taking into account any changes to which the other Party
has committed in writing to make to this Agreement, and that the failure to
make an Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or
an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) or to
terminate this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with Section 6.2(d)
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that if, during the Notice Period, any revisions are made
to the financial or other material terms of the Company Superior Proposal or
Parent Superior Proposal that is the subject of such Notice of Superior
Proposal, the notifying Party shall deliver to the other Party a new notice
describing such revisions (and providing copies of the most recent draft of
any agreements implementing such revisions) and shall comply with the
requirements of clause (i) and clause (ii) of this Section 6.2(f) (except that
the four Business Day Notice Period shall instead be a two Business Day Notice
Period).

(g)Notice of Acquisition Proposals. Each of the Company and Parent shall
notify the other promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt
by such Party (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Parent), or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the
Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent), which notice
shall include the material terms and conditions of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer
or request, copies of any material written communications and draft
documentation received relating to such Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal and indicating the name of the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer
or request, and thereafter the notifying Party shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed, on a timely basis, of the status and material terms of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, offer or request (including any amendments thereto) and the status
of any discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives
(without prejudice to the restrictions set forth in Section 6.2(a) and the
other provisions of this Section 6.2) and provide copies of all material
written communications and draft documentation received relating to such
Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(h)Intervening Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
6.2(c), the board of directors of the Company, on the one hand, and the board
of directors of Parent, on the other hand, may at any time prior to (but not
after) obtaining the Requisite Company Vote (in the case of the Company) or
the Requisite Parent Vote (in the case of Parent) effect an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change or Adverse Parent Recommendation Change, respectively,
if (i) a Company Intervening Event (in the case of the Company) or Parent
Intervening Event (in the case of Parent) occurs and (ii) the board of
directors of the Company (in the case of a Company Intervening Event) or
Parent (in the case of a Parent Intervening Event) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that
the failure to effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of
the Company) or an Adverse 

Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) in response to such
Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, respectively, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that the
board of directors of the Party in respect of which such Company Intervening
Event (in the case of the Company) or Parent Intervening Event (in the case of
Parent) occurs has first (x) caused such Party to provide the other Party at
least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intent to effect such an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change or Adverse Parent Recommendation Change,
which shall specify in reasonable detail the circumstances related to such
determination, (y) caused such Party and its Representatives to negotiate, to
the extent the other Party so wishes to negotiate, during such four Business
Day period following delivery of such notice, in good faith with the other
Party concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that the other
Party wishes to propose in response to such Company Intervening Event or
Parent Intervening Event, and (z) after complying with clause (x) and clause
(y), determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to effect an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) in response to such Company
Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, respectively, continues to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law after taking into
account any changes committed in writing to be made to this Agreement by the
other Party.

6.3 Proxy Filing; Information Supplied.

(a)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting and the
Parent Shareholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Prospectus/Proxy Statement") in preliminary form, and Parent
shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement on
Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger, which
shall include the Prospectus/Proxy Statement (the "S-4 Registration
Statement"). Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Prospectus/Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing (and keep the S-4
Registration Statement effective for so long as may be necessary to consummate
the Merger), and promptly thereafter each of the Company and Parent shall mail
their respective Prospectus/Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders.
Each of the Parties shall promptly furnish to the other all non-privileged
information concerning such Party that is required by applicable Law to be
included in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Sâ€‘4 Registration Statement
so as to enable Parent to file the S-4 Registration Statement and the Company
and Parent to file the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any of
its Representatives for use in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement if and to the extent that such information is
discovered by Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to be or to have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Each of the Company and
Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide
the other Party with copies of any written comments and advise the other Party
of any oral comments with respect to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement received by such Party from the SEC, including any
request from the SEC for amendments 

or supplements thereto, and shall provide the other with copies of all other
material or substantive correspondence between it and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration
Statement or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent shall provide the other Party and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and consider in good
faith the comments of the other Party in connection with any such document or
response. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Representatives
shall agree to participate in any material or substantive meeting or
conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of the staff
thereof, in respect of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration
Statement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other Party to participate. Parent
shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the
time of effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement, and the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of
Parent Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall
also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder, in connection with the issuance of the Parent
Shares in the Merger.

(b)The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 Registration
Statement will, at the time the Sâ€‘4 Registration Statement becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders
and at the times of the meeting of stockholders of each of the Company and
Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent will cause
the S-4 Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(c)If at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the
Requisite Parent Vote, the Company or Parent discovers that any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each of the Company and
Parent. 

(d)Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
(to the extent reasonably available to the applicable Party) stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the SEC or the
NYSE in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4
Registration Statement.

and vote upon (A) the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger, and (B) at
Parent's election, an amendment to Parent's Third Amended Articles of
Incorporation to increase the authorized number of Parent Shares and (ii) as
soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 35 calendar days)
following the commencement of the mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
pursuant to clause (i) above, convene and hold the 

Parent Shareholders Meeting; provided that Parent may adjourn or postpone the
Parent Shareholders Meeting to a later date to the extent Parent believes in

amount of time in advance of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, (B) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain
the Requisite Parent Vote (including after commencement of a Parent Superior

reasonable best efforts to convene the Parent Shareholders Meeting and the
Company Stockholders Meeting on the same date and to establish the same record
date for both the Parent Shareholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders

States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission, or
private party challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to resolve any such objection or challenge and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order that results from such action or proceeding that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger on or before the End Date. If Parent
defends any litigation or similar proceeding brought by any Governmental
Entity, including Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any state attorney general or private party in
connection with the Merger, Parent will promptly reimburse the Company for any
reasonable and documented expenses and costs (including out-of-pocket
auditor's and attorney's fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' or Representatives' involvement therewith. The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act.

(ii)Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5 will (and
"reasonable best efforts" will in no event) require or be construed to require
Parent to proffer to or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or hold separate, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however that if
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law and to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as the enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable (and, in no event, no later than the End Date), Parent shall agree
to any changes (including through a licensing, supply or other arrangement) or
restriction(s) on the current or future business operations of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation; provided further that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent will not be required to
take (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take, without the prior
written consent of Parent) any actions that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to (1) have a material adverse effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
after giving effect to the Merger, taken as a whole, or (2) have an economic
effect on Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation in an amount that
would be material when compared to the benefits anticipated to be derived by
Parent and its Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger.

(iii)Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the joint right to direct all matters with
any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided
that each Party shall permit the other Parties to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each of Parent and the Company will consult with the
other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any proposed 

substantive communication to any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement)). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of a disagreement regarding the strategy, tactics,
or decisions relating to obtaining all consents, approvals, or authorizations
necessary under the Antitrust Laws from any Governmental Entity, Parent shall
have the final and ultimate authority over the appropriate strategy, tactics,
and decisions. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 6.5 as "outside counsel only."

(b)Information. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that the limitations set forth in
the provisos to Section 6.7 shall apply to the Company's and Parent's
obligations, mutatis mutandis. In addition, each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the information concerning it
necessary to enable the Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma
financial statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation
of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement.

(c)Status.

(i)Subject to applicable Law and as required by any Governmental Entity, the
Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of written notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or
any of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect to such
transactions. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt notice to the
other of any change, fact or condition of which it becomes aware that would be
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or any breach by such Party of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder that would
reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any condition to the other
Party's obligations to effect the Merger hereunder. Subject to Section 6.5(a),
neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other
Representatives or agents to participate in any substantive meeting,
conference, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. 

(ii)Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(c)(i),
the Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other Party if it
obtains knowledge of (A) any written notice or other written communication
from any counterparty to a Material Contract with regard to any action,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with
respect to such material Contract in connection with the consummation of the
Merger (and provide a copy thereof) or (B) any written notice or other written
communication from any other Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger (and provide a copy
thereof). The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any
written notice or other written communication received after the date of this
Agreement from any party to any Material Contract to the effect that such
Party has terminated or intends to terminate or otherwise materially adversely
modify its relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party's failure to comply with this Section
6.5(c)(ii) (provided that such failure was not in bad faith) shall not
constitute a failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied, or otherwise provide any other Party the right not to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that any
other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

(d)Additional Transactions. Parent and the Company will not and will not
permit any of their respective Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire, by
merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity, if the entering into of an
agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation would, based on the Knowledge of Parent or the Company,
respectively, at the time of entry into such agreement, reasonably be expected
to (i) materially increase the likelihood of any Governmental Entity entering
an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.6 Taxation.

(a)The Parties intend to adopt this Agreement and the Merger as a plan of
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter to the contrary, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to not
take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

(b)From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall cooperate with
each other and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, a written opinion of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP (or other nationally
recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) ("Company Tax
Counsel"), in the case of the Company, and a written opinion of Jones Day (or
other nationally recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent)
("Parent Tax Counsel"), in the case of Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent, respectively (each such
opinion, a "Tax Opinion"), dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, 

on the basis of customary representations, assumptions and undertakings set
forth or referred to in such opinion and in the related Tax Representation
Letters, (i) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger will be treated
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
the Company, the Merger Sub and Parent will each be a "party to the
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Each of the
Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel and
Parent Tax Counsel for purposes of the Tax Opinions customary representations,
assumptions and undertakings, substantially in the forms attached as exhibits
hereto (the "Tax Representation Letters"), with such changes as may be
necessary to take into account any change in applicable Law or fact after the
date hereof. The Company will promptly notify Parent if, before the Effective
Time, it knows or has reason to believe that the Company is no longer able to
obtain the Tax Opinion from Company Tax Counsel. Parent will promptly notify
the Company if, before the Effective Time, it knows or has reason to believe
that Parent is no longer able to obtain the Tax Opinion from Parent Tax
Counsel.

(c)After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate in good faith and shall provide
all information in their possession (or in possession of the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' agents or third party advisors) that is reasonably
requested by Parent with respect to Tax matters relevant to integrating the
Company's respective Subsidiaries and operations.

6.7 Access and Reports. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, (a)
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and
Parent's Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees,
properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested and (b) Parent shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford
the Company reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to such information as may be reasonably
requested by the Company for a bona fide business purpose in connection with
material events, circumstances, occurrences or developments with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement (or which were
not previously disclosed to the Company by Parent or its Representatives and
were not known by the Company, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement); provided that (i) neither the Company nor Parent shall be required
to provide such access if it would unreasonably disrupt its operations and
(ii) no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent, or
Merger Sub herein, and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (1) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, would result in the disclosure of any
Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality (provided that such Party shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure), (ii) to permit (or to require the Company to perform) any Phase
II environmental site assessments or other intrusive environmental sampling or
subsurface investigations, including soil, sediment or groundwater testing or
sampling, on any of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything in this 

Section 6.7 to the contrary, the Company and Parent shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of third parties that
are necessary to permit such access or make such disclosure and shall
otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to permit such access or
disclosure, including pursuant to the use of "clean team" arrangements (on
terms reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, as applicable) pursuant
to which outside counsel of Parent or the Company, as applicable, could be
provided access to any such information and pursuant to which such information
shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers,
employees or other Representatives of Parent or the Company, as applicable,
without the prior consent of the other Party; provided that neither the
Company nor Parent, as applicable, shall be required to incur any liability,
take any action that would breach any Contract or applicable Law or otherwise
jeopardize any privilege or protection in connection with the foregoing. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be directed
to the general counsel or other Person designated by the Company or Parent, as
applicable. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.8 Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE
to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares
from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no
more than 10 calendar days after the Closing Date.

6.9 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint
press release, and thereafter, unless an Adverse Company Recommendation Change
or an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change shall have occurred, and except
with respect to press releases and other public statements in connection with
Section 6.2 (to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to Section 6.2), the
Company and Parent each shall consult with the other, and give the other a
reasonable opportunity for review, prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, without prior consultation, each Party
(a) may, subject to Section 6.2, communicate information that is not
confidential information of any other Party with financial analysts, investors
and media representatives in the ordinary course of business and in a manner
consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable Law and (b)
may disseminate information included in a press release or other document
already approved for external distribution by the other Parties. 

6.10 Employee Benefits.

(a)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries to, provide to each
employee who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date (each, a "Company Employee") for so long as such Company Employee remains
an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, (i) base salary or regular hourly
wage no less favorable than the base salary or regular hourly wage provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time; (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities and target
quarterly and target long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are
no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunities and target
quarterly and target long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided
to such Company Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Company
Employees who are covered by a Company Labor Agreement. Additionally, Parent
agrees that any Company Employee whose employment involuntarily terminates
without cause during the Continuation Period and is not otherwise, as of the
Effective Time, covered by, or a party to, a plan, agreement, or arrangement
providing for severance benefits, shall be provided with the severance pay and
benefits set forth in Section 6.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
subject to such Company Employee's execution of a customary release of claims
against the Company, Parent, and their Affiliates. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and assume all obligations under the
Change in Control Agreements and Severance Agreements listed in Section 5.1(h)
of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of such
agreements as in effect on the date hereof.

(b)For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit entitlement
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time as required
pursuant to Section 6.10(a) (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to the extent such service was
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under any similar Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, to the extent
such Company Employee is eligible to participate in a New Plan pursuant to
Section 6.10(a), and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)
Parent will waive any waiting time in any and all New Plans of the same type
as any Company Benefit Plans in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions were not satisfied
or would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each Company Employee shall be 

given credit, under the applicable New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits, for amounts paid prior to the Effective
Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding
Old Plan during the same period for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents as though such amounts had been
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the New Plan.

(c)Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay bonuses
pursuant to the Company\'s annual and quarterly bonus programs to the Company
Employees in respect of any portion of calendar year 2020 that occurs prior to
the Effective Time, which payment shall be no less than the amount accrued by
the Company for such bonuses through the Effective Time. The bonus payments
will be allocated in consultation with management of the Company immediately
prior to the Closing and paid in accordance with the applicable annual or
quarterly bonus plan at the time the Company would otherwise have paid bonuses
absent the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the generality of
Section 6.10(a), commencing at the Effective Time through December 31, 2020,
each Company Employee will participate in an annual or quarterly bonus plan
that continues the non-financial performance metrics set prior to the
Effective Time to the extent such non-financial performance metrics were set
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice or in a
bonus plan of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries.

(d)Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their applicable
Subsidiaries to, recognize and honor each Company Employee's vacation accrued
but unused through the Effective Time, and the Company Employees shall be
permitted to use their accrued vacation in a manner consistent with the
policies applicable to such Company Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e)If requested in writing by Parent at least ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time (or such longer time period necessary to comply with the
Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law), the Company will take (or cause to be
taken) all actions necessary to terminate, effective no later than the
Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, any Company Benefit
Plans listed in Section 6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a
"Terminated Plan"). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
Terminated Plans have been terminated (the form and substance of which shall
reflect any reasonable comments thereto submitted by Parent to the Company)
not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. If a
Terminated Plan is a qualified defined contribution plan, Parent shall permit
each eligible Company Employee to become a participant in an "eligible
retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") and make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or
notes (in the case of participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
Company Employee from such plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(f)Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, will (i) confer upon any
Company Employee or any other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or
will interfere with or restrict in any way the 

rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Company Employee or any Person at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, (ii) constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate
of Parent to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program,
arrangement, policy or contract, or (iv) prevent Parent, the Company, or any
of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 will create any third party
beneficiary rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates, or any beneficiaries, dependents, or collective bargaining
representative thereof, or in any other Person.

6.11 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense, except (a) that expenses incurred in connection with
the filing fee for the S-4 Registration Statement and printing and mailing the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement shall be shared
equally by Parent and the Company and (b) as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

6.12 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From and after
the Effective Time for a period of six years, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each other Person
who, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is or was previously serving as a director or officer, or
fiduciary (including an ERISA fiduciary) of any other Person (in each case,
when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"), from and against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and
other charges) or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary of the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and
under its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other governing documents
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance fees, costs and expenses (including
attorney's fees and disbursements) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder) and provided further that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, in each case to the extent a claim in connection
therewith has been asserted prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, shall continue until the disposition or resolution of such matter.

(b)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.12, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving 

Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

(c)For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained
in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and
agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and
comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement
with any Indemnified Party in effect as of (and disclosed to Parent prior to,
including by way of making a form of such agreement (including a list of
signatories and beneficiaries) available to Parent) the date hereof), and not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would
adversely affect any right of any Indemnified Party thereunder.

(d)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies for the extension
of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies with a claims period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage no less
favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified Parties than the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company expend for such policies an aggregate premium
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable
in any material respect to the Indemnified Parties than that provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement), provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual premium
of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. 

(e)If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

(f)The provisions of this Section 6.12 are intended to survive the
consummation of the Merger and to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(g)The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

6.13 [Reserved].

6.14 Other Actions by the Company and Parent.

(a)Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company and their respective boards of directors shall use
their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as
are in accordance with applicable Law so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate (or to the extent elimination is not
possible, minimize) the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

(b)Section 16 Matters. The board of directors of the Company and Parent shall,
prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to
exempt (i) the disposition of Company Shares, Company Equity Awards and other
derivative securities with respect to Company Shares, (ii) the conversion of
Company Shares, Company Equity Awards and other derivative securities with
respect to Company Shares into Parent Shares or other derivative securities
with respect to Parent Shares, as the case may be, and (iii) the acquisition
of Parent Shares or other derivative securities with respect to Parent Shares
as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act or by directors, officers or employees of the
Company who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

(c)The Company agrees that prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (i) file any registration statement (other
than on Form S-8) or (ii) consummate any unregistered offering of securities

6.16 Financing.

(a)Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the Commitment Papers (including any "flex" provisions) to the
extent required, when taken together with cash or cash equivalents held by
Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds
available to Parent on the Closing Date, to refinance in full all amounts
outstanding under the Company ABL Credit Agreement and the Senior Secured
Indenture and to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 4.2(f), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Papers, (ii) satisfy (or, if determined advisable by
Parent in its reasonable discretion, obtain the waiver of) on or prior to the
Closing Date all conditions to funding and availability of the Financing
contained in the Commitment Papers and such definitive agreements for the
Financing to be entered into pursuant thereto, in each case, that are within
the control of Parent, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Papers on terms
and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent, taken as a whole, than
those described in the Commitment Papers (including any "flex" provisions
contained therein) on or prior to the Closing Date, (iv) enforce its rights
under the Commitment Papers and (v) in the event that all conditions to
funding and availability of the Financing contained in the Commitment Papers
have been satisfied or waived, consummate the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Papers.

In the event any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Papers becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Commitment Papers for any reason and such
portion is necessary to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the
Company ABL Credit Agreement and the Senior Secured Indenture, to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(f) and to pay the
fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing (A) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing and (B) Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
financing for any such portion from alternative sources (the "Alternative
Financing") in an amount not less than such unavailable and necessary funds
and which (1) does not involve terms and conditions that, 

taken as a whole, are materially less beneficial to Parent than those
contained in the Commitment Papers, or (2) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent requested by the
Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing (x) if there exists any material
breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any
party to the Commitment Papers (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination) of which Parent obtains knowledge or (y) of the receipt by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Source asserting any actual or potential
material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any
party to the Commitment Papers. None of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall (without the prior written consent of the Company) consent or agree to
any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of
any provision under, the Commitment Papers or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver (1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Financing to
an amount that would be less than an amount that would be required, when taken
together with cash or cash equivalents held by the Parent and the Company on
the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the
Closing Date, to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company
ABL Credit Agreement and the Senior Secured Indenture, to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(f) and to pay the fees and
expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing, (2) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing, (3) could reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (4) materially and adversely impacts the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Papers; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the Commitment Papers to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as parties thereto who had not executed the Commitment Papers as of the date
of this Agreement or increase the amount of commitments under the Commitment
Papers. Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Commitment
Papers, Parent shall provide a true and complete copy thereof to the Company
(provided that, solely in the case of any amendment, supplement or
modification of the Fee Letter, any fee amounts and other economic terms, and
the "flex" provisions set forth therein may be redacted, none of which
redacted provisions would adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
termination or amount of the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment
Papers as so amended, supplemented or modified) and, to the extent such
amendment, supplement or modification has been made in compliance with this
Section 6.16(a), the term "Commitment Papers" shall mean the Commitment Papers
as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section 6.16(a) shall not relieve
Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available and Parent acknowledges
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not
contingent on Parent's ability to obtain the Financing or any specific term
with respect to such Financing. To the extent Parent obtains Alternative
Financing pursuant to this Section 6.16(a), or amends, replaces, supplements,
modifies or waives any of the Financing pursuant to this 

Section 6.16(a), references to the "Financing," and "Commitment Papers" (and
other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to refer to such
Alternative Financing, the commitments thereunder and the agreements with
respect thereto, or the Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented,
modified or waived.

(b)The Company shall use and cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, investment bankers, agents and other non-
legal advisors and Representatives to provide to Parent, at Parent's sole cost
and expense, all cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating any Financing and any

information customarily provided by the Financing Sources or Refinancing

requested by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.16 (other than arising from
factual information and historical information provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries used in a manner agreed to by the Company) to the fullest extent

applicable Law, without such approval having first been obtained.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
provisions of which the Financing Parties or the Refinancing Parties are
expressly made thirdâ€‘party beneficiaries pursuant to Section 9.8 may be

respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, or of any such document, that
it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all
claims relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT

COMMITMENT PAPERS OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED
THERETO). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as
a remedy (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. The
Parties further agree (i) that by seeking the remedies provided for in this

shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
9.5(c) before exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and
pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Section 9.5(c) or anything contained in this Section
9.5(c) restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter and (iii) not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,

any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Refinancing
Indebtedness, the Commitment Papers or any other agreement relating to the
Financing, the Refinancing Indebtedness or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby shall, except as specifically set forth in the
Commitment Papers, be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflict of law principles thereof to the extent that such principles would
have the effect of applying the laws of, or directing a matter to, another
jurisdiction, and each party agrees not to bring or support any person in any
action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Parties or the
Refinancing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out

THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF
PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR

9.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 3.3
(Composition of Parent's Board of Directors) and Section 6.12
(Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance), Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The Parties further agree
that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 3.3 and Section
6.12 and shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with 

Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the Knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other
than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the Financing Parties and the Refinancing Parties shall be an express
third-party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely on Section 8.5(d),
the last sentence of Section 9.2, Section 9.5(b) and (d), this sentence of
this Section 9.8 and Section 9.13 (together with any defined term used in any
of the foregoing provisions), and each of the Financing Parties and the
Refinancing Parties may enforce such provisions.

9.9 Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause Merger Sub or such other Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

9.10 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

9.11 Interpretation; Construction. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof
will be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or
plural, as the identity of the Person may require. The defined terms contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular, as well as to the plural,
forms of such terms. References to any statute, rule, regulation, law or Law
shall be deemed to refer to such statutes, rules, regulations laws or Laws as
amended or supplemented from time to time, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United
States dollars. References to any agreement or Contract are to that agreement
or Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, in
accordance with its terms. References to any Person include the successors and
permitted assigns of that Person. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the 

degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if." The word "covenant" means "covenant and agreement." The use
of the words "or," "either," or "any" shall not be exclusive. The words
"hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each Party has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that corresponds to
the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of
information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

9.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or
otherwise; provided, however, that Parent may designate, by written notice to
the Company, another wholly owned direct Subsidiary that is a Delaware
corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;
provided that no such designation shall (a) relieve any such Person of its
obligations hereunder, (b) impose any additional or incremental non-de minimis
obligation, or otherwise have any non-de minimis adverse effect, on the
Company or any of its stockholders, or (c) impede or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impede the rights
of the Company or the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

9.13 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in
this Agreement or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered in
connection herewith, in no event shall any Financing Party or Refinancing
Party have any liability or obligation to, or be subject to any action, suit,
proceeding or claim from the Company, its affiliates, or it or its affiliates'
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, controlling persons, agents or
Representatives (collectively, the "Company Parties"; it being understood and
agreed that such term shall at no time be deemed to include Parent and Merger
Sub) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any Financing or Refinancing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Company Parties will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party or Refinancing Party (solely in
its capacity as a Financing Party or Refinancing Party, as applicable) under
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by, or entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement, including
any commitments by the Financing Sources or Refinancing Sources, as
applicable, in respect of financing the transactions contemplated by this
