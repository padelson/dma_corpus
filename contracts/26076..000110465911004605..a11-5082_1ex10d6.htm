 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made and
entered into as of November 15, 2010, by and among Cubic Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" ** _Buyer_** "), ABRX Acquisition Corp., a Virginia
corporation (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), and Abraxas Corporation, a Virginia
corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), the persons and entities listed
Shareholders on the signature pages hereto (each a " ** _Shareholder_** " and
collectively the " ** _Shareholders_** "), and Richard Helms, in his capacity
as representative of the Shareholders in accordance with **Section 13.1**
hereof (the " ** _Representative_** ").

 



 

 **R E C I T A L S:**

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Company is engaged in the business of providing technical
solutions and tradecraft support services to the intelligence community and
the national security community in the United States;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the sole director of the Company and the respective boards of
directors of Buyer and Merger Sub have authorized, adopted and approved this
Agreement and such boards determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
desirable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and the
board of directors of the Company and Merger Sub have recommended that their
respective shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Shareholders, holders of all the outstanding capital stock
of the Company, have adopted and approved this Agreement and the Merger based
on the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that this
Agreement and the Merger are desirable and in the best interests of its
shareholders;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** it is intended by the parties that, prior to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) certain assets owned by
the Company will be conveyed by the Company to Ntrepid Corp. (" ** _Ntrepid_**
"), a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as
described on **Exhibit A-1** (together, the **_"Property Contribution"_** ),
(ii) all outstanding capital stock of Ntrepid will be distributed to the
Shareholders listed on **Exhibit A-2** (the " ** _Spinoff Distribution_** "),
and (iii) the Company will distribute to one of the Shareholders a note
receivable in the anticipated principal amount as of the Closing Date of
approximately $16.7 million from Abraxas Applications, Inc., a Virginia
corporation and an Affiliate (as defined below) of the Company, which is
payable to the Company (the " ** _Note Distributions_** " and, together with
the Property Contribution and the Spinoff Distribution, the " ** _Related
Transactions_** ").

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **A G R E E M E N T:**

 



 

1. **_Definitions._**

 



 

1.1 **Defined Terms.** Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in **Exhibit 1.1.**

 



 

1.2 **Other Definitional Provisions.**

 



 

(a) Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement have
the meanings given to them under GAAP. To the extent that the definition of an
accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with the meaning of
such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement will control.

 



 

(b) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and terms of similar import
are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references
contained in this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and
exhibits in or to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

 



 

(c) The term "including" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with
the phrase "but not limited to."

 



 

(d) Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all genders and
words imparting the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa.

 



 

2. **_The Merger._**

 



 

2.1 **Terms of the Merger.**

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in
accordance with Virginia Law (the " ** _Merger_** "), whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** ").

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause the articles of
merger substantially in the form **Exhibit 2.1(b) **(the " ** _Articles of
Merger_** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the Commonwealth of Virginia and make all other filings or recordings
required by Virginia Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as a certificate of merger is issued by the
Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Virginia with respect to the merger
or at such later time as may specified in the Articles of Merger as agreed
between the Company and Buyer (the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Virginia Law.

 



 

2.2 **Conversion of Capital Stock.** At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in **Section 2.2(b)**, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Portion of the Final Merger Consideration, payable in cash. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " ** _Preliminary Merger Consideration_**
" means (i) $124,000,000, minus (ii) the amount of Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, minus (iii) Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, minus (iv)
the amount of the Expense Funds retained by Representative in accordance with
**Section 13.1(f)**, minus (v) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital as
determined in accordance with **Section 4 **herein, plus (vi) the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital as determined in accordance with **Section 4 **herein. The
Preliminary Merger Consideration as finally adjusted pursuant to **Section 4
**is referred to herein as the " ** _Final Merger Consideration_**."

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Company as treasury stock or by Buyer or Merger Sub shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of Merger Subs common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common stock, $.01 par value,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.3 **Options.** Each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall
be fully vested and cancelled prior to the Merger. As of the Effective Time,
each Optionholder shall have the right to receive an amount in cash (the " **
_Option Amount_** ") equal to (a) the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Merger
(after giving effect to such full vesting) (the " ** _Option Shares_** "), and
(ii) such Optionholders Per Share Portion of the Final Merger Consideration,
_minus_ (b) the aggregate exercise price of the Option, _minus_ (c) applicable
withholding Taxes.

 



 

2.4 **Representations Regarding Capitalization.** The Option Amounts payable
to each Optionholder and the Per Share Portion of the Preliminary Merger
Consideration, the Final Merger Consideration, the Adjustment Holdback Amount
and the Indemnity Holdback Amount have been calculated assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in **Section
5.5**. To the extent the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Options
are greater than or less than the amount set forth in **Section 5.5**, the
Option Amounts payable to each Optionholder and the Per Share Portion of the
Preliminary Merger Consideration, the Final Merger Consideration, the
Adjustment Holdback Amount and the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 



 

2.5 **Exchange of Certificates; Lost Certificates.**

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Shareholder shall surrender to Buyer
certificates of Company Common Stock, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
duly executed stock powers, representing the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) At the Closing, pursuant to the Merger each Shareholder who has
surrendered his, her or its certificates of Company Common Stock, duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, shall receive
cash to which he, she or it is entitled under **Section 2.2**, less (i) such
Shareholders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Indemnity Holdback Amount. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, each Shareholder who fails to deliver his, her or its certificate(s)
of Company Common Stock at the Closing shall receive cash pursuant to this
**Section 2.5(b) **promptly after Buyers receipt of such Shareholders
certificate(s).

 



 

(c) Surrendered certificates shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered
and exchanged, each such certificate shall represent solely the right to
receive, per share, the Per Share Portion of the Final Merger Consideration
(subject to adjustment as provided herein) pursuant to **Section 2.2**, and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay the holder thereof the
cash to which he, she or it would otherwise have been entitled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
providing of an indemnity by such Person, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, Buyer shall deliver to such Person, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Per Share Portion of the
Final Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this
**Section 2.5**.

 



 

2.6 **Effect of the Merger.**

 



 

(a) **Articles of Incorporation**. The articles of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in the Merger to read as set forth on
**Exhibit 2.6(a) **and shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(b) **Bylaws**. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall
be adopted as the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(c) **Directors and Officers**. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements (or their earlier resignation or removal), the directors of
Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the
individuals listed on **Exhibit 2.6(c) **shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation .

 



 

2.7 **Dissenters  Rights**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has
demanded and perfected such holders right for appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Virginia Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (" ** _Dissenting
Shares_** "), if any, shall not be converted into the Preliminary Merger
Consideration or the Final Merger Consideration but shall instead be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Virginia Law. The Company
shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demand received by the Company to
require the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and Buyer
shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demand.

 



      
 

 



 

The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, or as
required under Virginia Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such purchase demand. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares (" ** _Dissenting Shareholder_** ") who, pursuant
to the provisions of Virginia Law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair
value for shares of Company Common Stock shall receive payment therefor (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Buyer shall
pay such Dissenting Shareholder the portion of the Preliminary Merger
Consideration or Final Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which such
shareholder would otherwise be entitled under **Section 2.2** (less such
Shareholders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Indemnity Holdback Amount).

 



 

3. **_The Closing._**

 



 

3.1 **The Closing**. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall take place at the offices of
Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10103 at
10:00 a.m. New York City as soon as practicable, but no less than two Business
Days, following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing
conditions set forth in **Section 10 **hereof (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing), or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to
Buyer and the Company. The date and time of the Closing are referred to herein
as the " ** _Closing Date_**."

 



 

3.2 **The Closing Transactions** **.** At the Closing, the parties hereto
shall consummate the following transactions (the " ** _Closing Transactions_**
"):

 



 

(a) the Company and Merger Sub shall cause the Articles of Merger to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of
Virginia;

 



 

(b) subject to delivery and receipt of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal
as provided in clause (g) below, Buyer shall deliver to each holder of Company
Common Stock such holders Per Share Portion of the Preliminary Merger
Consideration, less such holders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment
Holdback Amount and the Indemnity Holdback Amount, in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a single account designated by the
Representative in writing at least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date;

 



 

(c) subject to delivery and receipt of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal
as provided in clause (g) below, Buyer shall deliver to each Optionholder the
amount (after applicable withholding Taxes) due to such Optionholder for such
Optionholders cancelled Options under **Section 2.3**, less such
Optionholders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Indemnity Holdback Amount, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a single account designated by the Representative in writing at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(d) subject to receipt of the payoff letters contemplated by **Section
10.1**, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company,
all amounts necessary to discharge fully the then-outstanding balance of all
Estimated Closing Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated by the holder of such Indebtedness;

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Buyer, the Representative and the Company shall enter into an escrow
agreement with the Escrow Agent effective as of the Closing Date which shall
be substantially in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit 3.2(e) **(the " **
_Escrow Agreement_** ");

 



 

(f) Buyer shall deliver the Adjustment Holdback Amount and the Indemnity
Holdback Amount to the Escrow Agent which shall be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(g) the Company shall deliver to Buyer one or more certificates, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, together with a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal substantially in the form of **Exhibit
3.2(g)(i) **representing all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or affidavits of loss and
indemnities as set forth in **Section 2.5(c) **in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and each Optionholder shall deliver a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal substantially in the form of **Exhibit
3.2(g)(ii) **in respect of the options to purchase Company Common Stock held
by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such Letter
of Transmittal, a " ** _Letter of Transmittal_** ");

 



 

(h) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and the
Shareholders, all Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses to each Person who is
owed a portion thereof;

 



 

(i) the Company shall deliver to Buyer written letters of resignation,
effective as of the Effective Time, of each of the directors and officers of
the Company requested by Buyer prior to the Closing.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the failure of any Shareholder to satisfy any of the deliveries
set forth in **Section 3.2(g) **shall not affect Buyers obligation to
deliver to any other Shareholder such portion of the Final Merger
Consideration (less such Shareholders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment
Holdback Amount and the Indemnity Holdback Amount) to which such other
Shareholder is entitled at Closing. If any Shareholder fails to satisfy any of
the deliveries set forth in **Section 3.2(g)**, the payment of such
Shareholders portion of the Final Merger Consideration (less such
Shareholders Allocation Percentage of the Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Indemnity Holdback Amount) shall be made after the Closing, promptly after
Buyers receipt of such Shareholders deliveries.

 



 

4. **_Closing Estimates; Final Merger Consideration._**

 



 

4.1 **Closing Estimates.** At least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (a) the Companys good-
faith estimate of the Companys Net Working Capital (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_** ") and Indebtedness (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness_** "), each as of the Closing Date (immediately prior to
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), based on the Companys
books and records and other information then available and calculated on a
basis consistent with this Agreement, and (b) a schedule setting forth the
Transaction Expenses (the " ** _Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_** ").
All calculations of Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses
hereunder shall be made without duplication of any asset, liability, income or
expense between such calculations.

 



      
 

 



 

4.2 **Final Merger Consideration. **As promptly as practicable after the
Closing, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to the
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) a statement (the " ** _Closing
Statement_** ") as of the close of business on the Closing Date, setting forth
the Surviving Corporations calculation of the Net Working Capital (the " **
_Closing Net Working Capital_** "), Indebtedness (the " ** _Closing
Indebtedness_** ") and Transaction Expenses (the " ** _Closing Transaction
Expenses_** ") (immediately prior to giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein), which shall be calculated on a basis consistent with
this Agreement, including, as applicable **Schedule 4.2** and the accounting
principles and practices referred to therein in the same way, using the same
methods, principles, conventions, policies and procedures (including the
methodology used by the Company with respect to accruals and reserves to
prepare the estimates described in **Section 4.1**). The Closing Statement
shall contain a calculation of the Final Merger Consideration based on the
foregoing amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Transaction Expenses. If Buyer does not deliver the Closing Statement
to the Representative by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 60th day after
the Closing Date (such date and time, the " ** _Closing Statement Due Date_**
"), the Preliminary Merger Consideration shall be conclusive and binding on
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Shareholders. To the extent any
actions following the Closing with respect to the accounting books and records
of the Surviving Corporation on which the Closing Statement and the foregoing
calculations are to be based are not consistent with the Companys past
practices, such changes shall not be taken into account in preparing the
Closing Statement or calculating the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness.

 



 

4.3 **Access to Information. **The Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall (a)
permit the Representative and his representatives to have full access to the
books, records and other documents (including work papers, schedules,
financial statements, memoranda, etc.) and shall cooperate with the
Representative in seeking to obtain work papers from the Surviving Corporation
pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Statement and calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Final Merger Consideration and
provide the Representative with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the
Representative) and (b) provide the Representative and his representatives
full access to the Surviving Corporations employees and accountants as
reasonably requested by the Representative (including making the Surviving
Corporations chief financial officer and certified public accountants
available to respond to written or oral inquiries of the Representative or his
representatives). If the Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders)
disagrees with any part of the Surviving Corporations calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction
Expenses or Final Merger Consideration as set forth on the Closing Statement,
the Representative shall, within 30 days after the Representatives receipt of
the Closing Statement, notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement by setting
forth the Representatives calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Final Merger
Consideration and describing the basis for such disagreement (an " **
_Objection Notice_** "); _provided_ that the amount of Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth in the Objection Notice shall not
be less than the amount of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Transaction Expenses, respectively, paid at the Closing pursuant to
**Sections 2.2(a)**. If the Representative does not deliver an Objection
Notice to Buyer by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 30th day after the
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, or if the Representative
notifies Buyer in writing prior to that time that the Representative does not
disagree with any part of the Surviving Corporations calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction
Expenses or Final Merger Consideration as set forth on the Closing Statement,
the Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding on Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the Shareholders. If the Representative timely delivers an
Objection Notice objecting to some but not all of the Closing Statement, those
portions of the Closing Statement to which the Representative does not object
shall be conclusive and binding on Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Shareholders and any amounts not subject to an Objection Notice shall be
distributed to the Shareholders in accordance with **Section 2.2(a)**. If an
Objection Notice is delivered to Buyer, then Buyer and the Representatives (on
behalf of the Shareholders) shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and/or Final
Merger Consideration. In the event that Buyer and the Representative are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within 30 days after Buyers receipt
of such Objection Notice, Buyer or the Representative may submit such
remaining disagreements to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or another nationally
recognized certified public accounting firm as is reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and the Representative (the " ** _Accounting Firm_** ").

 



 

4.4 **Disagreements.** If such disagreements are submitted to the Accounting
Firm, Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with
respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Final Merger Consideration
identified in the Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any event
shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a determination within 45 days
after its retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts in the Surviving Corporations and the Representatives respective
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Transaction Expenses and Final Merger Consideration that are identified as
being items and amounts to which the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Accounting Firms determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction
Expenses and Final Merger Consideration shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by Buyer and the Representatives ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review) and on the definition of "Closing Net Working Capital,"
"Closing Indebtedness," "Closing Transaction Expenses" and "Final Merger
Consideration" included herein and the other provisions of this Agreement,
including, as applicable, ******Schedule 4.2** and the accounting principles
and practices referred to therein. The determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be
subject to appeal or further review (other than with respect to errors in
arithmetic calculations).

 



      
 

 



 

4.5 **Costs and Expenses. **The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
determining the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Transaction Expenses and Final Merger Consideration shall be borne by the
Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of
the Shareholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if the Closing Statement claims
the Closing Net Working Capital is $1,000 less than the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, and the Representative contest only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Surviving Corporation, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding the Surviving Corporation $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to the Representative (on behalf of the
Shareholders) and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Surviving Corporation. In
connection with its determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Lease Buyout Amounts, Closing Transaction Expenses and
Final Merger Consideration the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms of
this **Section 4.5**, also determine the allocation of its fees and expenses
between the Surviving Corporation and the Representative (on behalf of the
Shareholders), which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review (other
than with respect to errors in arithmetic calculations). Any costs and
expenses payable by the Representative pursuant to the terms of this **Section
4.5** shall be paid solely from the Expense Funds.

 



 

4.6 **Adjustments. **Within five Business Days after the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Final Merger
Consideration are finally determined pursuant to this **Section 4**:

 



 

(a) if the Final Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this
**Section 4** exceeds the Preliminary Merger Consideration paid at Closing,
Buyer shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to each
Shareholder and Optionholder in cash an amount equal to the product of (x) the
excess of the Final Merger Consideration over the Preliminary Merger
Consideration, and (y) such Shareholders or Optionholders Allocation
Percentage;

 



 

(b) if the Preliminary Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, then the Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) shall
pay Buyer an amount in cash equal to such excess of Preliminary Merger
Consideration over Final Merger Consideration (the " ** _Buyer Adjustment
Amount_** "), out of the Adjustment Holdback Amount and to the extent that the
Adjustment Holdback Amount is insufficient to satisfy the Buyer Adjustment
Amount, then the Representative shall distribute the entire Adjustment
Holdback Amount to Buyer as provided above and, as provided in the Letters of
Transmittal, each of the Shareholders and Optionholders, severally as to
itself, himself or herself only and not jointly as to or with any other
Shareholder or Optionholder, shall pay to or as directed by Buyer its, his or
her pro rata portion (based on its, his or her Allocation Percentage) of the
amount of such deficiency within five Business Days of being directed by Buyer
to make such payment. In the event that any Shareholder or Optionholder shall
fail to pay the amount of such deficiency within the period specified in the
immediately preceding sentence (a " ** _Defaulting Shareholder_** "), Buyer
may deliver written notice to the Representative setting forth such amount,
and Buyer and the Representative will, within three Business Days of the
Representatives receipt of such notice, direct the Escrow Agent to pay such
amount to Buyer out of the Defaulting Shareholders portion of the Indemnity
Holdback Amount; _provided_ that, pursuant the Letters of Transmittal, the
Defaulting Shareholder shall promptly restore such amount to the Indemnity
Holdback Amount to the extent any funds are so paid and shall remain liable
for such amount in the event such Defaulting Shareholders

 



      
 

 



 

remaining portion of the Indemnity Holdback Amount is insufficient to cover
such Defaulting Shareholders proportionate responsibility for any amounts
properly payable out of the Indemnity Holdback Amount. No failure of Buyer to
deliver a notice of the type specified in the immediately preceding sentence
shall relieve any Shareholder or Optionholder of its obligation to pay its
several portion of such deficiency to Buyer.

 



 

(c) All payments pursuant to this **Section 4.6** shall be treated by all
parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration.

 



 

4.7 **Withholding. **Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Preliminary Merger Consideration, Final Merger Consideration,
Adjustment Holdback Amount or Indemnity Holdback Amount (as the case may be)
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Shareholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. If,
under the terms of this Agreement, such payment is paid to such recipients by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and any required withholding is not made,
then such recipients shall make appropriate provision (and each such recipient
hereby authorizes Buyer and the Surviving Corporation to take such action as
may be appropriate in connection therewith) for payment of any appropriate
withholding Taxes to the Company so that such withholding Taxes may be paid to
the appropriate Governmental Body, and such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
recipients in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

5. **_Representations and Warranties of the Company._**

 



 

The Company represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub that the
statements in this **Section 5** are correct and complete, except as set

separately numbered sections corresponding to the sections of this **Section
5**; however, the disclosure of any item in any section of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all information
disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to which the

Business following the Closing as presently conducted. Since January 1, 2005,

8.6 **Covenant Not to Compete.**

 



 

(a) The Shareholders acknowledge that they have extensive knowledge and a
unique understanding of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, have
been directly involved with the establishment and continued development of the
business customer relations and have had access to all of the proprietary and
Confidential Information used in the business. The Shareholders further
acknowledge that if they or any of their Affiliates were to compete with the
Company and its Subsidiaries in such business following the Closing, great
harm would come to the Company, thereby destroying value associated with the
acquisition of the Company and the goodwill of their business. In furtherance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to more effectively
protect the value of the business so sold, each Shareholder covenants and
agrees that, for a period of five years from and after the Closing Date, (the
" ** _Restricted Period_** "), the such Shareholders shall not, and shall
cause Ntrepid, Anonymizer and the Shareholders respective Affiliates not to,
whether for compensation or without compensation, directly or indirectly, as
an owner, principal, partner, member, shareholder, independent contractor,
consultant, joint venturer, investor, licensor, lender or in any other
capacity whatsoever, alone, or in association with any other Person, carry on,
be engaged or take part in, or render services (other than services which are
generally offered to third parties) or advice to, own, share in the earnings
of, invest in the stocks, bonds or other securities of, or otherwise become
financially interested in, any Person engaged in any business that is
competitive with the Business (a " ** _Restricted Business_** "). Neither of
the following, of itself, shall of itself constitute a breach hereunder: (i)
the record or beneficial ownership by any Restricted Shareholder or Affiliate
thereof of up to one percent of the shares of any corporation whose shares are
publicly traded on

 



      
 

 



 

a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market; nor (ii) the
provision by any Shareholder of unpaid consulting services to Governmental
Bodies in the intelligence and national securities communities in the United
States. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 8.6 shall not be applicable to David L. Gokey,
Brad Joseph Juneau or Rodney G. Smith.

 



 

(b) During the Restricted Period, the Shareholders shall not and shall cause
Ntrepid, Anonymizer and the Shareholders respective Affiliates not to,
whether for their own account or for the account of any Person, provide the
Restricted Business, endeavor to entice away from the Company or Dauntless, or
otherwise interfere with the relationship of the Company or Dauntless with,
any Person that, (A) during the Restricted Period, is employed by or otherwise
engaged to perform services for the Company or Dauntless (unless such Person
has not been employed by or otherwise engaged to perform services for the
Company or Dauntless for a period of 12 months or more) or (B) during the
Restricted Period, is, or, during the one-year period preceding the Effective
Time, was, a customer or supplier of the Company or Dauntless.

 



 

(c) The provisions of **Section 8.6(a) **and **8.6(b) **(collectively, the "
** _Restrictive Covenants_** ") have been separately bargained for to protect
the Business, including goodwill, being acquired by Buyer hereunder and to
ensure that Buyer shall have the full benefit of the value thereof. The
Shareholders recognize and acknowledge that the business and markets of the
Buyer Group are international in scope, and that Buyer is investing
substantial sums in acquiring the Company and in consideration for the
Restrictive Covenants contained in this Agreement, that such covenants are
necessary in order to protect and maintain the legitimate business interests
of the Buyer Group and are reasonable in all respects, and that Buyer would
not consummate the transactions contemplated hereby but for such agreements.
The Shareholders hereby waive any and all right to contest the validity of the
Restrictive Covenants on the ground of the breadth of their geographic or
product coverage or the length of their term. The Shareholders acknowledge and
agree that a substantial and legally sufficient portion of Final Merger
Consideration is attributable to the Restrictive Covenants and the
Shareholders hereby waive any right to assert inadequacy of consideration as a
defense to enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants should such enforcement
ever become necessary.

 



 

(d) If the Shareholders or any of their Affiliates breaches, or threatens to
commit a breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Buyer Group shall
have, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies
available to them under law or in equity, the rights to have the Restrictive
Covenants specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it
being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants
would cause irreparable injury to the Buyer Group and that money damages would
not provide an adequate remedy. The Shareholders covenant and agree not to
oppose any demand for specific performance and injunctive and other equitable
relief in case of any such breach or attempted breach, other than based on a
good faith belief that no such breach or attempted breach has occurred.

 



 

(e) The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Shareholders or any
of their Affiliates against any member of the Buyer Group shall not constitute
a defense to the enforcement by the Buyer Group of the Restrictive Covenants,
but such claim or cause of action shall be litigated separately.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) In addition to the remedies the Buyer Group may seek and obtain pursuant
to **Section 8.6(d)**, the Restricted Period shall be extended by any and all
periods during which any Shareholder or any of its Affiliates shall be found
by a final non-appealable judgment of a court possessing personal jurisdiction
over it to have been in violation of the Restrictive Covenants.

 



 

(g) Whenever possible, each provision of this **Section 8.6** shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Legal
Requirements but if any provision of this **Section 8.6** shall be prohibited
by or invalid under applicable Legal Requirements, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this **Section 8.6**. If any provision of this **Section 8.6** shall, for
any reason, be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this **Section 8.6** but shall be confined in its operation to
the provision of this **Section 8.6** directly involved in the controversy in
which such judgment shall have been rendered. In the event that the provisions
of this **Section 8.6** should ever be deemed to exceed the time or
geographic limitations permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, then such
provision shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

9. **_Additional Covenants of the Parties._**

 



 

9.1 **Further Assurances.** From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

9.2 **Antitrust Notification.**

 



 

(a) The Company and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable and before the
expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than five

transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which forms shall specifically
request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act.
Each of the Company and Buyer shall furnish to each others counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all filing fees
payable in connection with such filings. The Company shall bear any fees and
expenses of counsel retained by it in connection with any such filings.

of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep each
other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from any Governmental Body and shall
comply as promptly as reasonably practicable with any such inquiry or request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, Buyer and

Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of either Buyer or the Company, shall be
limited to outside antitrust counsel only). The Company and Buyer shall each

reference and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that the parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary to cause the Confidentiality Agreement to terminate upon the
Closing.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Shareholders will and will cause
their respective employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors and
other representatives (collectively, " ** _Seller Representatives_** ") to,

Seller Representative is requested or required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Shareholder or Seller Representative will notify Buyer
promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this **Section
9.3(b)**. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver
hereunder, the Shareholders and the Seller representatives are, on the advice
of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal
or else stand liable for contempt, the Shareholders and the Seller
representatives may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that the Shareholders and the Seller
Representatives shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the
request and sole cost and expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

 



      
 

 



 

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information which
is generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of
disclosure. For purposes hereof, " ** _Confidential Information_** " shall
mean any information concerning the Businesses and the affairs of the Company
and Dauntless that is not already generally available to the public, but shall
not include any information directly concerning the business of Ntrepid or
Anonymizer. The provisions of this **Section 9.3(b) **shall survive the
termination of or Closing under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer and its Affiliates will, and will
cause their respective employees, consultants, independent contractors,
advisors and other representatives (collectively, " ** _Buyer
Representatives_** ") to, treat and hold as confidential, and not disclose to
any third party, any and all information concerning the business of Ntrepid or

in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to the Representative
or destroy, at the request and option of the Representative, all tangible

the Buyer Representatives is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any
Ntrepid Confidential Information, Buyer will notify the Representative
promptly of the request or requirement so that the Representative may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
**Section 9.3(c)**. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Buyer
Representatives is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Ntrepid Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt, Buyer or its Affiliates or the applicable Buyer Representatives may
disclose the Ntrepid Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that Buyer and its Affiliate shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain, at the request and sole cost and expense of Ntrepid, an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Ntrepid Confidential Information required to be disclosed as
the Representative shall designate. The foregoing provisions shall not apply
to any Ntrepid Confidential Information which is generally available to the
public immediately prior to the time of disclosure. The provisions of this
**Section 9.3(c) **shall survive the termination of or Closing under this
Agreement.

 



 

9.4 **Publicity. **Neither any Shareholder and the Company on the one hand nor
Buyer on the other hand shall issue any press release or public announcement
(including any broadly issued statement or announcement to employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, _provided_ that, the party intending to make such release shall
use its best efforts consistent with such applicable Legal Requirements to
consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

 



 

9.5 **Use of Name**. The Shareholders hereby agree that upon the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer and the Company shall have the
sole ownership of, and right to the use, the name "Abraxas," "Abraxas

shall not cause or permit Anonymizer or any Affiliate of any Shareholder to,
use such names or any variation or simulation thereof in any business.

 



      
 

 



 

9.6 **Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules.** From time to time prior to
the Closing, the Company shall promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to (a) any matter existing or occurring prior to the
date of this Agreement that was required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedules but was not previously set forth or described therein,
and (b) any matter arising after the date of this Agreement that, if existing
or occurring prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules; _provided_ , _however_
, Buyer may extend the Closing Date for a period of up to 10 Business Days in
order to consider the effect of such supplement or amendment. No supplement or
amendment of the Disclosure Schedules made pursuant to this **Section 9.6**
shall be deemed to cure any breach of, affect or otherwise diminish any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement unless Buyer specifically
agrees thereto in writing. Any such supplement or amendment shall be ignored
in determining the satisfaction of the conditions to closing set forth in
**Section 10.1**.

 



 

9.7 **Employee Benefits.**

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all employees of the Company and Dauntless who continue
employment after the Effective Time (" ** _Continuing Employees_** ") shall be
eligible to continue to participate in the Companys Plans (other that any
stock purchase, stock option or other similar equity compensation Plans), or
other Plans that are not less favorable in the aggregate than those provided
by such Plans as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this **Section 9.7** or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of
the Company or Buyer to: (i) amend or terminate any Plan in accordance with
such Plan or (ii) transfer the Company employees to the Plans of Buyer.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee
to employment, and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at
will" employment except as otherwise provided under a written employment
agreement.

 



 

(b) If and to the extent any employees of Anonymizer participate in any Plan
and/or the Company or Dauntless has any obligations to or with respect to any
current or former employees of Anonymizer (or any of their respective
dependents or beneficiaries), then, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
cause such participation to end (e.g., by spinning off the plan assets and
liabilities attributable to such Anonymizer employees) and shall cause any
such other obligations to be transferred to and assumed by Anonymizer, such
that, as of the Closing Date, the only participants in the Plans of the
Company and Dauntless shall be current or former employees of the Company or
Dauntless (or their respective dependents and beneficiaries) and neither the
Company nor Dauntless shall have any obligation to or with respect to any
person who is a current or former employee of Anonymizer.

 



 

9.8 **Tax Matters.**

 



 

(a) The Representative shall, at the sole cost and expense of the
Shareholders, prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns with respect to
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into
account any extensions) for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date. The Representative also shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to each Subsidiary of the Company which is no longer a Subsidiary
of the Company after the Closing Date that relates to a Tax period which
begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (such period, a
" ** _Straddle Period_** "). The cost and expense of preparing such Tax
Returns shall be borne by each such Subsidiary which is no longer a Subsidiary
of the Company after the Closing Date. In the preparation of any such Tax
Returns, no election shall be made which would reduce the net operating loss
of the Company described in **Section 5.16(i) **hereof, unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements. The Representative shall deliver to
Buyer, for Buyers review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), a draft copy of any such Tax
Return, which the Representative is responsible under this **Section 9.8(a)
**for preparing and filing, no later than 30 days prior to the required filing
date of such Tax Return (including extensions thereof). In connection with
such review, Buyer shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice, to the Companys financial books and records. All
Tax Returns prepared by or for the Company pursuant to this **Section 9.8(a)
**shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice unless
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. The failure of Buyer to
propose any changes to any such proposed Tax Return at least 10 days prior to
the required filing date of such Tax Return (including extensions thereof)
shall be deemed to constitute its approval thereof. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall execute and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
described in this **Section 9.8(a) **which it is required to file and shall
pay or cause to be paid the amount of any Taxes shown due thereon to the
appropriate Governmental Body. Each Subsidiary of the Company which is no
longer a Subsidiary of the Company after the Closing Date shall execute and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns described in this **Section 9.8(a)
**which it is required to file and shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of
any Taxes shown due thereon to the appropriate Governmental Body.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
when due (taking into account any extensions) (i) each income Tax Return of
the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to a Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date which has not been filed before the Closing Date, and (ii)
each income or other Tax Return relating to a Tax period ending after the
Closing Date, including any Straddle Period, of the Company, Dauntless and any
other Subsidiary of the Company which continues to be a Subsidiary of the
Company after the Closing Date. In the case of any such Tax Return relating to
a Tax period or portion of a Tax period with respect to which the Shareholders
have an obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
**Section 12.2**, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the required filing
date of such Tax Return (including extensions thereof), Buyer shall submit a
draft of such Tax Return to the Representative for his review, comment and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The failure of the Representative to propose any changes to such
draft Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the required filing date of
such Tax Return (including extensions thereof) shall be deemed to constitute
its approval thereof. Not later than five days prior to the required filing
date of any such Tax Return (including extensions thereof), the
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to that portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns for which
the Shareholders have an obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to **Section 12.2**.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of any Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the
Closing Date: (i) in the case of real property, personal property, and other
Taxes not imposed on the basis of income or receipts, shall be based on a
daily proration of such Taxes, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, shall
be based on an interim closing of the books of the Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which any Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate as of the close of business
on the Closing Date).

 



 

(d) In the event a Governmental Body asserts a claim for Taxes with respect to
which the Shareholders are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to **Section 12.2 **(a " ** _Tax Claim_** "), Buyer shall
notify the Representative of such Tax Claim within ten (10) days after its
receipt of notice thereof from the Governmental Body. With respect to any Tax
Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Period (other than the portion of any Straddle
Period), the Representative shall have the right, at its own expense, to
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the resolution of such Tax
Claim could reasonably be expected to affect the liability for Taxes of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, including the Company or Dauntless, for any Post-
Closing Period, the Representative shall not settle any such proceeding
without Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably
cooperate with the Representative in contesting any Tax Claim under this
**Section 9.8,** which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon
request and at the expense of the Representative, the provision of records and
information relating to a Pre-Closing Period which are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Claim and making employees available to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer shall
control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to any Straddle
Period, _provided_ , _however_ , that if the results of any such contest could
reasonably be expected to affect the amount of the Shareholders
indemnification obligation to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 12.2(iv), then the Representative shall, at its own expense, have a
right to participate in the defense and settlement of any such Tax Claim, each
party shall cooperate with the other party and there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect to such Tax Claim without the consent
of both Buyer and the representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld by either of them.

 



 

(e) Buyer and the Representative shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates
to, provide to the other such reasonable cooperation and information, as and
to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return, any audit, litigation or other proceeding, Tax Claim
or other Tax matter of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to an event
which occurred during a Pre-Closing Period. Buyer and the Shareholders shall,
upon request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other Person
as may be reasonably necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements any Tax that could be imposed for a Pre-
Closing Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending at the close of
business on the Closing Date (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



      
 

 



 

(f) At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, stock transfer, recording,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (other than any such
Taxes relating to or arising from the Related Transactions, which shall be
paid by the Shareholders, and against which Buyer is indemnified as provided
in this **Section 9.8**) shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the
Shareholders when due, regardless of whether such Taxes are technically owed
by the Shareholders or Buyer. Buyer shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect
to such Taxes, and the Representative shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
the preparation of such Tax Returns. If required by applicable law, the
Shareholders shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and any other
related documents. The expense of such Tax Return preparation and filings
shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Shareholders.

 



 

(g) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company or
Dauntless after the Closing) shall file any amended Tax Returns for any Pre-
Closing Period for or in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that could affect the amount of the Shareholders indemnification liability
pursuant to Section 12.2(iv) without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed.

 



 

(h) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
Dauntless after the Closing) shall make the election under Code section 338(g)
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

9.9 **Payment of Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses** **.**

 



 

(a) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will
deliver or shall cause to be delivered to Buyer:

 



 

(i) a payoff letter from each holder of any Indebtedness, which letter shall
specify the aggregate amount required to be paid in order to repay in full the
Indebtedness related to such payoff letter (including any and all accrued but
unpaid interest and prepayment penalty obligations and breakage costs due upon
repayment) and payment instructions on the projected Closing Date, as well as
the per diem amount to be added thereto in the event that the actual Closing
Date is a date subsequent to the projected Closing Date. Each such payoff
letter shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and will include
customary undertakings to release in full, upon payment of the amounts set
forth in such payoff letters, all Encumbrances securing the Indebtedness
related to such payoff letter and to promptly prepare and file with the
appropriate governmental and other offices such instruments as may be required
to effect or evidence such release; and

 



 

(ii) invoices or other documents reasonably satisfactory to Buyer detailing
the Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(b) The Company and the Shareholders acknowledge that the Indebtedness and the
Transaction Expenses are obligations of the Company or the Shareholders
incurred on or before the Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to make them obligations of Buyer or Merger Sub. Payment of such
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses by Buyer on behalf of the Company or the
Shareholders on the Closing Date is being made for convenience only and the
amounts of such payments are included as reductions in the calculation of the
Preliminary Merger Consideration and the Final Merger Consideration in
accordance with **Section 2.2(a)**.

 



      
 

 



 

9.10 **Preservation of Records. **The Shareholders and Buyer agree that each
of them shall preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
Business for a period of five years from the Closing Date and shall make such
records and personnel available to the other as may be reasonably required by
such party in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by,
Legal Proceedings against or governmental investigations of, the Shareholders
or Buyer or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable the Shareholders or
Buyer to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and
each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby.
In the event the Shareholders or Buyer wishes to destroy such records within
five years of the Closing Date, such party shall first give 90 days prior
written notice to the other and such other party shall have the right at its
option and expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that
90-day period, to take possession of the records.

 



 

9.11 **Company Shareholder Approval.**

 



 

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company and the Shareholders shall
take all necessary action in accordance with applicable Virginia Law to notify
all Shareholders who have not previously provided their written consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the taking of such action by
Shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock by
written consent (the " ** _Shareholders Notice_** ").

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide Buyer (and its counsel) with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any and all materials submitted to the
Companys shareholders in connection with the Shareholders Notice. None of
such information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the Shareholders Notice will, at the time first distributed,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 



 

(c) Each Shareholder agrees:

 



 

(i) not to transfer (except as may be specifically required by court order or
by operation of Legal Requirements), sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise
dispose of or encumber the shares of Company Common Stock prior to earlier of
(i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, except in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) prior to earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, at any meeting of the Companys
shareholders called for the purpose of obtaining the Required Vote and at any
adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written resolution of
the shareholders of Company with respect to any of the following, such
Shareholder shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
Shareholder in favor of approval of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Merger and any matter that could reasonably be expected to
facilitate the Merger.

(d) by Buyer and Merger Sub, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the

**10.1(b) **or hereof could not be satisfied by the Termination Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if such breach is curable by the Stockholders

(a) other than liabilities and obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement, (b) except that no such termination shall relieve any party thereto

announcements, **Section 13.10 **relating to notices, **Section 13.8
**relating to governing law, and this **Section 11.2** shall survive the

12. **_Indemnification._**

 



 

12.1 **Survival. **The representations and warranties of the Company set forth

forth in **Section 6**, and the representations of Buyer and Merger Sub set
forth in **Section 7** shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of
**Section 12.2 **and **Section 12.5**, as applicable, and shall terminate on
the close of business on first Business Day after the date that is the 19
months after the Closing Date except (i) for the representations and
warranties set forth in **Sections 5.1** (Organization and Corporate Power),
**5.3** (Authorization), **5.5** (Capitalization), **5.25** (Brokers), **6.3**
(Shares of Company Common Stock) (the " ** _Shareholder_** **_Fundamental
Representations_** ") and **Sections 7.1** (Organization and Corporate Power),
**7.2** (Authorization) and **7.5** (Brokers) (" ** _Buyer Fundamental
Representations_** "), which shall survive indefinitely after the Closing Date
and (ii) for the representations and warranties set forth in **Sections 5.16**
(Tax Matters) and **5.16(a) **(Employee Benefit Plans), which shall survive
until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
The covenants of the Company and of the Representative contained in this
Agreement which are to be performed prior to the Closing shall terminate upon
the Closing; provided that any claim made prior to the close of business on
first Business Day after the date that is the 19 months after the Closing Date
that any such covenant was breached prior to such termination shall survive
the Closing until resolved. The covenants of the Company, the Shareholders and
the Representative contained in this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

which are to be performed at or after the Closing shall terminate 90 days
after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such
covenant. Notwithstanding anything in this **Section 12.1** to the contrary,
in the event of any breach of a representation or warranty by a party that is
intentional or constitutes fraud, such partys liability for breach of such
representation or warranty shall survive the Closing indefinitely and continue
in full force and effect.

 



 

12.2 **Indemnification by the Shareholders.** Subject to the limitations set
forth in the remainder of this **Section 12**, each Shareholder shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined
below) against and hold them harmless from any and all losses, liabilities,
damages or expense (including reasonable legal fees, but excluding any
allocation of overhead, including any cost of employing their own employees)
(" ** _Losses_** ") suffered or incurred by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), officers,
directors, employees or agents (collectively, the " ** _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_** ") to the extent arising from: (i) any breach of, or any inaccuracy
or misrepresentation with respect to, any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in **Section 5**, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Company to be performed prior to Closing, (iii) any breach
of, or inaccuracy or misrepresentation with respect to, any representation or
warranty, or any covenant or agreement, of such Shareholder contained in
**Section 6** or in such Shareholders Letter of Transmittal, (iv) any and
all Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax
period, or portion of a Straddle Period, ending on or before the Closing Date
(either, a " ** _Pre-Closing Period_** "), including (1) any and all Taxes
relating to the income, business, activities, operations, property or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Period,
(2) any such Taxes for which any of the Company and its Subsidiaries is or may
be or become severally liable under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-6 or §1.1502-78(b)(2)
(or any similar provision under any applicable Legal Requirements) or by
reason of being a successor-in-interest or transferee of any Person, and (3)
any and all Taxes resulting from the Related Transactions, (v) any
Indebtedness, liabilities, obligations or commitments of Ntrepid or
Anonymizer; and (vi) any consent solicitation materials or other information
provided by or on behalf of the Company to its shareholders in connection with
the Shareholders Notice or any actions taken or omitted to be taken by or on
behalf of the Company or the Shareholders in connection with obtaining the
Required Vote; _provided_ that:

 



 

(a) the Shareholders shall be liable for making payments to Buyer pursuant to
this **Section 12.2(iv) **only to the extent that the amount that would
otherwise be payable by the Shareholders pursuant to this **Section 12.2(iv)
**(notwithstanding this proviso) exceeds the amount of the provision for the
specific Tax Liability for which indemnity is sought included in the provision
for Taxes taken into account in calculating Closing Net Working Capital;

 



 

(b) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
**Section 12.2(i)**, except with respect to breaches of the Shareholder
Fundamental Representations or Losses relating to Taxes, until the total
amount which the Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise recover under
**Section 12.2(i) **(but for this **Section 12.2(b)**) exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $900,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** "), and
then only to the extent of any such excess;

 



 

(c) the aggregate liability of the Shareholders under **Section 12.2(i)**,
except with respect to breaches of the Shareholder Fundamental Representations
and the representations set forth in **Sections 5.16** and **5.17(e)** , shall
in no event exceed $25,000,000 (the " ** _Cap_** ");

 



      
 

 



 

(d) no Shareholder shall have any liability under **Section 12.2(iii) **with
respect to any breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation of any other
Shareholders Letter of Transmittal or with respect to any other Shareholders
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in **Section 6**;

 



 

(e) the aggregate liability of any Shareholder under this **Section 12.2**
shall in no event exceed the consideration actually realized by such
Shareholder in respect of such Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock
and Option Shares; and

 



 

(f) for purposes of **Section 12.2(iv)**, Tax or Taxes shall refer to the
amount of Taxes which would have been payable or paid but for the application
of any credit or net operating or capital loss deduction attributable to
periods beginning after the Closing Date or to the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

12.3 **Exclusive Remedy. **Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing, except for the post-closing adjustments provided for in **Section
4**, its sole and exclusive remedy against the Shareholders (including the
Representative) with respect to any and all claims relating (directly or
indirectly) to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the Legal
Requirement or legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law
or in equity, or otherwise, shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in
this **Section 12**; _provided_ , _however_ , that such limitation shall not
apply to claims based upon fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall have no right to indemnification
under **Section 12.2** with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss if the matter
forming the basis for such Loss or alleged Loss shall have been taken into
account in the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital. The parties
hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyers remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including **Section
12.2** and this **Section 12.3**) were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Shareholders (including the
Representative) hereunder.

 



 

12.4 **Claims First Satisfied from Indemnity Holdback Account. **Each claim
against the Shareholders shall first be satisfied from the Indemnity Holdback
Amount. To the extent that the Indemnity Holdback Amount (including the
interest or other income accrued thereon) (a) has been distributed, pro rata,
to the Shareholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, (b) has been
exhausted or (c) would be exhausted if one or more pending claims against the
Shareholders are resolved in favor of a Buyer Indemnified Party, then subject
to the limitations set forth in this **Section 12**, such claim may be made
directly against the Shareholders.

 



 

12.5 **Indemnification by Buyer.**

 



 

(a) Buyer shall indemnify the Shareholders (including the Representative),
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the " ** _Shareholder Indemnified Parties_** ") against and
hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by any such
Shareholder Indemnified Party (i) arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement;
(ii) resulting from any breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement
requiring performance by Buyer or Merger Sub prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Closing or by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing and
(iii) with respect to any and all Taxes of, or attributable to, the Company or
Dauntless, or for which Buyer, the Company or Dauntless may be liable with
respect to any Tax period, or portion of a Straddle Period, beginning after
the Closing Date (either, a " ** _Post-Closing Period_** ").

 



 

(b) (i) The Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
under **Section 12.5(a)(i)**, except with respect to breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in **Sections 7.1** (Organization and
Corporate Power), **7.2** (Authorization) and **7.5** (Brokers), until the
total amount which the Shareholder Indemnified Parties would otherwise recover
under **Section 12.5(a)(i) **(but for this **Section 12.5(b)**) exceeds the
Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such excess, and (ii) the
aggregate liability of Buyer under **Section 12.5(a)(i) **shall in no event
exceed the Cap.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, no Shareholder Indemnified Party shall have the right
to seek indemnification from the Company or Dauntless by reason of the fact
that he or she was an officer, director of employee of the Company or
Dauntless in respect of any claim for indemnification by Buyer hereunder.

 



 

12.6 **Termination of Indemnification. **The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or warranty
or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant expires pursuant to **Section 12.1**; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice (which notice shall, to the extent such information is
reasonably available, specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of
such claim) to the Indemnifying Party. In order to determine the validity
and/or the amount of any such claim, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide the Representative and his representatives
reasonable access, upon the reasonable request of the Representative, to (i)
all books, records and other documents (including work papers, memoranda,
financial statements, Tax Returns, Tax schedules and work papers, Tax rulings,
and other determinations, etc.) relating to or containing information relevant
to such claim and (ii) the Surviving Corporations employees, accountants and
other professional advisors (including making the Surviving Corporations
chief financial officer, accountants and attorneys available to respond to
reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative and their
representatives).

 



 

12.7 **Procedures Relating to Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) In order for a party (the " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any other Person against the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Third-
Party Claim_** "), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party
(the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of
the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in
no event later than 10 Business Days after receipt, by such Indemnified Party
of notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five Business Days after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative (on behalf of the
Shareholders) shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any
claims contained in **Sections 12.2** and **12.3**. Should an Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If
the Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) is the Indemnifying Party,
the reasonable expenses of the Representative incurred in defending a Third-
Party Claim (or any participation in a Third-Party Claim that could result in
Losses to the Representative) shall be reimbursed, when and as incurred, first
from the Indemnity Holdback Amount. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party shall have
elected not to assume the defense of or fails to confirm its obligation to
indemnify for a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). This **Section 12.7**
shall not apply to claims for Losses asserted directly by an Indemnified Party
against an Indemnifying Party where no Third-Party Claim has been made.

 



 

12.8 **Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments**. . Any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this **Section 12** shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Final Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment made pursuant to this
**Section 12** (including, without limitation, this **Section 12.8**) is
determined to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any
Governmental Body, the paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving
such payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of receipt of such payment
(taking into account any actual reduction in Tax liability to the receiving
party) and any Losses incurred by the party receiving such payment in
connection with such Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action,
suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or settlement
thereof, relating to such Taxes).

 



      
 

 



 

12.9 **Materiality. **Solely for purposes of determining the amount of any
Losses (and not the threshold issue as to whether or not there is a breach of,
or any inaccuracy or misrepresentation with respect to any representation or
warranty in any manner that indemnification would be available under **Section
12.2(i)**), all qualifications in such representation or warranty as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect (or any correlative terms) shall be
disregarded.

 



 

12.10 **Additional Provisions.**

 



 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 12 shall be reduced by (i) any amounts that may be recovered by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any third party, (ii) any
insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or source of reimbursement that are
actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (each source named in clauses (i) and (ii), a
"Collateral Source") and (c) the amount of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in the year the
Loss is incurred. For purposes hereof, a Tax benefit will be deemed to be
"actually realized" only to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount
of Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes
that the Indemnified Party would have been required to pay but for payment or
accrual of the indemnified Loss or the receipt or accrual of the indemnity
payment (rather than just creating or increasing a Tax loss carryforward). In
computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, (X) the Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity
payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss, and
(Y) the Tax benefit shall be reduced to take into account any net Tax cost
incurred by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the
receipt of indemnity payments hereunder.

 



 

(b) If the amount of any Losses actually paid to an Indemnified Party with
respect to any indemnification claim is required to be reduced under **Section
12.10(a) **after the date on which the Indemnifying Party pays such
indemnification claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had
to pay pursuant to this **Section 12** had such reduction been determined at
or prior to the time of such payment.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
provided for under any applicable law, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable
to any Indemnified Party, either in contract or in tort, for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages; provided
that the foregoing shall not limit any Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligations with respect to liabilities of any Indemnified Party for damages
that are awarded to a third party by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final non-appealable decision in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

13. **_Miscellaneous._**

 



 

13.1 **Representative.**

 



 

(a) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement pursuant to Virginia Law,
the Shareholders hereby irrevocably appoint the Representative as the
representative, agent, proxy, and attorney in fact for all the Shareholders
for all purposes under this Agreement including the full power and authority
to act on the Shareholders  behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including
pursuant to **Section 4**); (ii) to negotiate disputes arising under, or
relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (including
pursuant to **Section 4** hereof); (iii) to receive and disburse to the
Shareholders any funds received on behalf of the Shareholders under this
Agreement or otherwise; (iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the
Shareholders to this Agreement or otherwise to satisfy any and all obligations
or liabilities incurred by the Shareholders or the Representative in the
performance of their duties hereunder; (v) to execute and deliver any
amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments,
and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (without
the prior approval of the Stockholders); and (vi) to take all other actions to
be taken by or on behalf of the Shareholders in connection with this Agreement
(including pursuant to **Section 4** hereof) and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith. The Shareholders, by executing and delivering this Agreement,
further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Shareholders. All decisions and actions by the Representative shall be binding
upon all of the Shareholders, and no Shareholders shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Representative
shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties,
except those set forth herein, and such duties and obligations shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement. The power of
attorney granted by each Stockholder to the Representative pursuant to this
**Section 13.1** is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not
terminate or otherwise be affected by the death, disability, incompetence,
bankruptcy or insolvency of any Shareholders.

 



 

(b) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement pursuant to Virginia Law,
each Stockholder hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Representative and his agents and other
