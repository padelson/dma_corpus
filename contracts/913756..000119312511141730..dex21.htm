RECITALS

WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed to the acquisition of the Company on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a
tender offer (such offer, as it may be amended from time to time in accordance
with this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares
(collectively, the "Shares") of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01
per share ("Company Common Stock"), at a price of $3.85 per Share, net to the
seller in cash, without interest thereon (such price, or any higher price
offered and paid by Merger Sub in the Offer in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the "Offer Price");

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the transaction, it is proposed that, following
the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"), and, subject to
certain limitations as set forth herein, each share of Company Common Stock
that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be
canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (a)
determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other

interests of the Company and its shareholders, (b) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, and (c) resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender their Shares pursuant
to the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable Law, adopt this
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, (a) determined that the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and Parent, its
sole stockholder, and (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to

Company are entering into tender and voting agreements with Parent and Merger
Sub dated as of the date hereof (the "Tender and Voting Agreements"),
pursuant to which, among other things, such holders are agreeing to tender
their respective Shares in the Offer and to grant to Parent a proxy to vote
their respective Shares in favor of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and of other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE OFFER_

SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 hereof, none of the events set
forth on paragraphs (a) through (f) of Annex II shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Company is prepared (in accordance with Section 1.02(c))
to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Merger Sub commences the Offer, as
promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of initial public announcement of
this Agreement, provided that the Company has so complied with the
Pennsylvania Takeover Disclosure Law (to the extent actions are required to
be taken by it) and is prepared to file with the SEC the Schedule 14D-9),
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange
Act")), the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer
Price. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for
any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject only to (i) the condition that there shall be validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time hereunder),
and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares
then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents at least a majority of
all Fully Diluted Shares immediately prior to the Share Acceptance Time
(without regard to Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been delivered in satisfaction of such guarantee) (the
"Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the conditions set forth in Annex II (together
with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). Merger Sub, or Parent on
behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the right to waive, in its sole and
absolute discretion, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and to
make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously
approved by the Company in writing (which approval may be granted or withheld
by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion), (A) the Minimum Condition
may not be waived or amended, (B) no change may be made that changes the form
of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer Price
or the number of Shares sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer
in addition to those set forth in Annex II, or otherwise amends

 



5  or modifies the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Shares, and (C) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth in this
Section 1.01. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is twenty
(20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (such time, the
"Initial Expiration Date," and such time, or such subsequent time to which the
expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, (i) Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer on
one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business
Days each, for any period up to and including the Outside Date if on any then-
scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions has not been satisfied
or waived in writing by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), until such
Expiration Date on which all Offer Conditions shall then be satisfied or, to
the extent permitted, waived, (ii) Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, without the consent of the Company,
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market applicable to
the Offer, (iii) except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the
Company prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date, Merger Sub (or Parent on
its behalf) shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, up to and including the
Outside Date, until the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the first
paragraph of Annex II related to the HSR Act is satisfied or waived in writing
by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) and (iv) if on any scheduled
Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition is not satisfied but all other Offer
Conditions are satisfied, then Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) shall
extend the Offer on a single occasion for a ten (10) Business Day period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer pursuant to this sentence beyond the Outside Date. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub (or Parent on its
behalf) may increase the Offer Price and extend the Offer up to and including
the Outside Date to the extent required by Law in connection with such
increase, in each case, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the
consent of the Company. Following the expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub (or
Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole and absolute discretion, provide a
subsequent offering period or one or more extensions thereof (a "Subsequent
Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, if,
as of the commencement of such period, there shall not have been validly
tendered (without regard to Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in satisfaction of such
guarantee), and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of
Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of
shareholders of the Company in accordance with Section 1924(b)(1)(ii) of the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "Business Corporation Law").
Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and
pay for, as promptly as practicable (within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) of
the Exchange Act), (1) after the Expiration Date, all Shares validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and/or (2) all Shares validly
tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period. The Company agrees that no Shares
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to
the Offer. Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise

 



6  payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts as Merger
Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Laws
relating to Taxes. If the payment of the Offer Price is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the tendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so tendered be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate tendered, or required for
any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and Merger Sub that such Tax either
has been paid or is not required to be paid. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority by Merger Sub, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made by Merger Sub. Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company (in its sole and absolute discretion), except if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01. If the Offer is terminated by Parent
or Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares
in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly (within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c)
of the Exchange Act) return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf
of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered
Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with the SEC, which
shall contain an Offer to Purchase reflecting the material terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and a form of the letter of transmittal and
other ancillary Offer documents and instruments, if any, in respect of the
Offer (together with the Schedule TO, collectively, together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and (ii) subject
to the Companys compliance with Section 1.02(c), cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in
writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable Law for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents,
as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO
before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments or
communications, and shall inform them of any oral comments or communications,
that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive after the Agreement Date
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or otherwise
with respect to the Offer promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications. The Company and its counsel shall be

 



7  given a reasonable opportunity to review any written responses to such SEC
comments and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

SECTION 1.02 _Company Action_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreements and represents and warrants
that at a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
declaring that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Companys shareholders, (ii) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, (iii) recommending that the Companys shareholders accept the
Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, to the
extent required to consummate the Merger, adopt this Agreement (such
recommendations, the "Board Recommendation"), (iv) directing that
the adoption of this Agreement be submitted, as promptly as practicable upon
consummation of the Offer, to any shareholders of the Company if required to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the Business Corporation Law and (v)
taking all other actions (to the extent such actions are to be taken by the
Company) necessary to irrevocably exempt the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements and all other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby from the restrictions imposed by any
applicable "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder," "business combination" or similar statute or
regulation promulgated by a Governmental Entity, including the provisions of
Sections 2538 through 2588 of the Business Corporation Law and the provisions
of the Pennsylvania Takeover Disclosure Law (70 P.S. Section 71 et seq.)
(collectively, "Takeover Laws") (such actions by the Company Board described
in clauses (i) through (v), collectively, the "Board Actions").

(b) The Company shall, or shall cause its transfer agent, promptly after the
Agreement Date and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested by
Parent or its agents, furnish Parent with an updated list of its
shareholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of shareholders, non-objecting beneficial holders, mailing labels, lists of
securities positions and all other information in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock) and such
assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In
addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with Parent
and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in
or subject to any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan, and to
permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer.

 



8 (c) As promptly as practicable on the date the Schedule TO is filed with the
SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto and including any
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that (i) shall reflect the material
terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) shall include a description of
the Board Actions, (iii) shall include the Fairness Opinion and the
information with respect to such opinion required to be disclosed by Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such
item is applicable) and (iv) to the extent that no Adverse Recommendation
Change shall have occurred in accordance with Section 5.02(d) or Section
5.02(e), shall reflect the Board Recommendation. The Company also hereby
consents to the inclusion of (i) a description of the Board Actions and the
Fairness Opinion in the Offer Documents and (ii) to the extent that no
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with Section
5.02(d) or Section 5.02(e), the Company consents to the inclusion of the Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the
extent, required by applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it
is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel. The Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel with copies of any written comments or communications, and
shall inform them of any oral comments or communications, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company, Parent
and Merger Sub agree to disseminate all of the Offer Documents and the
Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Shares together in the same mailing or other
form of distribution.

SECTION 1.03  _Directors_. (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of
any Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "Share Acceptance Time"), and at all
times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number
of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional directors
pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries bears to the total number
of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including increasing the size of the Company Board (including
by amending the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Company
Bylaws") if necessary), increasing the number of directors, and/or securing
resignations of incumbent directors (the date on which Parents designees are
elected or appointed to the Company Board, the "Director Appointment Date").
After the Share Acceptance Time, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company Board and (ii) if
requested by Parent, 

 



9  each board of directors (or similar body) of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries (and each committee (or similar body) thereof, if any) that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company
Board. Following the Share Acceptance Time, the Company also shall, upon
Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"Controlled Company" for purposes of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c) (or any
successor provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated
with such status. The provisions of this Section 1.03 are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a
matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board and until the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall at all times include, and the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Company Board to at all times include,
at least three (3) Continuing Directors and each committee of the Company
Board shall at all times include, and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cause each committee of the Company Board to at all times include, at least
one (1) Continuing Director. A "Continuing Director" shall mean a person who
is a member of the Company Board as of the Agreement Date or a person selected
by the Continuing Directors then in office; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to less than three (3) prior to
the Effective Time, any remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing
Director, if there shall be only one (1) remaining) shall be entitled to
designate (and shall promptly designate) a person to fill such vacancy who is
not an officer, director, shareholder or designee of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and who shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or, if
no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three
(3) persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, directors,
shareholders or designees of Parent or any of its Affiliates, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.03, including mailing to shareholders of the Company the
information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, provided
that Parent or Merger Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis
all information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors
and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Parent shall supply
to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant
to Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board and, in the case of the
following clauses (i) through (iii), inclusive, no other action on the part of
the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall

Morris LLP, 30 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103-4196,

specified time shall be the same in each document filed pursuant to the

or interest in, to or under any of the rights or properties of Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the

12 ARTICLE III

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE FUND; COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS_

SECTION 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or
any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share that is
directly owned of record by the Company, any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, by Parent or by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 3.01(b) and, except as provided in Section 3.01(d),
the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), payable net to
the holder in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of (x) a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Shares (each, a "Certificate") or (y) any
such uncertificated Shares (collectively, the "Uncertificated Shares") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder or beneficial owner who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the "Appraisal Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
1930 of the Business Corporation Law, including compliance with Subchapter D
of Chapter 15 of the Business Corporation Law ("Subchapter D"), as required by
Section 1930 thereof, shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(c), but instead such holder
or beneficial owner shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Subchapter D. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder or beneficial owner of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with
Subchapter D. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder or beneficial
owner of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Subchapter D or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder or beneficial
owner is not entitled to the relief provided by

 



13  Subchapter D, then the right of such holder or beneficial owner to be paid
the fair value of such holders or beneficial owners Appraisal Shares under
Subchapter D shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(c). The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the Business Corporation Law received by the Company, and Parent shall have
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (in its sole and absolute discretion), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of such demands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no shareholder of the Company shall have any right to seek appraisal of Shares
if such right is not expressly provided for as a result of the Merger under
Subchapter D, including after giving full effect to the exemptions set forth
in Section 1571(b) of the Business Corporation Law, and nothing in this
Agreement is intended to confer any such right in circumstances where it is
otherwise not so required. For the avoidance of doubt, no action has been
taken by the Company Board to grant appraisal or dissenters rights in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Tender
and Voting Agreements pursuant to Section 1571(c) of the Business Corporation
Law.

(e) _Adjustment Events_. Without limiting any of the provisions of this
Agreement, if, between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the Shares
outstanding are changed into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or
reclassification of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price or Merger Consideration (as applicable)
payable per Share and all Option Amounts shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate to fairly reflect the effects of such transaction.

SECTION 3.02 _Exchange Fund_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent at the Effective Time cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer
of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and the form of which the Company has approved (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and the transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of 

 



14  record of Shares shall, (x) upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Paying Agent, or (y) upon receipt of a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger
Consideration that the number of Shares previously represented by such
Certificate or the Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares which are not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if (x) the Certificate so tendered is properly endorsed or is
otherwise in proper form of transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such
payment has paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate tendered, or required for any other reason relating
to such holder or requesting Person, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent and Merger Sub that such Tax either has been paid or is
not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Uncertificated Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered. Until surrendered or transferred as
contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate and each Uncertificated
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the
holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Article III. No interest shall be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Uncertificated Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of cash to
the holder thereof as provided in this Article III.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter, subject to Section 3.02(e), look only to Parent as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration that may be payable to such holders as determined pursuant to
the provisions of this Article III.

(e) _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, Federal or

 



15  other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on
which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_ _._ The Paying Agent shall invest or
hold the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent.
Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of
the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein and in the event the funds
on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has funds
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration.

(g) _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent or the Paying Agent by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights_ _._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, any
holder of a Company Stock Option or any holder of Company Restricted Stock
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Code"), or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, the holder
of the Company Stock Option or the holder of Company Restricted Stock, as the
case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

SECTION 3.03  _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) _Company Equity Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Agreement Date, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions as may be
required, including obtaining any consents, to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (i) each unexercised Company Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall 

 



16  be canceled, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of each such
canceled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor,
an amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding
of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 3.02(h)) equal
to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Stock Option, whether or not vested (such amount, the
"Option Amount"), and (ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock shall vest
in full in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and
the Shares issued thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.01(c). All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be
paid as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, without
interest, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such
payments as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time in accordance
with the foregoing and the terms of the Company Stock Options or the
applicable Company Stock Plans pursuant to which they were issued (as modified
pursuant hereto). Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, except as otherwise
agreed to by the parties, the Company shall take such action such that the
Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

(b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Between the Agreement Date and
the Effective Time, (A) participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those
employees who are participants on the Agreement Date; (B) ESPP participants
may not increase the rate of their payroll deductions or purchase elections
from those in effect on the Agreement Date; (C) no Purchase Period (as
defined in the ESPP) shall be commenced (provided, however, except as
otherwise provided herein, ESPP participants shall be entitled to make
elections in accordance with the ESPP with respect to any Purchase Period
which has commenced as of the Agreement Date); (D) if, with respect to a
Purchase Period in effect on the Agreement Date, the Effective Time occurs
prior to the Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) for such Purchase Period,
upon the Effective Time, each purchase right under the ESPP outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be used to purchase from the
Company whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the
ESPP regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per
participant) at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP or
the then outstanding Purchase Period using such date as the final Purchase
Date for such Purchase Period, and any remaining accumulated but unused
payroll deductions shall be distributed to the relevant participants without
interest as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time; and (E) the
ESPP shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the Purchase Date for the
Purchase Period in effect on the Agreement Date and the Effective Time.

SECTION 3.04 _Company Warrants_. No Company Warrants, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
in the Merger. At the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Warrant that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall be canceled, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of each such
canceled Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Warrant and in settlement therefor, an amount in
cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 3.02(h)) equal to (A)
the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock

 



17  previously subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by (B) the total
number of Shares previously subject to such Company Stock Warrant. All amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall be paid as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, without interest, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time in accordance with the foregoing and the
terms of the Company Warrant, subject to the receipt of a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal, substantially in the same form as the
letter of transmittal contemplated by Section 3.02(b) and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

SECTION 4.01 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except (i) as
disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
filed by the Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in
each case, prior to the Agreement Date and pursuant to the Exchange Act (the
"Filed SEC Documents"), other than any disclosures contained or referenced
therein under the captions "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," and
any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors
or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature (it
being understood that any matter disclosed in any Filed SEC Document shall be
deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Schedule only to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in
such Filed SEC Document that such disclosure is applicable to such section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), other than, in each case, any matters
disclosed for purposes of Sections 4.01(c), 4.01(j), 4.01(k), 4.01(q) (

the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or 

 



18  licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of the Company Articles of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws
and the comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as amended to the date hereof. The Company has made available to

Subsidiaries and the committees of each of such boards of directors, in each
case held since January 1, 2008. The Company is not in violation of any of
the provisions of the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Bylaws.

(b) _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists,

of organization thereof. All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or

(f) _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) The Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents with the SEC required to be filed or furnished
by the Company since January 1, 2009 (together with all exhibits, financial
statements and schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein by
reference, the "SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing, or,
if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, (A) the SEC Documents
complied, and all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed with the SEC after the date hereof will comply, in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable thereto, and (B) except to the extent amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC prior to the Agreement Date,
none of the SEC Documents contained (and none of the reports, schedules,
forms, statements or other documents required to be filed with the SEC after
the date hereof will contain) any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company
is required to file any forms, schedules, statements, reports or other
documents with the SEC. Each SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act,
as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. Since January 1, 2009 until the Agreement
Date, there have been no comment letters received by the Company from the SEC
and relating to the SEC Documents. As of the Agreement Date, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in such comment letters received by the
Company from the SEC. The Company has not received any written notice from the
SEC that any of the SEC Documents is the subject of any ongoing review by the
SEC. There are no amendments or modifications, which are or will be required
to be filed with the SEC, but have not yet been filed with the SEC,

 



23  to (A) agreements, documents or other instruments which previously have been
filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or (B) the SEC
Documents.

 

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the
Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") (except, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC
or other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and consolidated shareholders equity of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and consolidated cash flows for the
periods then ended (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to customary year-end
adjustments).

 

(iii) Except for those (A) Liabilities reflected (or for which adequate
reserves were established) in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of December 31, 2010 (or the notes thereto) included in the Filed
SEC Documents, (B) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2010 and (C) Liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, matured, unmatured, fixed, contingent
or otherwise) (each, a "Liability"). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company is a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become a
party to, any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)
of Regulation S-K).

(iv) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the required time periods. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

(v) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that complies in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act. Such internal controls are designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys
financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the Agreement Date,
to the Companys auditors and audit committee (and made available to Parent
a summary of such disclosure) (A) any "significant deficiencies" and
"material weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting

 



24  which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement,
"significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings
assigned to them by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Interim
Standard AU 325 parts 2 and 3, as in effect on the date hereof. The principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to the SEC
Documents and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete
and correct in all material respects, and the Company is otherwise in
material compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002.

(vi) Since January 1, 2008, (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any material concerns from employees of the Company
any Subsidiary of the Company regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and (ii)
no attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, whether
or not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, has reported
evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees
or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to the General
Counsel or Chief Executive Officer of the Company pursuant to the rules of
the SEC adopted under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events. _ Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, since December 31, 2010, and until the Agreement Date, the Company
and the Subsidiaries of the Company have conducted their respective businesses
in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and there has not occurred:

(i) any Material Adverse Effect; or 

(ii) any action of the type described in Section 5.01(b) which, had such
action been taken after the Agreement Date, would be in violation of such
Section.

(h) _Litigation._ There is no material suit, claim, action, proceeding,
hearing, notice of violation, arbitration, demand letter, or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (including
by virtue of indemnification or otherwise) or their respective assets or
properties, or any of their respective current or former directors, officers
or employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their services or
relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company). Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is subject to any material
outstanding Judgment. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company
has any suit, claim, action, proceeding, claim, mediation, arbitration or
investigation pending against any other Person.

 



25 (i) _Compliance; Regulatory Compliance_. Other than FDA and related matters,
healthcare regulatory compliance matters, labor and employment matters,
employee benefits matters, tax matters, hazardous materials and environmental

4.01(j), Section 4.01(k), Section 4.01(l), Section 4.01(n), Section 4.01(o),
Section 4.01(p), Section 4.01(t), respectively:

 

(i) Each of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries (i) has been operated
at all times in compliance with all Laws and Judgments applicable to the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or by which any property,
business or asset of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries is bound
or affected and (ii) is not in default or violation of any governmental
licenses, permits or franchises to which the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any property or asset of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries is bound or affected other than, in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, failures to comply, defaults or violations which have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Companys
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or Claim nor has any Claim been
commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge, brought, initiated, or
threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, that alleges
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in any
material respect with any applicable Law or Judgment.

 

(ii) Neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries, nor any of its
or their Representatives, acting on their behalf, has, in connection with the
operation of their respective businesses, (i) used or promised any funds for
unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to political activity to government officials,

maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, as if it were applicable at
that time, or any other similar applicable Law, (ii) paid, promised, accepted
or received any unlawful contributions, payments, expenditures, gifts or
anything else of value, or (iii) violated or operated in noncompliance with
any export restrictions, anti-boycott regulations, embargo regulations or
other applicable Laws of any Governmental Entity. During the last three years,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has received any written
communication that alleges that the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
or any director, officer, agent, employee or other Person action on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, is in violation of, or has any
material Liability under, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended.

(iii) Each of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries has in effect all
required filings, licenses, permits, certificates, exemptions, orders,
consents, clearances, registrations, approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Entities and third Persons necessary for the conduct of the
Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries business and the use of their
properties and assets, as presently conducted and used (the "Company
Permits"), and all Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect in
all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of the Companys
Subsidiaries has received written notice from any

 



26  Governmental Entity or third Person that any such Company Permit is subject
to any adverse action.

(j) _FDA and Related Matters_.

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have all Registrations required to
conduct their business as currently conducted, and Section 4.01(j)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of such
Registrations. Each of the Registrations is valid and subsisting in full
force and effect. Except as set forth in Notice published by the United States
Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") at Federal Register, 75:47307, August 5,
2010, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the FDA nor any comparable
Regulatory Authority is considering limiting, suspending or revoking such
Registrations or changing the marketing classification or labeling of the
products of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no false or misleading information or material omission
in any product application or other submission to the FDA or any comparable
Regulatory Authority. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have fulfilled and performed their obligations under
each Registration, and no event has occurred or condition or state of facts
exists which would constitute a breach or default or would cause revocation or
termination of any such Registration. To the Knowledge of the Company, any
third party that is a manufacturer or contractor for the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is in compliance with all Registrations insofar as
they pertain to the manufacture of product components or products for the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

(ii) All products developed, tested, investigated, manufactured, distributed,
marketed, or sold by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company that are subject to the jurisdiction of the FDA or any comparable
Regulatory Authority have been and are being developed, tested, investigated,
manufactured, distributed, marketed, and sold in compliance with FDA Laws or
any other applicable Law, including those regarding non-clinical research,
clinical research, establishment registration, device listing, pre-
market notification, good manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising,
record-keeping, device importation and exportation, adverse event reporting
and reporting of corrections and removals, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(iii) There are no enforcement actions (including any administrative
proceeding, prosecution, injunction, seizure, civil penalty, or debarment
action) pending or threatened in writing by or on behalf of FDA or any other
Regulatory Authority that has jurisdiction over the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances
that would reasonably form the basis of any such action. Since January 1,
2000, and except as set forth on Section 4.01(j)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
received any Form FDA-483, notice of adverse finding, FDA warning letters,
notice of violation or "untitled letters," notice of FDA action for import
detentions or refusals, or any other notice from the FDA or other comparable
Regulatory Authority alleging or asserting noncompliance with any applicable
Laws 

 



27  or Registrations. Except as set forth on Section 4.01(j)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is
subject to any obligation arising under an administrative or regulatory
action, FDA inspection, FDA warning letter, FDA notice of violation letter, or
other notice, response or commitment made to or with the FDA or any comparable
Regulatory Authority. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made all
notifications, submissions and reports required by FDA Laws or any other
applicable Law, including any such obligation arising under any administrative
or regulatory action, FDA inspection, FDA warning letter, FDA notice of
violation letter, or other notice, response, or commitment made to or with the
FDA or any comparable Regulatory Authority and all such notifications,
submissions and reports were true, complete and correct in all material
respects as of the date of submission to the FDA or any comparable Regulatory
Authority (or were corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing). To
the Companys Knowledge, no basis for Liability exists with respect to any
such notification, submission, or report.

(iv) Except as set forth on Section 4.01(j)(iv) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no product distributed or sold by or on behalf of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company has been seized, withdrawn, recalled, detained
or subject to a suspension of manufacturing since January 1, 2000, and to the
Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances reasonably likely to
cause (i) the seizure, denial, withdrawal, recall, detention, field
notification, field correction, safety alert or suspension of manufacturing
relating to any such product; (ii) a change in the labeling of any such
product; or (iii) a termination, seizure or suspension of the marketing or
distribution (including for commercial, investigational, or any other use) of
any such product. No proceedings in the United States or any other
jurisdiction seeking the withdrawal, recall, correction, suspension, import
detention or seizure of any such product are pending or threatened against the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(k) _Healthcare Regulatory Compliance_.

Knowledge of the Company any agent (as such term is defined in 42 C.F.R. §

been debarred, excluded or suspended from participation in any Federal Health
Care Program; (ii) has had a civil monetary penalty assessed against it, him

Knowledge of the Company, any other person with a relationship with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as such terms are described in 42 C.F.R.
§ 1001.1001(a)(1)(ii)) are, and at all times have been, in material compliance
with federal and state criminal and civil Laws (including without limitation,
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)), Stark Law (42

pursuant to such Laws, the violation of which are cause for civil or criminal
penalties or mandatory or permissive exclusion from Medicare (Title XVIII of
the Social Security Act), Medicaid (Title XIX of the Social Security Act) or
any other state or federal health care program (each, a "Federal Health Care
Program Law"). There is no legal action excluding any sealed action, pending
or received, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that could
reasonably be expected to result in its exclusion from participation in any
Federal Health Care Program or other third party payment programs in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries participates. In addition, and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, are, and at all

164 (the "Federal Privacy and Security Regulations"), including receiving any
notices from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office
of Civil Rights relating to any such violations. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a "covered entity" as that term is defined in HIPAA.
The Company has been in compliance in all material respects with federal
and state data breach laws.

customers or others reimbursement coding or billing advice regarding products

procedures related thereto, such advice is (i) true and complete, (ii) in
compliance with the payment requirements of Medicare and other Federal Health

the date such agreement was entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with any such physician.

 

(ix) Neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or Claim nor has any Claim been commenced or, to the
Companys Knowledge, brought, initiated, or threatened against the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, that alleges that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance in any material respect with any applicable
Federal Health Care Program Law.

(x) Each of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries has in effect all
required healthcare-related filings, licenses, permits, certificates,

"Health Care Permits"). All Health Care Permits are valid and in full force
and effect in all material respects and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all material terms and conditions
of such Health Care Permits. Neither the Company nor any of the Companys

complete and correct list of each Company Benefit Plan and separately

plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), or (2) an "employee welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). Neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the Controlled Group Members has any Liability with
respect to any employee benefit plan, Contract, program, fund or arrangement
in the nature of those arrangements described in the definition of Company
Benefit Plan, other than the Company Benefit Plans. The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (A) each Company
Benefit Plan (or a written summary of any unwritten plan or arrangement),
together with all amendments thereto, (B) in the case of any Company Benefit
Plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, the two (2) most recent
annual reports on Form 5500 with schedules attached filed with the Internal
Revenue Service, (C) in the case of any Company Benefit Plan that is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service, (D) with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, each trust agreement, insurance or group annuity contract,
administration and similar agreements, and investment management
or investment advisory agreements, (E) with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan, the most recent summary plan description, or summary of material
modifications, and (F) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals,
handbooks and policies. 

(ii) (A) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable Law
(including ERISA and the Code) and the regulations thereunder and each of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries has in all respects met its obligations
with respect to each Company Benefit Plan and has timely

 



32  made or accrued (or timely shall make or accrue) all required contributions
thereto and paid all benefits thereunder, (B) all filings, reports, returns,

Section 4975(c) of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA) with respect to any such
Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA, where the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
party dealing with such Company Benefit Plan or any such trust would
reasonably be expected to be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code or (2) to the Knowledge of the Company,
breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans
that are subject to ERISA that could reasonably be expected to result in any
Liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and (D) all Company Benefit Plans that
are intended to be qualified for Federal income tax purposes have been the
subject of determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that such Company Benefit Plans are so qualified and the Company
Benefit Plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from Federal income
taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such
determination letter has been revoked nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
has revocation been threatened and nothing has occurred that would adversely
affect the qualification of any such plan.

(iii) Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of the Controlled Group
Members has ever (A) maintained any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA that was subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title
IV of ERISA or had any Liability with respect to such plan, or (B) been
obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is subject to ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is
funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. "Controlled
Group Member" means any employer that would be considered a single employer
with the Company under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

Benefit Plan (including workers compensation) which have not been paid, have
been properly accrued on the Companys most recent financial statements
included in the Filed SEC Documents in compliance with GAAP, other than
Liabilities and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the date of such financial statements;

(v) Except as set forth in Section 4.01(n)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Company Benefit Plan
is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company or one of more of its
Subsidiaries at any time without Liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof.

 



33 (vi) Section 4.01(n)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the Agreement Date, each Company Benefit Plan that provides health or other
welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to employees or former
employees (or any of their beneficiaries) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service (other than
coverage or benefits required to be provided under Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA).

 

(vii) There are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims, arbitrations, audits
or investigations that are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, other than routine claims
for benefits.

(viii) Except as set forth in Section 4.01(n)(viii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event
(including as a result of termination of employment on or following the
Closing), (A) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, or any other payment from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, cause a lapse of repurchase rights, trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation pursuant to any
Company Benefit Plan or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee or officer. Except as set forth in Section 4.01(n)(viii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Company Benefit Plan or other
plan, Contract, program, fund or arrangement of any kind, that, individually
or collectively, has given rise or could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to (A) Sections 280G of the Code
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or (B) Section
162(m) of the Code.

 

(ix) Except as set forth in Section 4.01(n)(ix) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan covers employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries outside of the United States.

(x) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has (i) been maintained
and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A
of the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance promulgated
thereunder so as to avoid any Tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of
the Code and, as to any such plan in existence prior to January 1, 2005, has
not been "materially modified" (within the meaning of Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004 or has been amended
in a manner that conforms with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code,
and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been in documentary and operational
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue
Service guidance promulgated thereunder except, in each case, for
noncompliance that would not result in material liability to the Company or
an employee of the Company.

 



34 (xi) Each plan, arrangement, agreement or contract that would otherwise
meet the definition of a "Company Benefit Plan" but which is subject to any
Law other than U.S. federal, state or local Law ("Foreign Plan") has been
administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms
and operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable Laws.
Each Foreign Plan required to be registered or approved by a non-U.S.
governmental entity has been registered or approved and has been maintained in
good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, and no event has
occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
relating to any such Foreign Plan that could reasonably be expected to
materially affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs
relating thereto in a manner material to the Company and its Subsidiaries as a
whole. To the Companys Knowledge, each Foreign Plan is fully funded or fully
insured on an ongoing and termination or solvency basis (determined using
reasonable actuarial assumptions) in compliance with applicable Law, and the
fair market value of the assets held under each Foreign Plan that is a pension
plan or that is funded on an actuarial basis is sufficient so as to permit
a termination of each such Foreign Plan, in full compliance with applicable
Law (to the extent such a fully funded or fully insured Foreign Plan may be
terminated in accordance with applicable Law), immediately after the Closing
Date without Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
being required to make additional contributions to such Foreign Plan (or
related trust) or to incur any liability with respect to the funding or
payment of benefits under such Foreign Plan. The parties acknowledge and
agree that this Section 4.01(n)(xi) contains the only representations and
warranties in this Agreement applicable to any Foreign Plans.

 

(xii) The term "Company Benefit Plan" means each (A) employment, consulting,
indemnification, severance, salary continuation, change in control or
termination agreement or arrangement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, other
than any agreement or arrangement mandated by applicable Law, and (B) bonus,
pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation, stock option, phantom stock,
restricted stock or other equity-based compensation, retirement, savings,
workers compensation, vacation, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit,
indemnification, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other
employee benefits plan, policy, program, arrangement or understanding, in each
case sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or required to be sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not funded, in respect of any present or former
employees, directors, or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
which are sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to
make payments, transfers, or contributions, or under which any of them has or
would be reasonably likely to have any liability for premiums or benefits for
the benefit of any present or former employees or directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing definition of
"Company Benefit Plan" shall only be deemed to apply with respect to the
former employees, directors and/or officers of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries to the extent the Company and/or its Subsidiaries has any
continuing obligations.

 



35 (o) _Taxes_.

 

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed with the appropriate
taxing authorities all material Tax Returns required to be filed by them and
all such Tax Returns were true, complete and correct in all material respects
and were prepared in material compliance with all Laws. All material Taxes
required to be paid by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been
paid (regardless of having been shown as due on any such return), except for
those Taxes for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial
statements included in the Filed SEC Documents in accordance with GAAP. There
are no material Liens related to Taxes on any assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries other than Liens relating to Taxes not yet due and payable.

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld all material
federal, state, local and foreign Taxes required to be withheld in connection
with amounts owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
shareholder or any other third party. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any material Tax deficiency
outstanding, proposed or assessed against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 4.01(o)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of any audit examination, deficiency, refund
litigation or proposed adjustment with respect to any Tax Return of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreements with any Person

Subsidiaries is liable for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or

operation of Law or otherwise.

(iv) Except for the U.S. affiliated group of which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are now currently members and of which the Company is the common

local or foreign Tax purposes for any taxable period for which the applicable
statute of limitations has not expired.

(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any
outstanding extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax.

(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into, been a
party to or otherwise participated (directly or indirectly) in any "listed
transaction" within the

 



36  meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or any other
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b). The Company has disclosed on its federal income Tax Return all
positions taken therein that could give rise to substantial understatement of
federal income Taxes within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.

 

(vii) No Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company does not file Tax Returns has ever claimed that the
Company or that Subsidiary, as the case may be, is subject to Liability for
any Taxes by that jurisdiction or is required to file a Tax Return in that
jurisdiction.

 

(viii) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of
March 31, 2011, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) set forth on the face of the audited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company as of December 31, 2010 included in the Filed SEC Documents
(rather than in any notes thereto) and (B) do not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for the passage of time through the Effective Time in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing
their Tax Returns. Since December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any Liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary
gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of
business consistent with past custom and practice.

(ix) There are no agreements or waivers extending the statutory period of
limitation applicable to any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for any
period. There is no power of attorney given by or binding upon the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to Taxes for any period for which the statute of
limitations (including any waivers or extensions) has not yet expired.

(x) Except as set forth in Section 4.01(o)(x) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company or any Subsidiary will be required to include

result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) closing agreement (as described in
Section 7121 of the Code) executed on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Effective Time, (iv) prepaid amounts received on or prior to the Effective
Time or (v) intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in
Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of Tax Law).

(xi) None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company owns any real
property in any jurisdiction in which a Tax is imposed upon the transfer of
securities of an issuer having an interest in real property. The Company is
not and has not been a "United States real property holding corporation" (as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, and the shares of Company
Common

 



37  Stock are "regularly traded on an established securities market" for
purposes of Section 1445(b)(6) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(2).

"controlled corporation" or a "distributing corporation" in any distribution
of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 or Section 361 of

attributable to or otherwise imposed on or with respect to any such taxes and
interest thereon) imposed by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity and (ii)
any Liability for or in respect of any amounts described in clause (i) as a
transferee or successor, by Contract, or as a result of having filed any Tax
Return on a combined, consolidated, unitary, affiliated or similar basis with
any other Person. As used herein, the term "Tax Return" means any
return, statement, election, schedule, report, form, or any other document,
including in each case any amendments or attachments thereto, filed or
required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or with respect to Taxes.

trust or encumbered its leasehold interest in any of the Leased Real Property.

condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a

of its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously
provided to Parent (such additional information to be provided prior to
the time such information is provided to such other Person) and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal
regarding such Takeover Proposal. As used herein, the term "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal (provided that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to ten
percent (10%) in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to
be references to more than fifty percent (50%)), which was not solicited
after the Agreement Date in material breach of this Section 5.02, was made
after the Agreement Date and did not result from a material breach of this
Section 5.02, and which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor), taking
into account the various legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the Person making such
proposal, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being consummated in a timely
fashion on the

 



60  terms proposed, and if consummated would result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Companys shareholders, from a financial point of view,
than the Offer and the Merger (after taking into account, if applicable, any
proposal by Parent to amend, or make adjustments to, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(d) or otherwise). The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any
standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and that relates to any
potential Acquisition Transaction (including obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction).
Effective as of the Companys taking any action described in clauses (x) or
(y) above or upon a determination by the Company Board that a Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the standstill and any other similar
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall become null and void and of
no further force and effect to the extent necessary to permit Parent and
Merger Sub to make proposals to the Company regarding adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

(c) From and after the Agreement Date until the Director Appointment Date, the
Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty four
(24) hours and prior to providing any such Person with any non-public
information) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal from any
Person or group or any request for information or inquiry that contemplates
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, which notice
shall set forth the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry and the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed in writing as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty
four (24) hours) of any material change in the status of or material terms and
conditions (including all material amendments or proposed material amendments
conveyed to the Company or its Representatives) of any such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry and shall, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof,
provide Parent (or its outside legal counsel) with copies of all documents
and written communications relating to any such Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry exchanged between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the Person making a Takeover Proposal or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall provide Parent with at
least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of a meeting of the Company Board
(or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board)
at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date that
prohibits, or which contains any provision that adversely affects the rights
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon, compliance with any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

(d) From and after the Agreement Date until the Director Appointment Date,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or
recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal, (ii) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or resolve to or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or
take any action or make any statement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this

 



61  Agreement that is inconsistent with, the Board Recommendation (any action or
failure to act set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (iii) approve or recommend, or resolve to or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or permit the Company or any of its
Affiliates to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere or be inconsistent with,
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to fail
to comply with this Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement referred to in, and in compliance with, Section 5.02(b)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, if at any time prior to the Director Appointment Date the Company
receives a bona fide written Takeover Proposal which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may
at any time prior to the Share Acceptance Time, if it determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee and otherwise
complies with the provisions of Section 8.01(f) and Section 6.08; and
provided further that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company has
materially complied with all of its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02,
and (B):

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to
take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including
the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and a copy of the
proposed definitive agreement for any such Superior Proposal in the form to
be entered into; and

(ii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during
the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

 



62  In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.02(d) with respect to such new written notice. If Parent makes
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that any Takeover
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
entitled to notify the third party (which made the Takeover Proposal) thereof.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.02,
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Director
Appointment Date and solely in response to an Intervening Event (x) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in advance of its intention
to take such action, which notice shall specify the facts, circumstances and
other conditions giving rise thereto, and prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, during such five (5) Business Day period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that an Adverse Recommendation
Change is no longer necessary.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, it being understood,
however, that (x) nothing in this Section 5.02(f) shall be deemed to permit
the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the
extent permitted by Section 5.02(d) or Section 5.02(e) and (y) if any
disclosure under this Section 5.02(f) (other than issuance by the Company of a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) does not expressly reaffirm the Board
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed a Adverse Recommendation
Change.

ARTICLE VI  __

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

SECTION 6.01 _Shareholder Approval; Proxy Statement_.

(a) If the Shareholder Approval is required under the Business Corporation
Law in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section
1924(b)(1)(ii) of the Business

 



63  Corporation Law, then, in accordance with the Business Corporation Law, the
Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, the Exchange Act,
and any applicable rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market, the
Company, in consultation with Parent, shall as promptly as practicable after
the consummation of the Offer, for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, duly set a record date (which shall be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Share Acceptance Time) for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of shareholders of the Company (the
"Shareholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Share Acceptance Time. Subject to Section 5.02(d) and Section 5.02(e),
the Company Board shall recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in
favor of adoption of this Agreement. At the Shareholder Meeting, Parent will
cause all Shares held of record by Parent or Merger Sub (or its assignees, if
any) as of the applicable record date and entitled to vote thereon in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall comply with the Business
Corporation Law, the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company
Bylaws, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock
Market in connection with the Shareholder Meeting, including preparing and
delivering the Proxy Statement to the Companys shareholders as required
pursuant to the Exchange Act and Section 6.01(b) below. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, and secure any
approval of shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law to
effect the Merger.

(b) If the Shareholder Approval is required under the Business Corporation Law
in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section
1924(b)(1)(ii) of the Business Corporation Law, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Share Acceptance Time, the Company, with the assistance
of Parent, shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the
preliminary Proxy Statement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to each of the Company and Parent relating to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall (i) include a
description of the Board Actions and include the Fairness Opinion and the
information with respect to such opinion required to be disclosed by Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act and (ii) to the extent that
no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with
Section 5.02(d) or Section 5.02(e) and not been withdrawn, shall reflect the
Board Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the preliminary Proxy Statement and the definitive Proxy
Statement and shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it and
Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts, after consultation with Parent, to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be mailed to the Companys shareholders at the earliest
practicable time. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable
Law. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel with copies of
any written comments or communications, and shall inform them of any oral
comments or communications, that the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff (including any request by the SEC or its staff for any
amendments or supplements to the preliminary Proxy Statement or

 



64  the definitive Proxy Statement), and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in filing with the SEC or its staff, and if required, the Company shall mail
to its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or
supplement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any written responses to such SEC comments and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel.

(c) The Company agrees that its obligation to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Shareholder Meeting as required by this Section 6.01
shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change.

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary to, afford to Parent, and to Parents officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other
Representatives, access at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice
during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its and its
Subsidiaries facilities, properties, books and records (including stock
records and access to its transfer agent) and to those officers, employees and
agents of the Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access (including the
reasonable opportunity to communicate with the employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries that Parent expects to retain with respect to the
benefits and compensation of such employees following the Share Acceptance
Time), and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as promptly as
practicable, to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, finances, operations, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request, and Parent shall be entitled to undertake environmental
investigations at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (so long as such access (including any
environmental investigation) does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information or documentation (a) where such
access or disclosure would contravene any Law or (b) relating to (y) the
consideration, negotiation and performance of this Agreement and related
agreements and (z) except as required by Section 5.02, any Takeover Proposal
made after the execution of this Agreement (provided that, in the case of
clause (a), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to put in place
an arrangement to permit such disclosure without violating such Law). Except
for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement dated as of January 18, 2011 between Parent and the Company (as it
may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent
shall hold, and shall cause its respective officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all
information received from the Company or its Representatives, directly or
indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No
investigation by Parent or any of its Representatives and no other receipt of
information by Parent or any of its Representatives shall operate as a waiver
or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or
other agreement of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



65 SECTION 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts: (A)
to make promptly any required submissions under the HSR Act with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (B)
to furnish information required in connection with such submissions under the
HSR Act; (C) to keep the other parties reasonably informed with respect to the
status of any such submissions under the HSR Act, including with respect to:
(1) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or
waiver, (2) the expiration of any waiting period, (3) the commencement or
proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or
administrative or judicial action or proceeding under the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act (the "FTC Act"), the Clayton Antitrust Act (the
"Clayton Act") or the Sherman Antitrust Act (the "Sherman Act") (HSR Act, FTC
Act, Clayton Act and Sherman Act, collectively "Antitrust Law") and (4) the
nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be
raised under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act or Sherman Act with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby;
and (D) to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
clearances and approvals from any Governmental Entity and (ii) Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall: (A) cooperate with one another in promptly
determining whether any filings are required to be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained under any
other supranational, national, federal, state, foreign or local Law or
regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other Contracts related to
the Companys business in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby; (B) cooperate with
one another in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers; and (C) not to
enter into any transaction prior to the Share Acceptance Time that would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval or waiver under the Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others
of, and if in writing, furnish the outside legal counsel for the others with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the
contents of) any communication to such Person from a Governmental Entity and
permit the others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good
faith any comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Entity; provided that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns; and (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any developments,
meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Merger. No party to
this Agreement shall participate in or agree to

 



66  participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including
any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to
such matters unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the
HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or if any investigation, litigation
or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced or
proposed or threatened to be commenced challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act or
Sherman Act or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve, and to cooperate and assist the other parties in resolving, any such
objections, investigation or litigation, action or proceeding, and shall make
such proposals and take such actions so as to permit the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, in accordance with
applicable Law (including the Antitrust Laws), including making proposals,
executing and carrying out agreements and submitting to orders providing for
divesting (or agreeing to divest) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Each party to this Agreement shall (i) subject to Section 6.03(c) above,
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for
additional information and documentary material received from any
Governmental Entity in connection with any antitrust or competition matters
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) not extend any waiting period or agree to refile under the HSR Act
(except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto) and (iii)
not enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity agreeing not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent (each, a "Proceeding") is instituted, or threatened
to be instituted challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law and such Proceeding seeks to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction completed by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to avoid, vacate, modify, or suspend each such Proceeding,
including through litigation, unless, by agreement, the Parties determine that

 



67  litigation is not in their respective best interests; _provided_ , _however_
, except as expressly provided for in Section 6.03(c), that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out
agreements or submit to orders providing for (i) the sale, license or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of
any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to freely conduct their business or own such assets, or (iii) the holding
separate of the shares of the Company or any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall limit
a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) if
such party has, until such date, complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.03.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Benefit Plans_.

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier
of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time and
(y) the date on which the employment of an employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who continues his or her employment with the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a "Company
Employee" and, collectively, the "Company Employees") terminates, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each Company Employee with employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits provided to similarly situated Parent employees; and, for the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (x) the date
that is six (6) months following the Effective Time and (y) the date on which
the employment of a Company Employee terminates, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide each Company Employee with (A) at least the same wage rate or
annual rate of base salary, as applicable, as was provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) an opportunity to
earn an amount of ordinary course annual performance bonus and commission
opportunities (not including equity or equity related-related incentive
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the amount
of ordinary course annual bonus and commission opportunities that were
available to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation (or
any of their respective Affiliates) shall be under any obligation to either
(1) retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (2) retain any Company Benefit Plan, other than as required by
applicable Law; and  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , to the extent that,
prior to the Effective Time, the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
named on Section 6.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the
Agreement Date enter into offer letters regarding their employment (including
compensation and benefits) after the Effective Time, each such offer letter
shall supersede this Section 6.04(a) with respect to the employee party to
such offer letter. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub have provided notice to
Company and/or its Subsidiaries of any actual or anticipated actions by Parent
and/or Merger Sub that would give rise to an obligation on the part of Company
and/or its Subsidiaries to provide notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, as amended, or any similar state or local law.

 



68 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries excluding both
any retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and any equity compensation arrangement maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries but including any paid time off, vacation and
severance pay arrangements (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
of the Company Employees will participate effective after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all
service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be (including service with any other predecessor employer of
the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with such other
predecessor employer is, or would have been, recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary), for purposes of determining vesting and eligibility (but not for
(i) purposes of early retirement subsidies under any Parent Benefit Plan that
is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii) benefit accrual purposes in any
Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

 

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to (i) recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and (ii) waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively at work requirements and waiting periods under any Parent Benefit
Plan that is a welfare benefit plan and in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan(s) immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that nothing in
this Section 6.04(c) shall obligate Parent to provide any benefit under any
Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that it did not provide
under such plan as of the Effective Time.

 

(d) The Company shall terminate all cash or deferred arrangements within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "401(k) Plans") sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by the Company, effective not later than (x) if
the Merger is effected by way of a Short Form Merger, the day immediately
preceding the Share Acceptance Time or (y) if Shareholder Approval is
required under the Business Corporation Law in order to consummate the Merger
other than pursuant to Section 1924(b)(1)(ii) of the Business Corporation Law,
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (in either case, the "401(k)
Plan Termination Date"). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to a resolution of the
Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding 401(k) Plan
Termination Date.

 



69 (e) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 6.04 and in Sections 4.01(l) and (n)
with respect to Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(i) in any other Person, including any Company Employees, former Company
Employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates. No provision of
this Section 6.04 or Sections 4.01(l) or (n) shall constitute an amendment to
any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan, policy
agreement or arrangement of Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates.

SECTION 6.05 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 16") of Shares
or Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement, and the Offer and the
Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

 

SECTION 6.06 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board which
shall, at the time of such approval, consist entirely of independent directors
as such term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules)
will take all such steps as may be required to cause each
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or its

SECTION 6.07 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) Parent agrees
that all rights to indemnification of and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the Agreement Date, a director or officer of the Company (each, an
"Indemnified Party") to the extent that such Persons are entitled to such
rights pursuant to and as provided in the Company Articles of Incorporation,
the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company (a true and complete copy of which has been made
available to Parent), in each case, as in effect on the Agreement Date, shall
remain in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time (or in the case of any indemnification agreement providing for
a longer period, until the expiration of the rights in accordance with the
terms of such indemnification agreement). Such rights shall survive the Merger
and shall, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (or in the
case of any indemnification agreement providing for a longer period, until
the expiration of the rights in accordance with the terms of such
indemnification agreement), not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such

 



70  Indemnified Party without the prior consent of the affected Indemnified
Party. If written notice of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.07 has been given prior to the expiration of the six (6) year (or
longer) period referenced above, then no amendment, repeal or modification of
this Section 6.07 shall adversely affect the Indemnified Partys rights in
respect of such claim.

 

(b) Parent shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect, for a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers
liability insurance policy that is in effect at the Agreement Date (the
"Current DandO Policy") covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are covered by the Current DandO Policy
as of the Effective Time, or (ii) obtain, in consultation with the Company, a
prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, with respect to those
persons who are covered by the Current DandO Policy as of the Effective Time on
terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to such
indemnified persons than those of the Current DandO Policy; _provided_ that in
no event shall the aggregate costs of such insurance policies exceed in any
one (1) year during the six (6) years after the Effective Time one-hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for such
purpose with respect to 2010 (which aggregate premiums with respect to 2010
are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $230,000), it being
understood that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be
obligated to purchase such coverage, with respect to each year during such six
(6) year period, as may be obtained for such one-hundred fifty percent (150%)
annual amount; _provided_ _further_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company, so long
as such policies have terms with respect to coverage and amounts no
less favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the Current DandO
Policy.

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, or if
Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.07.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.07 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. On and after the Share Acceptance Time, the
provisions of this Section 6.07 may not be amended in a manner adverse to any
Indemnified Party without his or her prior consent.

 



71 SECTION 6.08 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as provided elsewhere in this Section 6.08, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

8.01(e), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
within one (1) Business Day following the date of such termination of this
Agreement;

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(f), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee

(iii) In the event that, prior to the date of termination of this Agreement
(but in no event later than the Share Acceptance Time), a Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly made to the Company or shall have been made directly
to the shareholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become
publicly known, or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to
make a Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional) and (A) thereafter this

Section 8.01(b)(i), (2) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(ii) or (3) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) based on a willful
breach of the Companys covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement
and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement to consummate or consummates an Acquisition
Transaction, then the Company shall pay Parent an aggregate fee equal to the
Company Termination Fee on the earlier of the date of entry into a definitive
agreement or the date of consummation referred to above. For purposes of this
Section 6.08(b)(iii), the term "Acquisition Transaction" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(a)(i), except that all
references to ten percent (10%) therein shall be deemed to be references to
fifty percent (50%).

immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 6.08, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with collection under and enforcement of this Section
6.08 (only if and 

 



72  to the extent such collection and enforcement actions are determined in
Parents favor), together with interest on the amount of the Company

announcement may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system and except for any matters referred to in Section 5.02, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent required, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party. The Company, Merger Sub and Parent agree that the Company,

becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, then the Company

SECTION 9.04 _Consents and Approvals_ _._ For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

SECTION 9.05 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_ _._ This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Company Disclosure Schedule), the Confidentiality
Agreement and any agreements entered into contemporaneously herewith (a)
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, provided
that

 



82  the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (provided that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede
any conflicting provision of the Confidentiality Agreement) and (b) are not
intended to and do not confer upon any Person other than the parties any legal
or equitable rights or remedies, other than the provisions set forth in
Section 6.07 (from and after the Effective Time), whether as third party
beneficiaries or otherwise.

SECTION 9.06 _GOVERNING LAW_ _._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT
WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THE BUSINESS
CORPORATION LAW ARE APPLICABLE HERETO.

 

SECTION 9.07 _Assignment_ _._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub may assign, in its
sole and absolute discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent. No assignment (including an assignment to which
the Company has consented) shall release Parent or Merger Sub of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.08 _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that until
such time as this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the provisions
of Section 8.01, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware or any other competent court of the State of Delaware
(collectively, the "Delaware Courts"), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The pursuit
of specific enforcement by either party will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which
such party may be entitled.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Courts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection

 



83  herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, (ii) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any Delaware Court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any such action or proceeding in any court other than the Delaware
Courts, (iv) agrees that any Claim in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any Delaware Court, (v) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action
or proceeding in any Delaware Court and (vi) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any Delaware Court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.02. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.08(c).

SECTION 9.09  _Severability_ _._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Interpretation_ _._ When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
a Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

ambiguity or question of intention or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.11 _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or portable document format (.PDF)), all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become

parties and delivered to the other parties.

of Company Common Stock after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the
restriction referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered Shares if

Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or impose any
limitation, restriction or prohibition on the ability of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct its business or own such
assets, other than restrictions, prohibitions or limitations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) impose material
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries effectively to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including
the right to vote any Shares acquired or owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Company or (iv) require divestiture by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of
any Shares of Company Common Stock;

(b) There shall be any Restraint or Law enacted, entered, enforced or
promulgated by any Government Entity of competent jurisdiction applicable to

to in clauses (i) through (iv) of paragraph (a) above;

(c) The Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform or comply
in any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements under the
Agreement to be

shall fail to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the Agreement
Date and at and as of such time on or after the Agreement Date as though made
at and as of such time, except for representations and warranties that relate
to a specific date or time (which need only be so true and correct as of such
date or time); and (ii) any other representation or warranty of the Company
contained in the Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding clause
(i)) (without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers set forth therein) shall fail to be true
and correct in all respects at and as of the Agreement Date and at and as of
such time on or after the Agreement Date as though made at and as of such
time, except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific date
or time (which need only be so true and correct as of such date or time) and,
in the case of this clause (ii) only, except where the failure to be so true
and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
