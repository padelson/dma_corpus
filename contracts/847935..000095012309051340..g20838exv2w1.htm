RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have unanimously approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and have determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective stockholders; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve the Merger; 

   

 WHEREAS, the transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company and the satisfaction of certain other conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain beneficial owners (the " _Rollover Holders_ ") of Common Stock are entering into Exchange Agreements (the " _Exchange Agreements_ "), pursuant to which the Rollover Holders are agreeing, among other things, to contribute the portion of their Common Stock set forth therein (such shares, collectively, the " _Rollover Shares_ ") to Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger; and 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a Voting Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the " _Voting Agreement_ "). 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.01 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.03_), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, (ii) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and (iii) the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ". 

  

 1.02 _Closing_. Subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Alston and Bird LLP, 90 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10016, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date most promptly practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (which can be satisfied prior to Closing), but in no event later than the third (3rd) business day following such date or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Merger Sub may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 1.03 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws; provided that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Allion Healthcare, Inc." 

   

 (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

   

 1.06 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their 

   ##### 

  

    

respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal. 

  

ARTICLE 2 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB  

  

 2.01 _Effect on Shares of Company Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Common Stock of the Company_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.04_), and (ii) those shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_) shall be converted into the right to receive Six Dollars and Sixty Cents ($6.60) in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder of such shares of Common Stock, without interest or dividends, less applicable withholding Taxes, in the manner provided in _Section 2.05_. All such shares of Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Rollover Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover Holders shall contribute the Rollover Shares to Parent pursuant to the Exchange Agreements. Subsequent to the receipt of the Rollover Shares from the Rollover Holders, such Rollover Shares shall automatically be canceled, by virtue of the Merger, in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_ below. 

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries as treasury stock or otherwise or owned by Merger Sub or Parent (including, without limitation, the Rollover Shares) or any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange for such shares of Common Stock. 

   

 2.02 _Effect on Shares of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of Merger Sub Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). Each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented 

   ##### 

  

    

issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to
represent the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. 

  

 2.03 _Effect on Restricted Stock, Options and Warrants_. 

  

 (a) _Restricted Stock_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to provide that each outstanding Restricted Stock Award, the restrictions of which have not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and the holder of the resultant shares of Common Stock thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ for such shares. 

   

 (b) _Options_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to provide that each Option shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Holders of the Options shall be given the opportunity to exercise their Options, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and thereby to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock subject to such exercised Options pursuant to _Section 2.01_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any Option, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not exercised pursuant to the preceding sentence and that has a per-share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration (each, a " _Cash-Pay Option_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Cash-Pay Option multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Cash-Pay Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the " _Option Consideration_ "), payable to the holder of such Cash-Pay Option, without dividends or interest, less applicable withholding Taxes, in the manner provided in this _Section 2.03(b)_. All such Cash-Pay Options, when so converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a Certificate representing a Cash-Pay Option shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Cash-Pay Options, except the right to receive the Option Consideration. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to holders of Cash-Pay Options the Option Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. Each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that has a per-share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled, and each holder of a Certificate representing such canceled Option shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Option and shall not be entitled to receive any payment with respect thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each outstanding unexercised option to purchase shares of Common Stock, whether or not then vested or fully exercisable, granted to any current or former employee, director, consultant or advisor of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other person, whether under any stock option plan or otherwise (including, without limitation, under the Companys 1998 Stock Option Plan and Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ")). 

   

 (c) _Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (" _Warrants_ "), each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective 

    ##### 

  

    

Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable in accordance with its terms,
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Warrant multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price of such Warrant, with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded to the nearest cent (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "),
payable to the holder of such Warrant, without dividends or interest, less
applicable withholding Taxes, in the manner provided in this _Section
2.03(c)_. All such Warrants, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing Warrants shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Warrants, except the right to receive the Warrant
Consideration. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to holders of
Warrants the Warrant Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Effectuation_. The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 2.03_ to the extent that such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable Stock Plans and related award agreements. The Company shall take such actions as are necessary or appropriate so that, as of the Effective Time, the Stock Plans shall be terminated. 

   

 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with the DGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ hereof, but shall represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company. The Company shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 2.05 _Exchange of Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the " _Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging (other than the Rollover Shares) (i) certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Common Stock for the aggregate Merger Consideration, or (ii) shares of uncertificated Common Stock 

    ##### 

  

    

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") for the aggregate Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Deposit of Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall supply or cause to be supplied for the account of the Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Common Stock and for exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.05_, the aggregate consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_. 

   

 (c) _Notice of Merger_. Promptly, but in no event later than five (5) business days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Agent to mail to each holder of record of certificates or other instruments that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or Uncertificated Shares (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares to the Agent, and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or transferring Uncertificated Shares and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

   

 (d) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon surrender to the Agent of a Certificate or transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_) shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, within ten (10) business days after such surrender or transfer, cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares and (ii) the Merger Consideration, which shall be paid by Agent by check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such holder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or transfer of any Uncertificated Shares. If the consideration provided for herein is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Shares is registered, the surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Shares shall be properly endorsed, accompanied by appropriate stock powers or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or the Uncertificated Shares, or that such person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Agent will issue, in exchange for such affidavit, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Agent to deliver to 

    ##### 

  

    

it any funds that had been made available to the Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Common Stock (including, without limitation, all interest and
other income received by the Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to any consideration payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Common Stock, Options or Warrants, for any consideration delivered in respect
of such Common Stock, Options or Warrants to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Common Stock, Options or Warrants pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (h) _Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock on the records of the Company. 

   

 (i) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and Warrant Consideration shall each be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction with respect to the Common Stock occurring or having a record date or effective date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time. 

   

 2.06 _Phantom Stock Units_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing, Merger Sub shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a cash-settled phantom stock unit granted by the Company and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Phantom Stock Unit_ "), whether or not then vested in accordance with its terms, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Phantom Stock Units held by such holder and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Phantom Stock Unit Consideration_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by such holder at least three (3) business days prior to Closing. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Phantom Stock Unit Consideration. 

   

 (b) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Phantom Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with 

    ##### 

  

    

respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over, or caused to be paid over, to the
appropriate taxing authority by Merger Sub, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder of Phantom
Stock Units. 

   

 (c) At the Closing, Merger Sub shall also pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a Phantom Stock Unit, an amount in cash equal to the Gross Up Payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by such holder at least three (3) business days prior to Closing. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Gross Up Payment payable on such Phantom Stock Units. 

   

 (d) When the Phantom Stock Unit Consideration and the Gross Up Payment have been paid, each holder of a certificate or certificates representing Phantom Stock Units shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Phantom Stock Units, except for the provisions of such certificates as shall, by their terms, survive payment of the Phantom Stock Units, including provisions with respect to any additional payment subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Phantom Stock Unit Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction with respect to the Common Stock occurring or having a record date or effective date between the date of this Agreement and the Closing. 

   

 2.07 _Notes_. At the Closing, Merger Sub shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a promissory note outstanding immediately prior to the Closing that is listed on _Section 2.07_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Note_ "), whether or not then due and payable in accordance with its terms, an amount in cash equal to the principal plus accrued interest on such Note (the " _Note Consideration_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by such Note holder at least three (3) business days prior to Closing. All such Notes, when so paid, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a Note shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Note.

Bayside Debt and LBO Fund II, __ L.P. (the " _Investor_ "), dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which the Investor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to provide equity financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein for the purpose of consummating the Transactions. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified and the commitments set forth in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

contingency to the availability of the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in _Article 3_, as of the date hereof, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term or condition of the Commitment Letters. Parent is not aware of any
fact, occurrence or condition that would reasonably be expected to make any
of the assumptions, statements, representations or warranties therein
inaccurate in any material respect or that would reasonably be expected to
cause the commitments provided in the Commitment Letters to be terminated or
ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. Assuming
the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 3_, as of the date hereof, Parent has no Knowledge of any event
that would be reasonably likely to cause it or Merger Sub to be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
it contained in the Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger Sub have paid any
and all commitment and other fees that have been incurred and are due and
payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the Commitment
Letters. The Limited Guarantee constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Investor, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms (except to the extent its enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equitable
principles). 

   

 4.10 _Solvency_. Parent and Merger Sub are not entering into the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company.

Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the Stockholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or the date of the Stockholders Meeting is postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that it shall use its best efforts to implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Stockholders Meeting as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) The Company Board shall (i) make the Board Recommendation, (ii) include in the Proxy Statement the Board Recommendation, and (iii) not withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Stockholders Meeting the Company Board may withdraw, change or modify the Board Recommendation only (x) in accordance with _Section 5.09(b)_ or (y) in response to an Intervening Event (it being agreed and understood that the Company Board may only withdraw, change, or modify the Board Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that, in light of such Intervening Event, the withdrawal or modification of the Board Recommendation is required in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to withdraw, change or modify the Board Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event unless the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) business days before taking such action, of its intention to do so, together with a description of the Intervening Event, and, during such three (3) business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner such that such withdraw, change or modification of the Board Recommendation would no longer reasonably be required by the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law. 

   

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement and in connection with the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall (i) promptly (but in any event within twenty (20) days after the date hereof) prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC and thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as practicable (but in any event within ten (10) days after clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement or a determination by the SEC not to review the Proxy Statement) the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials required in connection with such meeting and, if necessary to comply with applicable securities Laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented 

   ##### 

  

   

proxy material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies,
(ii) notify Merger Sub and Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Merger Sub and Parent copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC, (iii)
give Merger Sub and Parent and their counsel the opportunity to review the
Proxy Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC and give Merger Sub and
Parent and their counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and
supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed
with, or sent to, the SEC, and (iv) subject to _Section 5.02(c)_ and
the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement as provided in _Section
5.09(b)_, use its best efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by its
stockholders of this Agreement and the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub will use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Company all readily
available information reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall include all material disclosure
relating to the Financial Advisor (including the amount of fees and other
considerations the Financial Advisor will receive upon consummation of the
Merger, and the conditions for the payment of such fees and
other considerations), the opinion referred to in _Section 3.21_ and the
basis for rendering such opinion. The Company may, if it has complied with
the provisions of _Section 5.09_ and this  _Section 5.02_, as applicable,
and it receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) that it
reasonably expects would result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in
_Section 5.09(g)_ ) or reasonably believes that an Intervening Event may have
occurred, delay the mailing of the Proxy Statement or the holding of the
Stockholders Meeting, in each case, for such time (but in no event more than
ten (10) business days) as is necessary for the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) to consider such Acquisition Proposal or Intervening
Event and to determine the effect, if any, on the Board Recommendation. 

   

 5.03 _Filings and Consents_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto (i) shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in determining which filings are required to be made by each party prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained by each party prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental Authorities or other third parties in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other parties hereto in timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and waivers required to be made and obtained by the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives to) consult and fully cooperate with and provide assistance to each other in seeking early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or any foreign merger control or competition Laws, if applicable, and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay consummation of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.03_, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall knowingly impede or delay the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement not to consummate the Transactions with the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or any similar foreign agency responsible for overseeing merger control or competition Laws, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which 

   ##### 

  

 

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to making any
application to or filing with any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement, each party shall provide the other party with drafts
thereof (excluding any confidential information included therein) and afford
the other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts. Each of
the Company and Parent shall bear one half of the fees of any required filing
to be made with any Governmental Authorities in connection with
the Transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may withhold (i) any document or information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) information that, if disclosed, would violate an attorney-client or other privilege or might constitute a waiver of rights as to attorney work product or attorney-client privilege, or (iii) information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by Law, such as portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by the Companys counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust compliance questions for such party (or any of its affiliates). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent and Merger Sub as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such information without waiving an applicable privilege or causing a violation or default under any contract or applicable Law or giving any third party a right to terminate or accelerate the rights under any contract. Unless otherwise required by Law, each of Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause the Parent Representatives to, hold any such information in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below).

reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any Subsidiary or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any Subsidiary. 

   

 5.18 _Maintenance of Commitments_. Not in limitation of its obligations under  _Section 5.08_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms not materially less favorable to Parent or otherwise acceptable to Parent, (b) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements and in the Commitment Letters and (c) consummate the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters at or prior to the Closing. If all conditions to the Commitment Letters (other than the availability of funding contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter) have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing such financing under the Commitment Letters to fund such financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action to cause such Lenders providing such financing to fund such financing). If any portion of such financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms substantially similar to those contained in the applicable Commitment Letter, or on terms substantially similar to those then prevailing in the applicable capital markets (so long as such terms are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub as the terms set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the commitment letter evidencing such debt or equity commitments shall also be referred to herein as a " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " or " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ", as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall deliver to the Company a copy of any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or supplement to a Commitment Letter to the Company at least three (3) business days prior to the proposed execution of the same. Parent shall not enter into any amendment, modification, waiver or supplement to a Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification, waiver or supplement (i) imposes additional conditions precedent or other contingencies to the funding obligations thereunder, (ii) reduces the amount of the financing committed thereunder to an amount that, when combined with the amounts committed pursuant to the other Commitment Letters, would be insufficient to consummate the Transactions or (iii) would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing Date or to make the funding of such financing materially less likely to occur. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Parent will pay when due all fees due and payable under the Commitment Letters as and when they become payable. 

  

 5.19 _Takeover Statutes_. Parent, the Company and their respective boards of directors (or with respect to the Company, the Special Committee, if appropriate) shall (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the 

   ##### 

  

 

Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the Transactions. 

   

 5.20 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of shares of Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares of Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

MISCELLANEOUS  

  

 8.01 _Payment of Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear their own Expenses (as defined below) incurred by or on behalf of such party in preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation and financing of the Merger and the other Transactions. " _Expenses_ " as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of outside counsel, investment bankers, banks, other financial institutions, accountants, financial printers, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the investigation, due diligence examination, authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions and the financing thereof and all other matters contemplated by this Agreement and the Closing, together with any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any party in enforcing any of its rights set forth in this Agreement, whether pursuant to litigation or otherwise. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay H.I.G. Capital LLC (as agent for Parent and Merger Sub) the Break-Up Fee (as defined in _Section 8.01(c)_) if: 

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (A) _Section 7.02(b)_ and prior to such termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to any member of the Company Board or any officer of the Company, (B) _Section 7.02(c)_ and prior to the Stockholder Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known and in each case has not been withdrawn, or (C) _Section 7.03(a)_ and prior to the breach giving rise to such right of termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to any member of the Company Board or any officer of the Company, and 

  

 (ii) within nine (9) months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a transaction constituting an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this _Section 8.01_, all references (whether in words or numerals) to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "fifty percent (50%)". 

 

Payment of the Break-Up Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon the earlier of the
execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummation of any
transaction contemplated by, an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ or _7.03(d)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.04(b)_, then, on the date of any such termination of this Agreement by the Company under _Section 7.04(b)_ or within two (2) business days following termination of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub under  _Section 7.03(b)_ or _7.03(d)_ , the Company shall pay H.I.G. Capital LLC (as agent for Parent and Merger Sub) the 

   ##### 

  

   

Break-Up Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds. " _Break-Up Fee_
" means an amount equal to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,500,000). 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.02(c)_, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to Parents and Merger Subs Expenses, up to a maximum amount of Three Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,250,000) (it being agreed and understood that if the Break-Up Fee becomes payable pursuant to  _Section 8.01(b)_, any Expenses paid pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ shall be credited towards the payment of the Break-Up Fee), or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ in the case of a willful breach by the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to Parents and Merger Subs Expenses up to a maximum amount of Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) (it being agreed and understood that if the Break-Up Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_, any expenses paid pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ shall not be credited towards the payment of the Break-Up Fee), in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) business days following the receipt of invoices or other documentation of Parent and Merger Subs Expenses. 

   

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.04(c)_, (i) because Parent and Merger Sub fail to cause the Merger to be consummated because of a failure to receive the proceeds of one or more of the Debt Financings (other than as a result of Parents failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters due to a failure by Investor to fund its equity commitment pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) that, together with the amount of equity financing committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, are sufficient to fund the Transactions or because of their refusal to accept alternative debt financing, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub are not otherwise in material and willful breach of this Agreement (including their respective obligations pursuant to _Section 5.18)_ (a " _Non-Breach Financing Failure_ ") then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Break-Up Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days following such termination of this Agreement. " _Parent Break-Up Fee_ " means an amount equal to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000). 

   

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.03(e)_ or (ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 7.04(c)_ in circumstances not involving a Non-Breach Financing Failure, then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the " _Parent Default Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days following termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) The Company hereby acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.01_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay to Parent the full amount provided for in _Sections 8.01(b)_, _8.01(c)_ or _8.01(d)_ promptly following such payment becoming due, the Company shall (i) pay to Parent interest on such unpaid amount at the prime rate established by the Wall Street Journal Table of Money Rates on the date such payment was required to be made, during the period from and including the date payment of such amount was due up to but excluding the actual date of payment and (ii) reimburse Parent for any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by Parent in 

    ##### 

  

    

connection with Parents enforcement of its rights to such amounts under this
_Section 8.01_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event the Break-Up Fee becomes payable, then the Break-Up Fee shall be
Parent and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement
(except in the case of the events described in _Section 8.01(d)_ ). If Parent
or Merger Sub terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ in the
case of a willful breach by the Company, then Parent or Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy under this Agreement shall be to receive any Expenses of
Parent and Merger Sub payable pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ and any
subsequent Break-Up Fee payable pursuant to  _Section 8.01(b)_. The damages
resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a
Break-Up Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.01_
are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions. 

   

 (h) Parent hereby acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.01_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay to the Company the full amount provided for in _Sections 8.01(e)_ or _8.01(f)_ promptly following such payment becoming due, Parent shall (i) pay to the Company interest on such unpaid amount at the prime rate established by the Wall Street Journal Table of Money Rates on the date such payment was required to be made, during the period from and including the date payment of such amount was due up to but excluding the actual date of payment and (ii) reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Company in connection with the Companys enforcement of its rights to such amounts under this _Section 8.01_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Parent Break-Up Fee or Parent Default Fee is payable, then the Parent Break-Up Fee or Parent Default Fee, as applicable, shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement. If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.04(a)_ in the case of a willful breach by Parent or Merger Sub, then the Company may seek Company Damages (as defined in _Section 8.01(i)_) against Parent or Merger Sub; provided, that the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the Parent Break-Up Fee or Parent Default Fee) of Parent and Merger Sub, collectively, shall not exceed the Parent Liability Cap. The damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Parent Break-Up Fee or Parent Default Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.01_ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Group (including any amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 8.01(e)_ or  _8.01(f)_ ) for any direct or indirect loss or damage suffered in connection with, or arising out under, this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or claimed breach or failure or claimed failure to perform hereunder and including (notwithstanding Section 8.15) the benefit of the bargain lost 

   ##### 

  

   

by the Companys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including any lost premium, other combination opportunities and the time
value of money) (such damages, collectively, " _Company Damages_ ") or
otherwise shall be limited to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) plus any
amounts that may be payable under the second sentence of _Section 8.01(h)_
(the " _Parent Liability Cap_ "). In no event shall the Company or its
affiliates seek or permit to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages
or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any member of the Parent
Group other than, with respect to the Limited Guarantee, the Guarantor, in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company acknowledges
and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal
liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to Company Damages, any
member of the Parent Group (other than Parent and Merger Sub to the extent
provided in this Agreement and other than the Guarantor to the extent
provided in the Limited Guarantee), through Parent or otherwise, whether by
or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership
or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of
Parent against the Guarantor or any other member of the Parent Group, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except for
its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other member of
the Parent Group (including any general partner or managing member)) under
and to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee and subject to the Parent
Liability Cap and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against
the Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee or against Parent and Merger Sub to
the extent provided in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and its affiliates against the Guarantor and any other member
of the Parent Group in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising
under, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company
acknowledges that both Parent and Merger Sub are newly-formed companies and
do not have any material assets except in connection with this Agreement as
expressly set forth herein. The terms of this _Section 8.01(i)_ shall not be
deemed to be superseded, amended or modified in any respect by the terms of
any other provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section
8.01(i)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each member of the Parent Group. 

   

 (j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and subject to _Section 8.13_, the maximum aggregate liability of the Company and its affiliates (including any amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 8.01(b)_, _8.01(c)_ , or _8.01(d)_ ) for any direct or indirect loss or damage suffered in connection with, or arising out under, this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or claimed breach or failure or claimed failure to perform hereunder (such damages, collectively, " _Parent Damages_ ") or otherwise shall be limited to the Break-Up Fee and any Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub payable pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ plus any amounts that may be payable under the second sentence of _Section 8.01(g)_ (the " _Company Liability Cap_ ").

Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of 

   ##### 

  

   

recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with
respect to Parent Damages, any affiliate of the Company, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise. The terms of this _Section
8.01(j)_ shall not be deemed to be superseded, amended or modified in
any respect by the terms of any other provisions of this Agreement other than
_Section 8.13_. The provisions of this _Section 8.01(j)_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each affiliate of the
Company. 

   

 (k) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Break-Up Fee on more than one occasion nor shall Parent and Merger Sub be required to pay the Parent Break-Up Fee or the Parent Default Fee on more than one occasion and in no event pay  _both_ the Parent Break-Up Fee and Parent Default Fee, whether the Break-Up Fee, the Parent Break-Up Fee or the Parent Default Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same time or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. 

   

 8.02 _Guarantee_. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual performance of Merger Subs obligations hereunder and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporations obligations under _Sections 5.07_ and _5.15_. Parent will cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 8.03 _No Survival_. Subject to _Section 7.05_, the representations, warranties and agreements made in this Agreement shall not survive beyond the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreements set forth in _Articles 1_ and _2_ , _Sections 5.07_ and  _5.15_ and _Article 8_ shall survive the Effective Time. 

  

 8.04 _Non-Reliance_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company has not made and is not making any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for those representations and warranties set forth in  _Article 3_, and that they are not relying and have not relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided in _Article 3_. 

  

 8.05 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by Law requires the further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. Without limiting the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties. 

  

 8.06 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party 

   ##### 

  

 

(except that each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign its rights, interests
and obligations (a) to any of their respective affiliates or direct or
indirect subsidiaries (b) from and after the Effective Time, in connection
with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or
(c) from and after the Effective Time, to any lender providing financing to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, for
collateral security purposes, and any such lender may exercise all of the
rights and remedies of Parent hereunder; in each case without the consent of
the Company, so long as they remain primarily obligated with respect to any
such delegated obligation). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 8.07 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, unless the effects of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 8.08 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by overnight courier or telecopier to the respective parties as follows:
