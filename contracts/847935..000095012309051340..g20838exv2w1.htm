conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and thereby to receive the Merger Consideration
for each share of Common Stock subject to such exercised Options pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.01</U>.
As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any Option, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is not exercised pursuant to the preceding sentence and that has a per-share
exercise price less than the Merger Consideration (each, a &#147;<U>Cash-Pay Option</U>&#148;), shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the total number

Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Cash-Pay Option, with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the &#147;<U>Option Consideration</U>&#148;), payable to
the holder of such Cash-Pay Option, without dividends or interest, less applicable withholding
Taxes, in the manner provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.03(b)</U>. All such Cash-Pay Options, when so
converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a
Certificate representing a Cash-Pay Option shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Cash-Pay Options, except the right to receive the Option Consideration. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Company to, pay to holders of Cash-Pay Options the Option Consideration as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. Each Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that has a per-share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled, and each holder of a Certificate representing such canceled Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Option and shall not be entitled to
receive any payment with respect thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
&#147;<U>Option</U>&#148; means each outstanding unexercised option to purchase shares of Common Stock,

be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the Laws of the State of
Delaware, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such
holder&#146;s right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder&#146;s right to appraisal, the Dissenting
Shares held by such holder shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.01(a)</U>. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company. The Company shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
