subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement of Purchasers and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Michael V. Lewis and the MVL Trust dated August 3, 2010, in their

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those
conditions at such time; _provided_ that, if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (a) a
date during the Marketing Period specified by Purchaser on no fewer than three
(3) Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the second Business Day after
the end of the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or
waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ for the Closing as of the date the Closing is to occur
pursuant to this proviso). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Latham
and Watkins LLP at 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90071.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may take place at such other date,
time or place to which Purchaser and the Company may agree to in writing. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger,
executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). At or prior to the
Closing, the parties shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon
the due filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as Purchaser and the Company shall
agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to _Section 5.07_ ) and (b) the bylaws of the Company shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law
(subject to _Section 5.07_ ).

 



 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall continue in office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

SECTION 1.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Purchaser or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.0001, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Purchaser-Owned Stock; Treatment of
Stock Owned by Company Subsidiaries_. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company as treasury stock or that is owned by Purchaser
(including the Rollover Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled

 



      
 

 



 

and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Purchaser shall not
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at the
election of Purchaser, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled, in which case such shares shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled or converted into shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and any Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $11.00, without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock held in uncertificated book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)_ , without interest and subject to any withholding Taxes.

 



 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have
not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to
demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_ , and the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall promptly notify Purchaser of any
written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock and any attempted withdrawals of such demands or other
instruments received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser or as otherwise required by an Order, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Shares_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration required by _Section 2.01(c)_ and, in connection
therewith, shall, prior to the Closing Date, enter into an

 



      
 

 



 

agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required by _Section 2.01(c)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement
to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Purchaser in (i) short-term direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper
rated the highest quality by each of Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and
Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion. Any interest and other income from such investments may
be paid to Purchaser at its discretion. In the event the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(c)_ ,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional
funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in
the amount required to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall be required
to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock,
and to promptly make the payments to be made by the Paying Agent as provided
for in this _Article II_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
_Section 2.02(a)_ and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
registered holder of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which,
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent), and
which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as
Purchaser and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date,
including a customary release of claims by the holder against the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company, Purchaser and its Affiliates, including
claims arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent or such other
evidence of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, together with the associated letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with such letters instructions
(and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding
Taxes, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without
interest, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the

 



      
 

 



 

Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate so surrendered and shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to each
Book-Entry Share shall be made upon delivery by the holder of such Book-Entry
Share of a duly executed letter of transmittal in accordance with this
_Section 2.02(b)_ and such holder shall not be required to surrender any
Certificate. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(b)_ ,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as required by _Section 2.01(c)_ , subject to any withholding Taxes and
without interest.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates or
such Book-Entry Shares and, at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, it shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book Entry Shares held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without
interest thereon and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to five (5) years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority), any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock, Options, RSUs or PSUs in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards_. (a) At or prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take such actions as are necessary (including (x) obtaining
any resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans, and (y) taking
all actions necessary under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) to
effect the termination and payment as contemplated below of any RSUs and PSUs
that constitute "nonquliafied deferred compensation" within the meaning of
Code Section 409A), providing any necessary notices (subject to Purchasers
advance review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and obtaining any necessary consents, in each case,
if any, to provide that:

 



 

(i) subject to _Section 2.02(g)_ , and except as otherwise agreed by Purchaser
and the holder thereof, each unexercised option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (each, an " _Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, be canceled and terminated, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the excess, if any,
of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option _multiplied by_ (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that any Option which has an exercise price per share
that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment;

 



 

(ii) subject to _Section 2.02(g)_ , and except as otherwise agreed by
Purchaser and the holder thereof, each restricted stock unit award granted
under a Company Stock Plan that is payable in shares of Company Common Stock
or whose value is determined with reference to the value of shares of Company
Common Stock (each, an " _RSU_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be deemed to be fully
vested and non-forfeitable (to the extent not previously vested) and shall be
canceled and terminated, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Merger Consideration
_multiplied by_ (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 



 

(iii) subject to _Section 2.02(g)_ , and except as otherwise agreed by
Purchaser and the holder thereof, each performance-based stock award unit
granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _PSU_ ") whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the Effective Time, be deemed to be fully vested with respect to any
time-based vesting conditions and shall be (A) deemed to satisfy applicable
performance-based conditions immediately prior to the Effective Time to the
extent set forth in the award agreement and, as applicable, employment
agreement governing such award, (B) shall be forfeited to the extent that
applicable performance-based conditions are not so satisfied and (C) with
respect to the portion of any such award that is not forfeited in accordance
with the foregoing, shall be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest (unless otherwise
required pursuant to _Section 2.03(b)_ ), equal to (i) the Merger
Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the portion of the PSU satisfying the applicable performance-
based vesting in accordance with the foregoing provisions.

 



 

(b) _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. Promptly after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than the later of three (3) Business
Days after the Effective Time and the first full payroll cycle after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll
systems (i) the amounts due pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)(i)_ to the holders of
Options (the aggregate amount of such cash payable to the holders of Options,
the " _Option Consideration_ "), (ii) the amounts due pursuant to _Section
2.03(a)(ii)_ to the holders of RSUs (the aggregate amount of such cash payable
to the holders of RSUs, the " _RSU Consideration_ ") and (iii) the amounts due
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)(iii)_ to the holders of PSUs (the aggregate
amount of such cash payable to holders of PSUs, the " _PSU Consideration_ "
and, together with the Option Consideration and the RSU Consideration, the "
_Equity Award Consideration_ "). The Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver to any Person any shares of
Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company, Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation (or other consideration in respect thereof) pursuant
to (or in settlement of) any Options, RSUs or PSUs.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take all necessary actions with respect to the ESPP so
that: (i) at the ending date of the current offering period under the ESPP
(i.e., December 31, 2015) (the " _Final Purchase Date_ "), all outstanding
purchase rights (if any) shall be automatically exercised by applying the
payroll deductions of each then current participant to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; (ii)
as of the Final Purchase Date, the ESPP shall be suspended, and no offering
periods or purchase

 



      
 

 



 

periods shall thereafter commence under the ESPP and no payroll deductions or
other contributions shall thereafter be made or effected with respect to the
ESPP; and (iii) conditional upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, the
ESPP shall terminate effective on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
II_ to the contrary, if between the date hereof and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class or series by reason of the
occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section 2.04_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement.

understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the section
or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other section
or subsection of this Agreement solely to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such information is relevant to such other section or
subsection) or (b) disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC since January 1, 2014 and publicly available prior to

and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties and assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Purchaser, prior to the date of this Agreement, true and complete copies of
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "
_Company Certificate_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ").

or indirectly owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens, and free of any other limitation or restriction (including

capital stock or other equity or voting interests). All the shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each such Subsidiary have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and, in the case of

validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where
such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties and assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

and (iii) being referred to collectively as " _Company Subsidiary Securities_
") and (iv) no restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance
units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Purchaser and
Merger Sub to the Company concurrent with the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Purchaser Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any information
set forth in one section or subsection of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this
Agreement to which it corresponds and each other section or subsection of this
Agreement solely to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
information is relevant to such other section or subsection), Purchaser and
Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that:

 



 

SECTION 4.01. _Organization and Standing_. Purchaser is a limited liability
company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly

to carry on its business as presently conducted, except as would not, or would
not reasonably be expected to, impair or materially delay the ability of
Purchaser to (a) perform its obligations under this Agreement or (b)
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub has all requisite organizational power and authority
to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Each of Purchaser and
Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties and assets makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Purchaser has made
available to the Company, prior to the date of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of Purchasers and Merger Subs certificates of incorporation

"), as sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which adoption shall be provided by the
written consent of RT Rhombus immediately following the execution of this
Agreement), to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. No vote of holders of any securities of
Purchaser (equity or otherwise) is necessary under any Law to approve this
Agreement or the consummation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser and Merger Sub and the consummation by Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of Merger Sub and the sole
Member of Purchaser and, except for the adoption of the Merger by RT Rhombus
in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which adoption shall be
provided by the written consent of RT Rhombus immediately following the
execution of this Agreement), no other limited liability company or corporate
proceedings (as applicable) on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Purchaser and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,

do not, and the consummation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with Purchaser and

or other action of any Person under, contravene, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
cancelation or acceleration of any obligation under, or adversely modify any
right or obligation or cause the loss of any benefit to which the Purchaser or
Merger Sub is entitled under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties or assets of Purchaser or Merger Sub under, (i) the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable charter or
organizational documents of Purchaser or Merger Sub, (ii) any Contract to
which Purchaser or Merger Sub is a party or any of their respective
properties, assets or businesses is subject, (iii) any license, franchise,

Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser does not have any

satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing necessary to make the
Closing Date Payments will not be available to Purchaser on or prior to the
Closing Date.

related to the conditionality, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Financing) and the letter described on _Section
4.07(d)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter. The Commitment Letters are (i)
valid and binding obligations of Purchaser or RT Rhombus (as applicable) and
(in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Commitment Letter
and the Rollover Commitment Letter, to the Knowledge of Purchaser) of each of
the other parties thereto (subject to the effect of any Laws relating to
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
preferential transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in an Action in equity or at law)) and (ii) in full force and effect. As of
the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent, in each case, on the part of Purchaser, RT Rhombus or
Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters. Purchaser
has paid in full (or caused to be paid in full) any and all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters
that are due and payable on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or
altered, and none of the commitments under any of the Commitment Letters has
been withdrawn, terminated, amended, modified or rescinded in any respect. As
of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts
or arrangements (except for the Commitment Letters, the Engagement Letter, the
redacted fee letters referred to above and as set forth on _Section 4.07(d)_
of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter) to which Purchaser, RT Rhombus or Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates are party relating to the funding or investing,
as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing.

 



 

(e) Without limiting _Sections 6.02_ , _7.04_ and _8.08_ , in no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by or to Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any
of the obligations of Purchaser or Merger Sub hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 4.08. _Certain Arrangements_. Except for the Voting Agreement and the
Rollover Commitment Letter, as of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or
other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments
to enter into Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral
or written) (a) between Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any member of the Companys management

 



      
 

 



 

or Board of Directors, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company Common Stock or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or
approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 



 

SECTION 4.09. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 4.10. _Independent Investigation_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent investigation and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters, and is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
confirms that the Company has made available to Purchaser, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers and management of the Company, as well as access to
the documents, information and records of or with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to acquire additional information about the business and
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
Purchaser confirms that it has made an independent investigation, analysis and
evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 4.11. _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
the executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights, and to general equitable principles, including specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief), and is in
full force and effect, and as of the date hereof no fact, circumstance, state
of affairs or occurrence has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of the Guarantor under the terms and conditions of the Guaranty.

 



 

SECTION 4.12. _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, immediately after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the incurrence of the Debt Financing and the Preferred Financing, the Merger
and the payment of the Closing Date Payments, and assuming (a) the accuracy of
the Companys representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the
compliance by the Company with the covenants contained in this Agreement and
the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers and Merger Subs obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the waiver
of such conditions, and (b) the most recent financial forecasts of the Company
and its Subsidiaries delivered to

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were
and continue to be reasonable: (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
(determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will, as of such date,
exceed the total amount of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other
liabilities, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation
of the businesses in which they are engaged or in which they are proposed to
be engaged, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, will be able to pay their liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

a Takeover Proposal, or (C) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement, or fail to enforce any standstill or
confidentiality agreement unless the Board of Directors of the Company
determines after

 



      
 

 



 

consulting with the outside legal counsel that the failure to grant any such
waiver, amendment or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 5.02(a_) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the date
hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or
any of its Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal that was unsolicited
and did not otherwise result from a breach of the Companys obligations under
this _Section 5.02_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such
Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof or to request that any Takeover Proposal made
orally be made in writing and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that both (A) the failure to
take the applicable action referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below
would be inconsistent with the exercise of fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law
and (B) such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be expected to result, after
the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y)

(x) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or
group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal and, after entering into such

Person or group of Persons making a Takeover Proposal any written information
or other material information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
has not previously been furnished or made available to Purchaser or its
Representatives, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) furnish such information to Purchaser. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date
hereof that contains provisions that are substantially similar to and not less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
include a standstill.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Purchaser in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal or

and shall provide Purchaser with a copy of such Takeover Proposal (if in
writing) and all documents, instruments and communications relating thereto
or, if oral, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any
such Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Takeover Proposal and any arrangements with the Rollover Investors or
their Affiliates contemplated thereby, and the Company shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) of the status and terms of any such discussions or negotiations
and any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal
(including any amendments,

 



      
 

 



 

modifications or other changes thereto) and provide copies of all documents,
instruments and communications relating thereto. The Company agrees that it
and its Subsidiaries will not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any agreement with any Person that prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 5.02(c)_.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 5.02(e)_ and this _Section 5.02(d)_,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall:

recommend the approval or adoption of, or otherwise propose to recommend,
approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company

following a written request by Purchaser following the date any Takeover
Proposal or any material modification thereto is first published or sent,
given or communicated to the stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a
press release that reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation; provided, that
Purchaser may not make any such request on more than one occasion in respect
of any Takeover Proposal or any material modification of a Takeover Proposal,
(v) in the event of a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, fail to recommend against the acceptance of
such offer by the Companys stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of the
commencement thereof, (vi) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.02(b)_
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (vii) resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing (any action described in the foregoing
clauses (i)-(vi) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may (A) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in circumstances involving a Takeover Proposal
if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that both (x) such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, and (B) solely with respect to a
Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this _Section 5.02_, cause the Company to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ and concurrently pay to Purchaser
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.04(a)_; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
thereof, as applicable, shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take
any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) unless (1) the
Company has given Purchaser at least four (4) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include a copy
of such Superior Proposal (if in writing) or a summary of the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (if made orally) that serves as the
basis for such action and the identity of the Person or

 



      
 

 



 

group of Persons making such Superior Proposal), (2) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Purchaser during such notice period, to the extent Purchaser wishes to
negotiate, to enable Purchaser to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal and (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof has
considered in good faith such proposed revisions, and has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the Superior Proposal nevertheless continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed were to be given effect. Any
modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Superior
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.02(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the period during which the Company and its Representatives are required
to afford Purchaser an opportunity to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement, and to negotiate with Purchaser in response to such new Takeover
Proposal, shall expire on the later to occur of (x) two (2) Business Days
after the Company provides written notice of such new Takeover Proposal to
Purchaser and (y) the end of the original four (4) Business Day period
described in the preceding sentence.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in circumstances not involving a Takeover
Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined (after taking into account revisions proposed by Purchaser pursuant
to clause (ii) of the following proviso) in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change due to events occurring after the date
hereof that materially affect the business, assets or operations of the
Company and that are not known or reasonably foreseeable on the date hereof
would result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
effecting any such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall (i)
provide Purchaser with written information describing in reasonable detail any
event that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 5.02(e)_ as promptly as practicable after
the occurrence of such event (and in any event at least four (4) Business Days
before such Adverse Recommendation Change) and shall keep Purchaser informed,
on a current and ongoing basis, of material developments relating thereto, and
(ii) negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with
Purchaser during such notice period, to the extent Purchaser wishes to
negotiate, to enable Purchaser to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would no longer result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication under Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule

connection with such communication publicly reaffirms the Company Board

Recommendation Change has occurred (unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.01_). Unless the Board has made an Adverse
Recommendation Change as specifically permitted by _Sections 5.02(d)_ or
_5.02(e)_ , the Board of Directors of the Company shall continue to recommend

Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company may adjourn, recess or postpone the Company

after consultation with Purchaser, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement (that the Board of the

consent, and neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub shall, without the Companys
prior written consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any waiting

Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required to take any Regulatory
Action unless it is expressly conditioned on

 



      
 

 



 

the effectiveness of the Merger and (y) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall agree without Purchasers prior written consent, to take
any action, or accept any conditions, restrictions, obligations or

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or

other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding

parties hereto and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
Person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iv) to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or
such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other
parties hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.06_ of
this Agreement, each party shall furnish the other party with copies of all

substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Authority with respect
to this Agreement and the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and furnish the other party with such necessary information

the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Purchaser and Purchasers
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Purchaser may reasonably request. Purchaser and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company. The
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so could violate
applicable Law, waive the protection of an attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other legal privilege, in each case that cannot be cured
by entry into a joint defense agreement or similar arrangement. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access
or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Purchaser that it is withholding such access or information
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or risk waiver of such privilege (including by entering into a
joint defense agreement or similar arrangement). All requests for information
made pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ shall be directed to the General Counsel
of the Company or other Person designated by the Company. For the avoidance of
doubt, until the Effective Time, all information provided by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ or pursuant
to _Section 5.02_ will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and this _Section 5.06_ of this Agreement, which shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Purchaser acknowledges
that the information being provided to it in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that actions taken by the parties
hereunder, to the extent necessary to comply with their respective obligations
under _Section 5.04_ hereunder, shall not be deemed to be in violation of
this _Section 5.06_ or the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _further_
, that the foregoing shall not affect _Section 5.04(d)_ to the extent that
_Section 5.04(d)_ specifies that it is subject to this _Section 5.06_ or the
Confidentiality Agreement. All non-public information provided by or on
behalf of Purchaser, Guarantor or the Preferred Investors or their respective
Affiliates to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions

 



       
 

 



 

contemplated hereby (including the Financing) shall be kept confidential
except for such disclosures as are required by applicable Law or legal
process.

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) For a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or, while serving as a director or officer of the
Company, is or was a director or officer of a Subsidiary of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or
officer of the Company or, while serving as a director or officer of the
Company, is or was a director or officer of a Subsidiary of the Company or (B)
acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director
or officer of the Company or, while serving as a director of officer of the
Company, a director or officer of a Subsidiary of the Company (including in
connection with the Indemnitees serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B), at any time prior to the Effective Time (including any
Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, for
a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless
otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation (and the equivalent organizational or constitutional
documents of each of its Subsidiaries) to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
indemnification of directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
than are set forth as of the date hereof in the Company Certificate and the
Company Bylaws (or such Subsidiaries equivalent organizational or
constitutional documents), which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall advance any expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section
5.07_ (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations referred to in this _Section 5.07_) in connection with any Action
to which such Indemnitee is or is threatened to be made a party by reason of
the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or,
while serving as a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving as a
director or officer of a Subsidiary of the Company, as incurred to the fullest
extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are advanced shall first
provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that
such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section
5.07(a)_.

 



 

(b) None of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment on behalf of any Indemnitee in any
threatened or actual

 



      
 

 



 

Action relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 5.07_
(each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought or may be
sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of
any threatened or actual Action relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 5.07_ and shall provide access to properties and
individuals during normal business hours and in a manner that shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested and furnish or cause
to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (or substitute policies with
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with
respect to matters arising on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that,
if the aggregate annual premium for such insurance exceeds 300% of the current
annual premium for such insurance, then Purchaser shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the most advantageous
coverage as is then available at a cost up to but not exceeding 300% of such
current aggregate annual premium. At the Companys option, the Company may (or
if requested by Purchaser, the Company shall) purchase, using a broker
mutually selected by the Company and Purchaser acting in good faith and taking
into account available policy price and coverage options, prior to the
Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that in
no event shall the Company spend or commit to spend for such "tail" policies
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the current aggregate annual
premium of the Companys current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. If such prepaid "tail"
policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this _Section
5.07(c)_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, by
Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 5.07_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the

 



      
 

 



 

rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.07_ applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee has consented in writing to such termination or modification (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.07_
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.07_).

 



 

(e) In the event that Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.07_.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall,
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.0_7 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or the
Rollover Commitment Letter by each Person or group (for purposes of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters_. (a) Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) to provide, to each individual who is employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues
in employment with Purchaser or one if its Affiliates following the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with: (i) during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, a base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than
the base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the 180th day following the Closing,
coverage under the severance policy set forth on _Section 5.09(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (without adverse modification), such that if any
such Company Employees employment is terminated under circumstances that
would give rise to severance entitlements under such policy, such Company
Employee shall receive such severance entitlements thereunder.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.09(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Purchaser cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor
in accordance with their terms all of the Companys employment, severance,
retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time and set forth
on

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 5.09(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and, in each case, as may
be amended from time to time after the Effective Date in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA), providing employee benefits to the Company Employees
after the Effective Date (collectively, the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits
(including benefit accrual rates) and vesting, each Company Employees service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.09(a)_, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) to use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any Purchaser Plan
providing medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits, except
to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar eligible expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the Effective Time
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under each
Purchaser Plan providing medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable
Company Plans prior to the Effective Time).

 



 

(e) With respect to any Company Employees based outside of the United States,
Purchasers obligations under this _Section 5.09_ shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

 



 

(f) If the Effective Time occurs on or prior to June 1, 2016, the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall, as of the Effective
Time, determine the level of achievement of relevant performance metrics
through the Effective Time with respect to the Companys annual cash bonus
plan for the fiscal year of the Company in which this Agreement is executed
(the " _Company Annual Bonuses_ "); provided, that (i) such determinations
shall measure actual performance reasonably and in good faith in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practices, to the extent reasonably
practicable, (ii) in no event shall the aggregate Company Annual Bonuses so
determined exceed the aggregate annual cash bonuses for the fiscal year
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, and (iii) the Company shall
not and shall have no obligation to pay (or cause to be paid) the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Annual Bonuses earlier than the time that annual cash bonuses have been paid
to Company employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to pay, the Company Annual Bonuses to the Company Employees at
the time that annual cash bonuses have been paid to Company Employees in the
ordinary course of the Companys business and consistent with the Companys
past practice.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
provisions of this _Section 5.09_ are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, (ii) no provision of this _Section 5.09_ is intended to,
shall be deemed to, or shall (A) constitute the establishment or adoption of,
or an amendment to, any Company Plan, Purchaser Plan or employee benefit plan

right of Purchaser and its Affiliates to terminate reassign, promote or demote
any employee or other service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary at any
time following the Effective Time, or (C) obligate Purchaser to adopt or
maintain any particular plan or program or other compensatory or benefits
arrangement at any time or prevent Purchaser from modifying or terminating any
such plan, program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time;
and (iii) no current or former employee or other service provider of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or any of their dependents or beneficiaries)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

SECTION 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_. Prior
to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company, and
the Company shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, of (i) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser and (ii)
any Actions commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such
party or the directors of the Company which relates to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any securityholder derivative
claims). The Company shall give Purchaser the opportunity to participate in
the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company

hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Purchasers prior
written consent.

897(c) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 5.13. _Financing_. (a) Purchaser shall use (and shall cause RT
Rhombus to use) its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letters, subject to the third sentence of this _Section 5.13(a)_, (ii)
negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Debt Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter) or on such other terms and
conditions acceptable to Purchaser subject to Purchasers compliance with
clauses (1)-(4) of this _Section 5.13(a)_, (iii) negotiating definitive
agreements with respect to the Preferred Financing consistent with the terms
and conditions contained in the Preferred Commitment Letter or on such other
terms and conditions acceptable to Purchaser subject to Purchasers compliance
with clauses (1)-(4) of this _Section 5.13(a)_ (the " _Definitive Preferred
Agreements_ " and, together with the Definitive Debt Agreements, the "
_Definitive Financing Agreements_ "), and (iv) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements
applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates to obtain the Financing that are
within Purchasers or such Affiliates control. If all conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.01_ and _6.02_ and contained in the Commitment Letters (other
than, (A) with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Sponsor
Equity Financing, the Preferred Financing and the Rollover Investment and (B)
with respect to the Preferred Financing, the availability of the Debt
Financing, the Rollover Investment and the Sponsor Equity Financing) have been
satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), Purchaser shall use (and shall
cause RT Rhombus to use) its reasonable best efforts to draw the full amount
of the Financing on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not (and shall cause RT
Rhombus not to), without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any
amendment, supplement or modification to, termination of, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, or replace, the Commitment Letters if such
amendment, supplement, modification, termination, waiver or replacement (1)
would (x) add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions to Purchasers
or RT Rhombuss receipt of the Financing in a manner that would materially
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Purchaser to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) be reasonably expected to materially delay the funding
of the Financing or otherwise make the funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur, (2) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that,
when combined with the cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
available on the Closing Date to make the Closing Date Payments, is
insufficient to pay the Closing Date Payments, (3) adversely affects the
ability of Purchaser or RT Rhombus to enforce its rights against any of the
other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements
as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against any of such other parties
to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (4) would
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the
ability of Purchaser to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date; _provided_ that RT Rhombus
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of

 



      
 

 



 

the date of this Agreement if doing so would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impede or delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date. Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
5.13(a)_, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing" shall refer
to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or
replaced and the debt financing contemplated thereby. Upon any such amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the Preferred Commitment
Letter in accordance with this _Section 5.13(a)_, the terms "Preferred
Commitment Letter" and "Preferred Financing" shall refer to the Preferred
Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced
and the financing contemplated thereby. Purchaser shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to obtain the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser and RT Rhombus may agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or
other modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, or any termination, rescission or withdrawal of, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Preferred Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement
and may obtain equity or debt financing in substitution of all or a portion of
the Debt Financing or the Preferred Financing so long as any such action does
not violate this _Section 5.13_.

 



 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing that is necessary to pay the Closing
Date Payments becomes unavailable, Purchaser will (i) use (and cause RT
Rhombus to use) its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later
than the date on which the Closing is to occur pursuant to _Section 1.02_),
alternative financing (as applicable, in an amount sufficient to replace such
unavailable Debt Financing) from the same or other sources and on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to Purchaser and RT Rhombus than such
unavailable Debt Financing and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to seek (A) the
Sponsor Equity Financing from any source other than the Guarantor, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Sponsor Commitment Letter, (B)
the Preferred Financing from any source other than the Preferred Investors, or
in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Preferred Commitment
Letter or (C) the Rollover Investment from any Person other than the Rollover
Investors.

 



 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter,"
"Sponsor Commitment Letter," "Preferred Commitment Letter" and "Rollover
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance with this _Section 5.13_ (and any Debt Commitment Letter, Sponsor
Commitment Letter, Preferred Commitment Letter or Rollover Commitment Letter,
as applicable, remaining in effect at the time in question). Purchaser shall
provide the Company with prompt written notice of (i) any threatened in
writing or actual material breach or default by any party to any Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of which Purchaser acquires
Knowledge, or (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Rollover Investor or any Financing Source with respect
to any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation of any
provision thereto by

 



      
 

 



 

any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements;
_provided_ , that in no event will Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be under
any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to any applicable
legal privileges (including attorney-client privilege) in a manner that would
destroy the privilege.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including (i) making
senior management and Representatives of the Company reasonably available to
participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies and any other similar
sessions or presentations upon reasonable advance notice, (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, solely with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, effective no earlier than the
Closing, (iii) assisting the Purchaser in the preparation of the Marketing
Materials and the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the
Definitive Financing Agreements; (iv) taking such actions as are reasonably
requested by Purchaser or its Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction
on a timely basis of all conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing;
(v) taking all actions as may be required or reasonably requested by Purchaser
or its Financing Sources in connection with the repayment of the Existing
Company Debt (including providing customary payoff letters and releases of all
related Liens) upon the Closing; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to cause
its independent auditors to cooperate with the Debt Financing and to provide
the Specified Auditor Assistance; (vii) taking such actions as may be required
to permit any cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
be made available on the Closing Date to finance, in part, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (viii) using its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Debt Financing benefits from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ix) delivering to
Purchaser the Required Information, (x) providing a certificate of the chief
financial officer or other senior financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters as of the Closing on a pro forma basis in the form
provided in Annex I to Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter (as of the date
hereof), (xi) using reasonable best efforts to deliver to Purchaser the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and related
statements of income, equity and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have been
reviewed by the Companys independent accountant in accordance with AU 722,
Interim Financial Information, and a managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations, in each case, in a form that
could be filed with the SEC on a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in a form
sufficient to receive from the Companys independent accountants customary
"comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) with respect to such
financial statements and financial information (such financial statements and
information the " _December 31 Information_"), by February 1, 2016 and (xii)
furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources promptly, and in any event no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, that has been reasonably requested by
the Purchaser or the Financing Sources at least eight (8) days prior to the
Closing Date. The Company will provide to Purchaser and its Financing Sources
such information as may reasonably be necessary

 



      
 

 



 

so that the Required Information and Marketing Material are and remain
Compliant. The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that
such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) The foregoing notwithstanding, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required by this _Section 5.13_ to enter into any
certificate or agreement that is effective before the Effective Time, (ii)
nothing in this _Section 5._13 shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would, in connection with any debt financing other than the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Notes (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter)), impose on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its and their officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, agents and other Representatives, any meaningfully greater
burden, obligation, time commitment or other commitment than those that would
have been imposed on them in the context of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof, (iii) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any Persons who are
directors or officers of the Company shall be required to pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing prior to
the Closing, and (iv) no obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall be required to (A)
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense
that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing, or (B) take any action that would conflict
with or violate the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries organizational
documents or any Laws. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.13_ or otherwise
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to be an
issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing. Purchaser shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with such cooperation on the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_. Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action
taken by them at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates), except in
the event such losses arose out of or result from the bad faith, gross
negligence, material breach or willful misconduct of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

 



 

(f) If the Company at any time in good faith believes that it has delivered
the Required Information in accordance with _Section 5.13(d)_, it may (but is
under no obligation to) deliver to Purchaser a written notice to such effect,
in which case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required
Information as of such date unless Purchaser in good faith reasonably believes
the Company has not completed the delivery of the Required Information and
delivers to the Company within five (5) Business Days a written notice
describing in

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable detail what information that constitutes Required Information has
not yet been delivered. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates obtained by
Purchaser or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.01_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision hereof

_Section 7.04_, _Article VIII_, the Guaranty and the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and
there shall be no liability on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the

Company from any liability for any willful and material breach of this
Agreement by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement, and (c)
that no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for fraud.

 



 

SECTION 7.03. _Company Termination Fee; Expense Payment_.

 



 

(a) In the event that:

 



 

(i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_;

 



 

(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to

pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(i)_, (y) any Person shall have made or announced
a Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such
termination and (z) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, a Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months
after termination of this Agreement,

 



 

then, the Company shall, (1) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) above,
within three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, (2) in the
case of clause (ii) above, prior to or concurrent with, and as a condition to
the effectiveness of such termination, or (3) in the case of clause (iv)
above, concurrently with the date of such entry or consummation, pay to

Following receipt by Purchaser (or one or more of its designees) of the
Company Termination Fee (together with any amounts owed pursuant to _Section
7.03(c)_) in accordance with this _Section 7.03_, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions

wire transfer of immediately available funds out-of-pocket fees and expenses

Million Dollars ($6,000,000) (the " _Expense Payment_ "), which amount shall
be credited against any Company Termination Fee payable to Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 7.03(a)_.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay, in a timely manner, any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 7.03_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse
Purchaser for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable
fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including
in connection with any related Actions commenced, and (ii) the Company shall
pay to Purchaser interest on such amount from and including the date payment
of such amount was due, but excluding the date of actual payment, at

 



      
 

 



 

the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

 



 

SECTION 7.04. _Purchaser Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that this
Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(i)_

cash (the " _Purchaser Termination Fee_ ") to be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after such
termination (it being understood that in no event shall Purchaser be required
to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

 



 

(b) Subject to the rights of the Company pursuant to _Section 8.08_, the
Companys right to receive (x) the Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 7.04(a)_, (y) any amounts owed pursuant to _Section 7.04(d)_, and
(z) any amounts owed pursuant to the final two sentences of _Section 5.13(e)_
(the amounts described in the preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z) being
referred to herein collectively as the " _Recoverable Amounts_ "), in each
case from Purchaser in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, or from the Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company
against (i) Purchaser, Merger Sub, or the Guarantor, (ii) any Rollover
Investor, Preferred Investor, Lender or other Financing Source, including each
party to the Commitment Letters, and their respective Affiliates,
Representatives, successors and assigns, and (iii) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees or successors of any Person named in clause (i), and
any future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees or successors of any of the foregoing (the Persons
described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the " _Purchaser
Group_ ") for any liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or damages
suffered as a result of, in connection with, or otherwise related to any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or
otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that neither this _Section
7.04(b)_ nor _Section 7.04(c)_ below shall limit the obligations of Rizvi
Traverse Management, LLC pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement or any of the Companys rights thereunder.

 



 

(c) Upon payment of the Recoverable Amounts (if and when due and payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), no Person shall have any rights or
claims against the Purchaser Group under this Agreement, the Commitment
Letters, the Guaranty or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in
tort or otherwise, and the Purchaser Group shall not have any further
liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing), and the
Company agrees to cause any action or proceeding pending in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the Company against the Purchaser or any other member of

 



      
 

 



 

the Purchaser Group to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days thereafter. In no event shall the Company seek or
permit to be sought any losses or damages from, or otherwise bring any action
or proceeding against, the Purchaser Group in connection with this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than an
action or proceeding to recover payment of the Recoverable Amounts from
Purchaser or the Guarantor or for specific performance as set forth in
_Section 8.08_, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Group shall not
have any liability for monetary damages of any kind or nature or arising in
any circumstance in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than the payment of the Recoverable
Amounts (if and when due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement).
Nothing in this _Section 7.04(c)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or
construed to expand the circumstances in which Purchaser or any other member
of the Purchaser Group may be liable under this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing). For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section 8.08_ and the payment of the
Recoverable Amounts, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in a
Closing and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Purchaser
Termination Fee (together with any amounts owed pursuant to _Section
7.04(d)_).

 



 

(d) Each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.04_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to pay, in a timely manner, any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 7.04_, then (i) Purchaser shall reimburse the
Company for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable
fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including
in connection with any related Actions commenced, and (ii) Purchaser shall pay
to the Company interest on such amount from and including the date payment of
such amount was due, but excluding the date of actual payment, at the prime
rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

SECTION 8.01. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement_. Subject to clause (iv) of _Section
8.06(a)_, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be
amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by action taken by the respective
Boards of Directors (or equivalent governing bodies) of each of the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which
by

 



      
 

 



 

Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such approval. Any amendment or supplement to this Agreement shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

conditions (it being understood that Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be deemed

hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding two (2) sentences, this

by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 8.04_ shall be

declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court
within the State of Delaware). In addition, each of the parties hereto (i)
consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not

 



      
 

 



 

attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any
objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of

Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or services performed or to be performed by a
Financing Source thereunder, including any Debt Financing or Preferred
Financing, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts sitting in the County of New York, State of New York. The
Company, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties, (i) submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (iii) agrees that a
final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law, (iv) agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any Company Related

hereby or thereby or services performed or to be performed by a Financing
Source thereunder

 



 

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement_. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it

 



       
 

 



 

will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.

hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Purchaser to cause the full funding of (x) the Sponsor
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor
Commitment Letter and (y) the Rollover Investment pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Rollover Commitment Letter and to cause Purchaser to effect
the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.02_ of this Agreement, in each
case, only if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions in
_Sections 6.01_ and _6.02_ of this Agreement (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived, (ii)
the Debt Financing (or alternative financing in accordance with _Section
5.13_ of this Agreement), the Preferred Financing (or alternative financing in
accordance with _Section 5.13_ of this Agreement) and the Rollover Investment
have been funded or will be funded on the date of the Closing in accordance
with the terms thereof, (iii) Purchaser fails to complete the Closing by the
date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_ of
this Agreement and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that
if specific performance is granted and the Sponsor Equity Financing, the
Preferred Financing, the Rollover Investment and the Debt Financing are
funded, then it would take such actions as are required of it or are otherwise
in its control to cause the Closing to occur.

 



 

SECTION 8.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE

MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
