Assigned Contracts and Assigned Permits and Applicable Law, and no action
hereunder shall constitute an assignment thereof, except to such extent and
_provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent consent of any Person or
Governmental Authority to the assignment, or notice to any Person or
Governmental Authority of the assignment, is required pursuant to the terms of
such Assigned Contract or Assigned Permit or Applicable Law, no assignment or
attempted assignment will be deemed to have been effected by the provisions of
this Agreement without such consent or notice. To the extent that an Assigned
Contract or Assigned Permit or Applicable Law permits such an assignment,
and notice to or consent of any Person or Governmental Authority is required,
Seller shall deliver to the applicable Person or Governmental Authority the
required notice in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Contract or Permit, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which
shall not require any payment of money or other consideration) to obtain any
required consents prior to the Closing Date. To the extent that a Contract or
Permit or Applicable Law does not permit Seller to assign any Contract or
Permit that would otherwise constitute a Purchased Asset, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide to Buyer, at the request of
Buyer, the benefits of any such Contract or Permit (to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law), (ii) enforce and perform, at the request and expense of
Buyer, for the account of Buyer, any rights or obligations of Seller arising
from any such Contract or Permit (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law)
against or in respect of any Third Party, including the right to elect to
terminate any Contract or Permit (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law)
in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Buyer, or otherwise
enter into with Buyer such other arrangements sufficient to provide
equivalent benefits and burdens to Buyer and (iii) at the request of Buyer,
assist in the procurement of a transfer to or assumption by the Buyer of any
Permit (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) or the issuance of a
comparable Permit to the Buyer; _provided_ that Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection with
entering into any such arrangement.



(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to work together (and, if necessary and
desirable, to work with the third parties to the Shared Contracts) in an
effort to (i) divide, modify or replicate (in whole or in part) the respective
rights and obligations under and in respect of the Shared Contracts and (ii)
if possible,



 

6 novate the respective rights and obligations under and in respect of the
Shared Contracts, such that, effective as of the Closing, (A) the Buyer is
the beneficiary of the post-Closing rights and is responsible for the post-
Closing obligations related to that portion of the Shared Contract included in
the Assigned Contracts (the " _OSB Portion_ ") (so that, subsequent to the
Closing, the Seller shall have no post-Closing rights or post-Closing
obligations with respect to the OSB Portion of the Shared Contract) and (B)
the Seller is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the
obligations related to each Shared Contract other than the OSB Portion (the "
_Non-OSB Portion_ ") (so that, subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer shall have
no rights or obligations with respect to each Non-OSB Portion of the Shared
Contract). If the parties are not able to enter into an arrangement to
formally divide, modify or replicate one or more of the Shared Contracts prior
to the Closing as contemplated by the previous sentence, then (i) the Buyer
shall be entitled to the benefits of the OSB Portion of any such Shared
Contract accruing after the Closing Date to the extent that the Seller may
provide such benefits (A) in a manner not in violation of the terms of such
Shared Contract and (B) _provided_ that Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection with
entering into any such arrangement and (ii) if the Seller provides such
benefits to the Buyer, the Buyer shall perform at its sole expense the
obligations of the Seller to be performed after the Closing under the OSB
Portion of such Shared Contract.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
not assume, and Seller shall be responsible for the payment, satisfaction,
performance and discharge of, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
from and against, all liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, expenses,
damages or responsibilities of Seller, whether known or unknown, absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due other than
the Assumed Liabilities, including, but not limited to, the following
(collectively, the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "):



     | (i) | any liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating
to the Business or any Purchased Asset to the extent arising during or
relating to the period prior to the Closing, including, but without
limitation, all Pre-existing Environmental Liabilities;

     | (ii) | any liability, obligation or commitment, whether express or
implied, liquidated, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, or known or

primarily to, or that arises primarily out of, any Excluded Asset, or that

7 any liability, obligation or commitment for Taxes, whether or not accrued,

     | (vi) | except as expressly provided in Section 5.07, any
liability, obligation or commitment arising under any Benefit Plan;

liability, obligation or commitment relating to or arising out of infringement

relating to or arising out of the operation of the Business or products
manufactured at any Facility or shipped or sold by or on behalf of the
Business on or prior to the Closing; 
---|---|--- 


     | (viii) | except as expressly provided in Section 5.07, (A) any
liability, obligation or commitment relating to or arising out of, the
employment of any Employee or Former Employee of Seller prior to the Closing
and (B) any liability, obligation or commitment that relates to, or arises out
of, the termination of the employment by Seller of any Employee or Former
Employee of Seller; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ix) | the industrial development revenue bonds and the pollution
control revenue bonds listed on Schedule 1.02(d)(ix);

Seller; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (xi) | any liabilities, obligations and commitments in respect of
costs and expenses incurred by Seller or the Business in respect of or
relating to this Agreement, including compliance by Seller with the terms
hereof. 
---|---|--- 



Section 1.03  _Payment of Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller payment, by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date), of immediately available funds in an amount equal
to the Base Purchase Price plus an amount equal to an estimate prepared by
Seller (and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) and delivered to Buyer at least
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date of any adjustments to the Base
Purchase Price under Section 1.06 (the Base Purchase Price plus such estimate
of any adjustments under Section 1.06 being herein referred to as the "
_Closing Payment_ ").



Section 1.04 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As soon as practicable after the
date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other and agree upon the
allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 1.04 shall survive the
Closing Date indefinitely. Seller and Buyer agree that the values



 

8 attributed to the Purchased Assets shall be arrived at in compliance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall (i) timely file all forms required to be filed in
connection with such allocation, (ii) be bound by such allocation for purposes
of determining Taxes, (iii) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to
prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such allocation,
and (iv) not take any position on any return, declaration, report or
information return or statement inconsistent with the allocation set forth in
Schedule 1.04, unless otherwise required by any Applicable Law. Buyer shall
prepare and deliver IRS Form 8594 to Seller within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date to be filed with the IRS. Any post-Closing adjustment to the
Purchase Price shall be reflected in the final allocation of the Purchase
Price among the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Each party hereto will
promptly notify the other if it receives notice that a Governmental Authority
proposes any allocation that is different from the allocation agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller.



Section 1.05 _Further Assurances_. At the Closing and from time to time after
the Closing, (a) at the request of Buyer and without further consideration,
Seller shall promptly execute and deliver to Buyer such certificates and other
instruments of sale, conveyance, assignment and transfer, and take such other

sell, convey, assign and transfer to and vest in Buyer or to put Buyer in
possession of the Purchased Assets, and (b) at the request of Seller and
without further consideration, Buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to
Seller such certificates and other instruments of assumption, and take such
other action, as may reasonably be requested by Seller more effectively to
confirm and carry out the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

(a) Preparation of Preliminary Closing Statement.



     | (i) | As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date but
in any event within sixty (60) days thereafter, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth, as of the first instance in time
(Central Time) on the Closing Date, the Current Assets of the Business and the
Current Liabilities of the Business and the amount of working capital
(calculated as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities) (the " _Net Working
Capital_ ") (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "). The Preliminary Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP and an example of
the calculation of Net Working Capital is set forth in Schedule 1.06(a)(i). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Buyer will make available to Seller and its
representatives, as requested by Seller, all Assigned Records deemed
reasonably necessary or desirable by Seller in preparing the Preliminary
Closing Statement. 
---|---|--- 



(b) _Review of Preliminary Statements_. Buyer and its independent certified
public accountants may review the Preliminary Closing Statement and the
Records and books of



 

9 account of Seller relating to the Business and may make inquiry of the
appropriate employees of Seller and of Sellers accountants. The Preliminary
Closing Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted
by, Buyer unless Buyer shall have notified Seller in writing within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement of any
objections thereto (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). A Dispute Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the items of the Preliminary Closing Statement that are
being disputed and shall set forth a reasonably detailed summary of the
reasons for such dispute. The parties agree that any amounts to be paid
pursuant to this Section 1.06 which were not disputed in the Dispute Notice
shall be paid to the applicable party within ten (10) days after the Sellers
receipt of the Dispute Notice.



(c) _Disputes_. At the request of Buyer or Seller, any dispute between the
parties relating to the Preliminary Closing Statement which cannot be resolved
by them within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Dispute Notice
shall be referred to the Disputes Auditor for decision, and the decision of
the Disputes Auditor shall be final and binding on both parties. The parties
agree that they will require the Disputes Auditor to render its decision
within thirty (30) days after referral of the dispute to the Disputes Auditor
for decision pursuant hereto. Before referring a matter to the Disputes
Auditor, the parties shall agree on procedures to be followed by the Disputes
Auditor (including procedures for presentation of evidence). If the parties
are unable to agree upon procedures before the end of thirty (30) days after
Sellers receipt of the Dispute Notice, the Disputes Auditor shall establish
procedures giving due regard to the intention of the parties to resolve
disputes as quickly, efficiently and inexpensively as possible; the Disputes
Auditors procedures may be, but need not be, those proposed by either Buyer
or Seller; _provided, however_ , that the Disputes Auditor shall in all cases
use U.S. GAAP in resolving any dispute. The parties shall, as promptly as
practicable, submit evidence in accordance with the procedures agreed upon or
established by the Disputes Auditor, and the Disputes Auditor shall decide the
dispute in accordance therewith as promptly as practicable. The fees and
expenses of the Disputes Auditor for, and relating to, the making of any such
decision shall be borne by the parties equally.



(d) _Final Closing Statement_. The Preliminary Closing Statement shall become
final and binding on both parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Dispute
Notice has been given, the expiration of the period within which Buyer may
notify Seller of any objections to the Preliminary Closing Statement pursuant
to Section 1.06(b), (ii) agreement by Seller and Buyer that such Preliminary
Closing Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed to in
writing by Seller and Buyer, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on
which the Disputes Auditor issues its decision with respect to any dispute
relating to such Preliminary Closing Statement. The Preliminary Closing
Statement, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or
pursuant to the decision of the Disputes Auditor, when final and binding on
both parties, is herein referred to as the " _Final Closing Statement_."



(e) _Calculation and Payment of Adjusted Purchase Price_. The Base Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the Net Working
Capital plus Potlatch Liabilities shown on the Final Closing Statement exceeds
the Benchmark Working Capital and the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased
by the amount, if any, by which the Benchmark Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital plus Potlatch Liabilities shown on the Final Closing Statement
(the Base Purchase Price as so increased or decreased shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). If the Closing Payment is
more than the Adjusted



 

10 Purchase Price Seller shall, and if the Adjusted Purchase Price is more than
the Closing Payment Buyer shall, within ten (10) days after the Final Closing
Statement has been established pursuant to Section 1.06(d), make payment in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by the party to which such payment is to be made, of the amount of
such difference, plus interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal under the column titled
"Money Rate" on the Business Day preceding the date of such payment, accruing
from the date that is ten (10) days after delivery to Buyer of the Preliminary
Closing Statement to the date of payment of such amount.



Section 1.07 _Proration of Taxes_. Buyer and Seller agree that Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Assets and the Business (but in no event
including income Taxes) shall be prorated as of the Closing, with Seller
liable to the extent such items relate to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing, and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to periods
commencing after the Closing (including, in each case, Taxes attributable to
the portion of any Straddle Period ending or commencing on such date, as
appropriate). In connection with these prorations, in the event that actual
figures are not available at the Closing Date, the proration shall be based
upon the actual Taxes or other amounts accrued through the Closing or paid for
the most recent year (or other appropriate period) for which actual Taxes or
other amounts paid are available. Such prorated Taxes or other amounts
shall be re-prorated and paid to the appropriate party within sixty(60) days
of the date that the previously unavailable actual figures become available.
Buyer and Seller agree to furnish each other with such documents and other
records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all adjustment and
proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 1.07. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no proration shall be made under this Section
1.07 with respect to (x) accrued property taxes shown on the Final Closing
Statement and (y) Transfer Taxes described in Section 5.05.

thereby, other than (i) those set forth on Schedule 4.03, (ii) those that may
be required by reason of the terms or nature of the Purchased Assets or the
participation of Seller (as opposed to those required solely by reason of the
participation by Buyer as opposed to any other Third Party, including any
other Third Party organized outside, or controlled by a Person organized
outside, the United States) in the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements and (iii) those that, if not obtained or made by Buyer,
such failure would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



Section 4.04 _Financial Ability to Perform_. Sufficient funds and credit
arrangements are available to Buyer as of the date hereof, and will be
so available to Buyer at the Closing, to enable Buyer to pay the Purchase
Price and all other amounts payable by it hereunder at the Closing and to pay
any and all amounts which may be payable pursuant to Section 1.03 and Section
1.06 at the time therein provided.

_COVENANTS_



Section 5.01 _Seller s Obligations Prior to Closing_. Without in any way
limiting any other obligations of Seller under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing:



(a) Seller (x) shall conduct the Business only in the ordinary and normal
course and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
Business and the Purchased Assets and the goodwill of suppliers, customers
and others having business relations with the Business consistent with past
practice and (y) shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, enter
into any transaction or refrain from doing any action that, if effected
before the date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any
representation and warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement (provided
that the failure of Seller to comply with this clause (y) shall in no event
cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.01(b)). Without
limiting the foregoing Seller will not, without the prior written consent of
Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):



     | (i) | increase any compensation payable to any Employees or make
any other change in the terms of employment of any of the Employees not
consistent with past practices;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | except for cause, dismiss or transfer any key senior
management Employee and Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any such
dismissal or transfer;

other than ordinary course purchases from suppliers and sales to customers of
the Business;

     | (vi) | amend or agree to amend any of the Assigned Permits; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | assign, transfer, license, or abandon any Assigned
Intellectual Property or Assigned Technology other than in the ordinary course
of business. 
---|---|--- 


(b) Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at
or before the time of the Closing, at its expense, all of the consents to
assign the Assigned Contracts and Assigned Permits provided that Seller shall
not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to any Person to obtain any
such consents; 



(c) Seller shall pay and discharge its liabilities relating to the Business
and the Purchased Assets as they come due in the ordinary course in accordance
and consistent with its previous practice, except those contested in good
faith by Seller;



(d) until the earlier of the completion of the Closing or any termination of
this Agreement, Seller will deal exclusively with Buyer with respect to the
sale of the Business and the Purchased Assets, and Seller and its directors,
officers, employees, representatives and agents shall not, directly or
indirectly, solicit, encourage, or initiate any offer or proposal from, or
engage in any discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement,
commitment or understanding or otherwise act jointly or in concert with, or
provide any information to, any Person or entity, other than Buyer and its
affiliates, employees, representatives and agents, concerning any transaction
involving the Business or the Purchased Assets;



(e) Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain by the time
of the Closing, at its expense, discharges of all Encumbrances against
the Purchased Assets that are not Permitted Encumbrances; and

reasonable efforts to consult in good faith on a regular and frequent basis
with the representatives of Buyer to report material operational developments
and the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures
reasonably requested by Buyer or such representatives that do not unduly
interfere with Sellers operation of the Business.



Section 5.02 _Access to Information, Due Diligence_. Seller shall afford to
Buyer and its accountants, counsel, environmental consultants and other
representatives of any of the foregoing (such entities and representatives
other than Buyer being referred to as " _Buyer s Representatives_")
reasonable and timely access in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operations of the Business, during the period prior to the
Closing, to all the



 

39 employees, managers, properties, books, contracts, commitments, information
systems, Tax returns and Records of the Business, and, during such period
shall furnish promptly to Buyer and Buyers Representatives any information
(including, with respect to environmental matters, all relevant records,
audits, assessments, field notes, monitoring well data and other documents or
information in possession of Seller) concerning the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities as Buyer (or any Buyers Representative) may
reasonably request. Seller will permit Buyer and Buyers Representatives to
conduct such studies as Buyer may reasonably request to establish the current
environmental status of the Business, the Purchased Assets and to assess
Assumed Liabilities arising from or related to Environmental Laws so long
as such surveys and studies do not materially interfere in the operation of
the Business.



Section 5.03 _Confidentiality_.



(a) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of a letter
agreement dated June 4, 2004, between Buyer and Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall be permitted to use and disclose
such information to the extent necessary to make any filing or obtain any
consent or approval required in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
(other than the provisions contained therein with respect to the solicitation
of Sellers employees) shall terminate.



(b) (x) Seller shall keep confidential, and use reasonable efforts to cause
its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees
and advisors to keep confidential, (i) all information that is known by
Seller to be confidential information regarding Buyer, any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their businesses being provided to it in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements and (ii)
after the Closing all information relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and (y) Buyer shall keep confidential, and
use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep confidential all
information that is contained in any Record constituting a Purchased Asset
that is known by Buyer to be confidential information relating to any
business of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Business and not
relating to the Business, except (in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y)
above) (A) as required by law or administrative process (to the extent so
required) (in which case the party required to disclose confidential
information shall promptly notify the other party and give the other party an
opportunity to oppose such disclosure) or by any securities exchange or
applicable securities laws, (B) as necessary to defend or prosecute any
litigation or dispute, (C) as permitted by the license granted in Section
5.12(b) below, (D) for information that is publicly available on the Closing
Date, or thereafter becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section 5.03(b), (E) with respect to the obligations of
Seller, (I) with respect to any Excluded Liability or Excluded Assets or (II)
as reasonably necessary in connection with any claim of Seller hereunder
against Buyer or any claim of Buyer hereunder against Seller or Sellers
pursuit of remedies against any Third Party with respect to any such claim or
(F) with respect to the obligation of Buyer, as reasonably necessary in
connection with any claim of Buyer hereunder against Seller or any claim of
Seller hereunder against Buyer or Buyers pursuit of remedies against any
Third Party with respect to any such claim. The covenant set forth in this
Section 5.03(b) shall terminate three years after the Closing Date. 



 

40 (c) Each party providing any information in connection with this Agreement is
not waiving, and will not be deemed to have waived or diminished, any of its
attorney work product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar
protections and privileges as a result of disclosing such information
(including information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the
other party, regardless of whether such disclosing party has asserted, or is
or may be entitled to assert, such privileges and protections. The parties (a)
share a common legal and commercial interest in all of such information that
is subject to such privileges and protections; (b) may become joint defendants
in Legal Proceedings to which such information covered by such protections and
privileges relates; (c) intend that such privileges and protections remain
intact should any party become subject to any actual or threatened Legal
Proceeding to which such information covered by such protections and
privileges relates; and (d) intend that after the Closing the receiving party
shall have the right to assert such protections and privileges. No receiving
party shall admit, claim or contend, in Legal Proceedings involving either
party or otherwise, that any party disclosing such information waived any of
its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar
protections and privileges with respect to any information, documents or other
material disclosed to a party due to a disclosing party disclosing information
(including information related to pending or threatened litigation) to such
receiving party.



_Section 5.04 Reasonable Best Efforts_. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions or do or cause to be
done all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill the conditions to
Closing hereunder and to cause the Closing to occur as soon as practicable,
including taking all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with respect
to the Closing and to cause all other conditions to be satisfied. Each of the
parties hereto will furnish to the other party hereto such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions
to any governmental agency. Buyer and Seller each agree (i) to file any
Notification and Report Forms and related material that may be required to be
filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice (the " _Department of Justice_ ") under the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting periods, and (iii) to
make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or
advisable. For purposes of this Section 5.04, the "reasonable best efforts" of
Buyer shall include (1) opposing any motion or action for a temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunction against or other prohibition of the
Closing and (2) entering into a consent decree, or other order or other
agreement, or giving an assurance, commitment or undertaking, containing
Buyers agreement to hold separate and divest (pursuant to any terms as may
be required by an Governmental Authority) the business, products and assets of
any product or service lines of the Business or any other business, product
line, service lines division or subsidiary of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
and otherwise to take such other action as may be required by any Governmental
Authority, provided, however, that neither the foregoing nor anything else in
this Agreement shall require Buyer to take any action or agree to take or not
to take any action if the taking of any such action or the agreement to take
or not to take any such action would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the



 

41 benefits (viewed as a whole) reasonably expected to be derived by Buyer from
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any action that would (x)
involve a change in or restriction on the business, products, assets or
operations of the Business, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer or (y) involve the
disposition (whether by way of sale, lease, license or otherwise), before or
after the Closing, of all or any portion of the business, products or assets
of the Business, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.



Section 5.05 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Whether or not the Closing takes
place, and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense. The following items shall be shared and
paid by Buyer as to 50% and by Seller as to 50%.



(a) All Transfer Taxes applicable to, or incurred in connection with or
attributable to, the conveyance and transfer from Seller to Buyer of the
Purchased Assets, including any filing or recording fees applicable to such
conveyance and transfer (including deeds and assignments covering any or all
of the Facilities). Each party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of
any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes or fees, and to
cooperate with the other party in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.



(b) The costs of preparing the surveys covering any or all of the Facilities,
and Buyer shall select and supervise the surveyor.



(c) The cost of title insurance searches, reports, commitments, policies and
related documents covering any or all of the Facilities.



(d) The closing fee charged by the title insurance company.



(e) The filing fees with respect to the filing under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.06  _Brokers or Finders_. Each of Buyer and Seller represent, as to
itself and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or other
firm or Person is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any
other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a result of any actions by such party,
except (i) as to Buyer and its Affiliates, Deutsche Bank Securities, whose
fees and expenses will be paid by Buyer and (ii) as to Seller and its
Affiliates, Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees and expenses will be paid by
Seller.



Section 5.07 _Employee Matters_.



(a) With respect to the group of Active Employees who are not covered by the
Extension (whether or not any such Active Employee is covered by the
Labor Agreement) on the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment providing
substantially comparable wages and benefits, in the aggregate, as provided by
Seller on the Closing Date (not including retiree health and life insurance
benefits, supplemental retirement benefits and equity-based incentive
compensation plans). Active Employees who accept such offers of employment are
referred to



 

42 herein as the " _Continuing Employees_ ". With respect to any Active Employees
who are covered by the Extension (if applicable), Buyer shall offer
employment consistent with the terms of the Extension. " _Active Employees_ "
means each Business Employee who is actively at work as of the Closing Date.
In addition, each other Business Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on
vacation, holiday or jury duty or on an approved leave of absence (including
military leave, bereavement leave, disability leave and workers compensation
leave), and who within the time frame specified in the Extension, if
applicable, or, if not, within the shorter of the period ending one year
following the Closing Date or the period ending seven days following such
vacation, holiday, jury duty or approved leave of absence, presents himself
or herself to Buyer as ready, willing and able (to Buyers reasonable
satisfaction) to commence the same active employment with Buyer, shall be
deemed to be an Active Employee as of the time of such commencement. For the
avoidance of doubt, "Active Employees" excludes each employee of or with
respect to the Business whose employment rights have terminated under the
Labor Agreement prior to or as of the Closing Date.



(b) Up to the Closing Date Seller shall retain (i) sole sponsorship of,
and exclusive responsibility for all liabilities and obligations under,
arising out of, or relating to, each Benefit Plan, and (ii) sole
responsibility for all liabilities and obligations under, arising out of, or
relating to, the employment or termination of employment of each Active
Employee (including all liabilities and obligations arising from effects
bargaining with any union). Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any payments for
severance or separation pay made by Seller to any Active Employee who within
18 months after the Closing Date is terminated by Buyer (other than for the
type of conduct defined as "cause" or "misconduct" in either Sellers
Severance Program for Executive Employees, as amended and restated as of
December 1, 1999, or Sellers Salaried Severance Benefits Plan, as amended
through June 17, 2004, whichever is applicable (together, the " _Severance
Programs_ ")) or who voluntarily terminates employment with Buyer for any of
the reasons specified in Schedule 5.07(b) and becomes entitled to receive
benefits under any separation agreement listed on Schedule 5.07(b)
(collectively, the " _Separation Agreements_ "); provided, however, that the
amount of such reimbursement shall be limited to the amount paid by Seller to
which the employee would have become entitled under the express provisions of
Section 3(a) of the respective Severance Program (without the application of
any provision in the Severance Programs giving Seller or a committee the
discretion to enhance the stated severance benefits), if Buyer were a
"Participating Company" as defined in the Severance Programs. Seller shall
cause each Continuing Employee to fully vest in respect of any benefits
accrued under the Seller 401(k) Plans and any Seller Pension Plans effective
immediately prior to the Closing Date.



(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) maintained by Buyer, to the extent such plan is made available to a
Continuing Employee, solely for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting, service with Seller shall be treated as service with
Buyer with respect to such Continuing Employee. With respect to Buyer Pension
Plans, service with Seller which was used in determining the Continuing
Employees accrued benefits under Seller Pension Plans shall be treated as
service with Buyer for purposes of determining the Continuing Employees
accrued benefits under Buyer Pension Plans, as described in Section 5.07(f).
A Continuing Employees service with Seller shall be treated as service with
Buyer for purposes of Buyers severance, vacation and other paid-time-off
policies that apply to such Continuing Employee.



 

43 (d) Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement to be entered into by Buyer
and Seller as of the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to cover the
Continuing Employees under Sellers welfare benefit plans through December 31,
2004 or such earlier date as Buyer shall elect (with reasonable notice to
Seller), and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for its actual costs for providing
such coverage. Buyer shall cover the Continuing Employees under its own
welfare benefit plans beginning January 1, 2005 or such earlier date as Buyer
shall elect (with reasonable notice to Seller). Buyer shall waive, or cause
to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitation under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Buyer in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate, to the extent that such pre-
existing condition was waived in Sellers comparable plan. In addition, with
respect to Continuing Employees, any obligation arising under the Consolidated
Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) on or after the Closing Date and on or
prior to December 31, 2004, or such earlier date as Buyer shall elect (with
reasonable notice to Seller) is deemed the obligation of the Seller, but the
actual costs to Seller of fulfilling such obligation shall be reimbursed to
Seller by the Buyer. 



(e) Within a reasonable time following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
designate or establish one or more defined contribution plans to receive, at a
Continuing Employees option in accordance with Applicable Law, a transfer of
any vested account balances of the Continuing Employees maintained under
Seller 401(k) Plans. As soon as reasonably possible after the requirements
set forth in the preceding sentence are satisfied, and after Buyer is
reasonably satisfied (consistent with the regulations promulgated under
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) that the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan meets
the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, Seller
shall cause the portion of the Seller 401(k) Plans representing the vested
account balances of the Continuing Employees who elected such transfer to be
transferred or spun off to the plan(s) designated or established by Buyer
pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph. Seller and Buyer shall take
all steps necessary or required to carry out the plan-to-plan
transfer contemplated by this paragraph, including but not limited to,
providing any advance notice to participants and beneficiaries of the Seller
401(k) Plans and filing any advance notices required by any federal laws,
including the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
Buyer shall take any and all steps necessary to maintain the qualified status
of any plan(s) designated or maintained pursuant to this paragraph.



(f) As of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall cease to accrue
benefits under the Potlatch Corporation Salaried Employees Retirement Plan
or the Potlatch Corporation Hourly Employees Retirement Plan, as applicable
(each a " _Seller Pension Plan_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Pension
Plans_ "), and shall be treated as having terminated employment with Seller
and its Affiliates as of such date for all purposes under such plans. Within a
reasonable time after the Closing Date and effective as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall establish a pension plan or plans which are substantially
comparable to the Seller Pension Plans (" _Buyer Pension Plans_ "). In
accordance with Section 5.07(c), with respect to Continuing Employees who were
on the Closing Date participants under a Seller Pension Plan, the Buyer
Pension Plans will recognize service with Seller as service with Buyer for
purposes of determining eligibility and vesting and accrued benefits. The
retirement benefits accrued and payable under the Buyer Pension Plans shall be
offset by retirement benefits scheduled to be paid under the Seller Pension
Plans in effect at the time of Closing. This offset shall be performed with
respect to each Continuing Employee who becomes a participant under any Buyer
Pension Plan by subtracting B from A, where B is such Continuing Employees
accrued benefit under the



 

44 Seller Pension Plan at the time of Closing converted (using the actuarial
factors set forth in Seller Pension Plans at the time of Closing) to a single
life annuity payable at age 65, and A is such Continuing Employees accrued
benefit under the applicable Buyer Pension Plan payable as a single life
annuity payable at age 65. As soon as reasonably practicable after the time
of Closing, Seller shall certify to Buyer the accrued retirement benefit of
each such Continuing Employee expressed as a single life annuity payable at
age 65 and the periods of service considered for eligibility, vesting and
accrued benefit purposes under the applicable Seller Pension Plan at the time
of Closing. Continuing Employees shall be entitled to receive their vested
accrued benefits under the applicable Seller Pension Plan at the time and in
the manner prescribed in the plan document for such plan. Seller shall retain
all liability and responsibility for the payment of benefits under the Seller
Pension Plans. To the extent any Continuing Employee is entitled to receive a
lump sum distribution of his or her accrued benefit under a Seller Pension
Plan, Buyer agrees to cause a Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct rollover"
contribution of such lump sum distribution (in the form of cash) if such
rollover is elected in accordance with Applicable Law by such Continuing
Employee, provided that Seller is reasonably satisfied (consistent with the
regulations promulgated under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) that the
applicable Buyer 401(k) Plan meets the requirements for qualification
under Section 401(a) of the Code and Buyer is reasonably satisfied
(consistent with the regulations promulgated under Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) that the applicable Seller Pension Plan meets the requirements for
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code.



(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.07(b), with respect to each
Continuing Employee who, as of the Closing Date, was a salaried employee of
the Seller prior to July 1, 1988 and who has satisfied the eligibility
requirements (including as to age and service) to receive retiree
health insurance benefits from Seller under a Benefit Plan or otherwise (a "
_Retiree Medical Eligible Employee_ "), Seller shall retain the sole liability
and obligation to provide retiree health insurance benefits to each such
Continuing Employee under the terms of the applicable retiree health
insurance program, as made available to employees of Seller generally from
time to time. With respect to each Continuing Employee, who, as of the Closing
Date, was a salaried employee of the Seller, and who has satisfied the
eligibility requirements (including age and service) to receive retiree life
insurance benefits from Seller under a Benefit Plan or otherwise (a " _Retiree
Life Eligible Employee_ "), Seller shall retain the sole liability and
obligation to provide retiree life insurance benefits to each such Continuing
Employee under the terms of the applicable retiree life insurance program as
made available to employees of Seller generally from time to time. With
respect to Continuing Employees (other than Retiree Medical and Life Eligible
Employees), Buyer shall provide retiree health and life insurance benefits to
such employees to the extent such employees satisfy the eligibility
requirements to receive such benefits under Buyers retiree health and life
insurance program (if any), as made available to Buyers United States
employees generally from time to time.



(h) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an extension of
the Labor Agreement with PACE for a duration satisfactory to Buyer, to take
effect on and following the Closing, on substantially the same terms as the
Labor Agreement, which terms shall be subject to the approval of the Buyer
(the " _Extension_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Extension must
provide for (a) the replacement of the 401(k) plan described in Article
19.01(G) of the Labor Agreement with a 401(k) plan of the Buyer (with employer
contributions to be made in cash rather than stock of Seller) and the
replacement of the pension plan described in



 

45 Article 19.03(F) and Appendix #B of the Labor Agreement with a pension plan of
the Buyer; and (b) the replacement of the medical insurance plan, sickness
and accident benefit plan, life and ADandD insurance plan, dental plan, life
insurance plan for spouses and weekly sickness and accident indemnity plan
described in Articles 19.01 (A)-(F) and 19.03 (A)-(E) of the Labor Agreement
with similar plans of Buyer that provide substantially comparable benefits in
the aggregate on a going-forward basis to employees covered by the Labor
Agreement; (ii) that Seller shall keep Buyer informed as to the status of,
and will consult with Buyer as to the strategy for, all such negotiations
pursuant to this Section 5.07(h); and (iii) that Seller shall act consistently
with this Section 5.07(h) and any obligation under Applicable Law, and, unless
prohibited by law, shall not enter into the Extension without the prior
approval of Buyer. Provided that Seller is able to enter into the Extension
prior to the Closing, under all of the terms and conditions outlined in this
Section 5.07(h), Buyer shall also enter into the Extension and shall assume
the Labor Agreement with the Extension upon the Closing.



(i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to prevent the termination by Buyer of employment of any
Continuing Employee or any change by Buyer in the employee benefits available
to any Continuing Employee.



Section 5.08  _Post-Closing Cooperation_.



(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause their
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate with
each other after the Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the Business
from Seller to Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the Business and the
other businesses of Seller and Buyer that might result from the transactions
contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Buyer and
Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access (including the ability
to make copies), during normal business hours, to such information and
assistance relating to the Business (to the extent within the control of such
party or any of its Affiliates) as is contained in any Record, or is
reasonably necessary for (i) financial reporting, Tax and accounting matters
and (ii) defense or prosecution of litigation and disputes.



(b) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer and Seller
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance (to the extent within the control
of such party) relating to the Purchased Assets (including, access to books
and records) as is reasonably necessary for compliance with accounting and
reporting requirements, filing of all Tax returns, and making of any election
related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding related to any
Tax return. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Business or the
Purchased Assets. In the event that Seller or Buyer shall after the Closing
take any position in any Tax return, or reach any settlement or agreement
relating to Taxes on audit, which is in any manner inconsistent with any
position taken by Seller in any Tax filing, settlement or agreement made by
Seller prior to the Closing and such inconsistent position (i) might require
the payment by Buyer or Seller of more Tax than would have been required to be
paid had such position not been taken or such settlement or agreement not been
reached,



 

46 (ii) affects the determination of useful life, basis or method of
depreciation, amortization or accounting of any of the Purchased Assets or
any of the properties, assets or rights of Buyer or (iii) might accelerate the
time at which any Tax must be paid by Buyer or Seller, then Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, shall provide timely and reasonable notice to the other
party hereto of such position.



(c) Each of Buyer and Seller will retain all Records and other documents
pertaining to the Business in existence on the Closing Date for a period of
seven years following the Closing. No such Records or other documents shall be
destroyed or disposed of by any retaining party at any time without first
advising the other party in writing and giving such party a reasonable
opportunity to obtain possession thereof for the purposes permitted by this
Section 5.08(c).



(d) Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section
5.08. Neither party shall be required by this Section 5.08(d) to take any
action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Buyer, the
Business). Any information relating to the Business received by Seller
pursuant to this Section 5.08 shall be subject to Section 5.03.



(e) Buyer shall file any Tax Returns (excluding income Tax Returns) required
to be filed with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Business that are
due after the Closing Date for any Straddle Period. Buyer shall deliver to
Seller (i) copies of any such Tax Returns due after the Closing Date for any
Straddle Period and (ii) a statement setting forth Sellers pro rata portion
of the Tax due with respect to such Tax Returns as determined pursuant to
Section 1.07, for comment and approval not later than sixty (60) days before
such Tax Returns are due. If, within twenty (20) days after the receipt of
such Tax Returns, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller disagrees with
the Tax Return or statement, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith
to resolve their disagreement within twenty (20) days following Sellers
notification to Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve their disagreement within fifteen (15) days following any such
notification by Seller, the dispute shall be submitted to the Disputes Auditor
for resolution within twenty (20) days of such submission. The cost of such
independent accounting firm to resolve any such dispute shall be borne equally
by Seller and Buyer. Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount reflected on the
statement at least three (3) days prior to the due date of such payment
except where the amount is subject to dispute as provided above.



(f) Not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer (i) copies of any Tax Returns filed with respect to the
Purchased Assets and the Business that were due on or before the Closing Date
for any Straddle Period and (ii) a statement setting forth Buyers pro rata
portion of the Tax due with respect to such Tax Returns as determined pursuant
to Section 1.07. If, within twenty (20) days after the receipt of such
Tax Returns, Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer disagrees with a Tax
Return or statement, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve their disagreement within twenty (20) days following Buyers
notification to Seller of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to resolve their disagreement within fifteen (15) days following any such
notification by Buyer, the dispute shall be submitted to the Dispute Auditor
for resolution within twenty (20) days of such 



 

47 submission. The cost of such independent accounting firm to resolve any such
dispute shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall pay to Seller
the amount reflected on the statement at least three (3) days prior to the due
date of such payment except where the amount is subject to dispute as provided
above.



Section 5.09 _Publicity_. No public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required
by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities
exchange, in __which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. In addition, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall make any general communication to suppliers, lenders,
creditors, distributors, employees, customers or others having business or
financial relationships with the Business pertaining to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of
the other party. __



Section 5.10 _Assigned Records_. Buyer recognizes that certain Assigned
Records may contain incidental information relating primarily to
subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Business and that Seller
may retain copies of the relevant portions thereof. Seller agrees that it
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, provide Buyer at Closing with copies
of any portions of Records that are Excluded Assets relating to the Business
and, if any such Records are discovered after Closing, promptly upon such
discovery.



Section 5.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller
with the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" or "bulk sales law"
of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Potlatch Name is and shall remain
the property of Seller or its Affiliates and that nothing in this
Agreement shall transfer or shall operate as an agreement to transfer any
right, title or interest in the Potlatch Name to Buyer. Subject to Section
5.12(b) below, Seller is not granting Buyer a license to use the Potlatch Name
after the Closing.

 



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
months) after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cease to use any written
materials that are publicly distributed as of the Closing Date, including
without limitation, labels, packing materials, letterhead, advertising
materials and forms, which include the word "Potlatch"; provided, however,
that Buyer may, without modification, use inventory, product literature and
sales literature (but not including any product warranty, letterhead, business
cards, invoices or the like) in existence as of the Closing Date until the
earlier of the exhaustion of such materials or the date that is six months
from the Closing Date.



(c) Immediately following the Closing, Seller shall cease all use of the
names, trade names and trademarks set forth on Schedule 5.12(c) or any name
that is confusingly similar to or includes any such names, and none of Seller
or any of its Affiliates shall thereafter use those names, or combinations or
variations thereof, or names confusingly similar thereto.



 

48 Section 5.13 _Insurance_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain its current insurance coverage under each insurance policy
maintained by Seller with respect to the Business (including business
interruption insurance or insurance otherwise covering loss of profits) or
covering any Purchased Asset until the Closing Date. Buyer acknowledges that
after the Closing Date Seller shall have no responsibility for obtaining or
maintaining any insurance relating to the Business, whether relating to or
arising out of occurrences prior to, at or subsequent to the Closing. 



Section 5.14 _Title and Survey_. Seller agrees that it will provide all
assistance to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the
issuance to Buyer of the title insurance policies described in Section 6.01(e)
(such assistance to include the furnishing of affidavits to remove
the standard title exceptions) and the surveys in connection therewith,
provided that any out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in connection with
such assistance are reimbursed by Buyer.



Section 5.15 _Compliance with Plant Closing Laws_.



(a) Seller shall be responsible for complying with the WARN Act with respect
to any employee employed in connection with the Business, other than a
Continuing Employee, who suffers an "employment loss" (as that term is defined
under the WARN Act) or a separation from employment or a reduction in hours of
employment that with the passage of time reasonably can be expected to
constitute an "employment loss" (hereinafter, " _Affected Employees_ ") prior
to and through the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with periodic
reports (not less than bi-weekly) between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, listing all individuals who, within 90 days preceding such report,
became Affected Employees and shall describe with respect to each such
Affected Employee the date on which such individual became an Affected
Employee, the individuals date of hire and regularly scheduled hours over
the preceding six months, the Affected Employees last job title, department
and job assignment, and the reason for such employment loss.



(b) Buyer shall be responsible for complying with the WARN Act with
respect to the Continuing Employees following the Closing Date.



(c) During the past three years Seller has not effectuated or experienced
with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Business: (i) a "plant closing" or
a "business closing" (as defined in the WARN Act or any other Applicable
Law) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating
units within any site of employment or facility of Seller; (ii) a "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or any other Applicable Law) affecting any
site of employment or facility of Seller, nor has Seller been affected by any
transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any other Applicable Law that would affect
Buyer after the Closing or (iii) any similar action under the WARN Act
requiring notice to employees in the event of an employment loss or layoff.



 

49 Section 5.16 _Governmental Communications_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall:



(a) promptly notify the other party of any written communication to it
from any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to Applicable Law, if
practicable, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Authority in response thereto and
incorporate the other partys reasonable comments provided within two Business
Days of that review;



(b) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
such Government Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by that Government Authority, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend; and 



(c) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filing and
written communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.



Section 5.17 _Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges that (a) all of the insurance
policies maintained by the Seller prior to the Closing Date will be terminated
with respect to the Business effective as of the Closing Date and (b) upon
such termination, the Business will cease to be covered under such policies
and Buyer will have to obtain replacement coverage (including coverage as the
Buyer deems appropriate for the Purchased Assets, the operation of the
Business and the satisfaction of the Assumed Liabilities). To the extent the
Seller receives any proceeds from claims against insurance policies covering
the Purchased Assets (the " _Insurance Claims Proceeds_ ") following the
Closing, Seller shall promptly remit such Insurance Claim Proceeds to Buyer.



Section 5.18 _Surveys_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
Buyer may obtain such surveys of the Real Property (the " _Buyer s Surveys_")
and, upon reasonable prior notice, Seller shall afford to Buyer, and all
surveyors acting on Buyers behalf such access during normal business hours
to the Facilities relating to the Real Property as is reasonably required and
does not unreasonably disrupt normal business operations to permit such
surveyors to conduct surveys and prepare the Buyers Surveys for purposes of
obtaining title insurance as Buyer shall reasonably request. Buyer shall
promptly provide Seller with a copy of the Buyers Surveys. Buyer shall
maintain or cause each of its agents to maintain insurance reasonably
acceptable to Seller (and shall deliver evidence of same to Seller) prior to
entering onto the Facilities in connection with such surveys.



Section 5.19 _IRB Financings_.



(a) Seller shall, at the sole cost of Seller, cause all Encumbrances on the
Purchased Assets arising from the IRBs to be terminated on or prior to
the Closing.



(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall not be subject to, or
responsible for complying with, or have any liability in respect of, any
restrictions, limitations, covenants or obligations imposed on Seller in
connection with any IRBs or with respect to the operation or use of any
Purchased Asset related thereto.



 

50 Section 5.20 _Minnesota Power Agreement_. So long as Buyer is purchasing
electric power for the Grand Rapids Facility under the Amended and Restated
Electric Service Agreement between Seller and Minnesota Power, dated May 30,
2003 (the " _Minnesota Power Agreement_ "), for any month in which payment is
required with respect to the "Brainerd Demand Obligation" under Section 5 of
the Minnesota Power Agreement, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such payments
made by Buyer. If for any month in which Seller is not entitled to be billed
under the Large Power Service Schedule under Section 6 of the Minnesota Power
Agreement, Seller will reimburse Buyer for the difference between the cost
actually incurred for the purchase of electric power under the Large Light and
Power Service Schedule (as discounted in the manner provided in the Minnesota
Power Agreement) and the amount which Buyer would have paid under the Large
Power Service Schedule (the " _Excess Rate Payment_ "); provided, however,
that the amount payable for the Excess Rate Payment shall in no event exceed
$10,000 in any month. Buyer shall submit invoices to Seller for any
reimbursement requested under this Section 5.20, with such evidence of payment
by Buyer, invoices from Minnesota Power and such other
supporting documentation as is reasonably requested by Seller.

ARTICLE VII 



_INDEMNIFICATION_



Section 7.01 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article VII, Seller agrees to indemnify and save harmless Buyer from and
against all Losses suffered or incurred by Buyer as a result of or arising
directly or indirectly out of or in connection with:



(a) any breach by Seller of or any inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement;



 

53 (b) any breach or non-performance by Seller of any covenant to be performed by
Seller that is contained in this Agreement;



(c) the Excluded Liabilities; and 



(d) noncompliance by the Seller with the provisions of any so-called "bulk
transfer law" or "bulk sales law."



Section 7.02 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article VII, Buyer agrees to indemnify and save harmless Seller from and
against all Losses suffered or incurred by Seller as a result of or
arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with:



(a) any breach by Buyer of or any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement;



(b) any breach or non-performance by Buyer of any covenant to be performed by
Buyer that is contained in this Agreement;



(c) any failure by Buyer to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Labor Agreement after the Closing;



(d) the Assumed Liabilities; and 



(e) the operation of the Business subsequent to the Closing. 



Section 7.03 _Notice of Claim._ If a party becomes aware of any Claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice of the Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. The notice shall specify whether the Claim is a Third-Party Claim or
whether the Claim is a Direct Claim, and shall also specify with reasonable
particularity (to the extent that the information is available) the factual
basis for the Claim and the amount of the Claim, if known.



Section 7.04 _Direct Claims_. With respect to any Claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement that is not a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_
"), following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim in
accordance with Section 7.03, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days
to make any investigation of the Claim as the Indemnifying Party considers
necessary or desirable. For the purpose of that investigation, the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied
upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all
other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both
parties agree at or before the expiration of that thirty day period (or any
mutually agreed upon extension of that thirty day period) to the validity and
amount of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the
Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the Claim during such period.
If the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to the validity and
amount of the Claim, then the Indemnified Party may pursue any remedies
available to it subject to the terms of this Agreement.



 

54 Section 7.05 _Third-Party Claims_. With respect to any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense, to assume control of
the negotiation, settlement or defense of the Claim and, in the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any fees of any other
counsel or other expenses in connection with the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the negotiation,
settlement or defense of the Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to monitor and participate in the negotiation, settlement or defense of
that Third-Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, and the
fees and disbursements of that counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume control of the
negotiation, settlement or defense of the Claim, fails to defend the Third-
Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to assume control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of the Claim. If
any Third-Party Claim is of a nature that the Indemnified Party is required by
Applicable Law to make a payment to any Third Party with respect to the Third-
Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related Legal
Proceedings, the Indemnified Party may make that payment and the Indemnifying
Party shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the
Indemnified Party for that payment unless the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.13. If the amount of any liability of the
Indemnified Party under the Third-Party Claim in respect of which that
payment was made, as described in the preceding sentence, is finally
determined to be less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, forthwith after receipt
of the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of the difference to
the Indemnifying Party.



Section 7.06 _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party
fails to assume control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to contest, settle or pay
the amount claimed, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
settlement effected without its consent. If the Indemnifying Party does assume
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party unless the settlement includes a full release in favour of
the Indemnified Party.



Section 7.07 _Co-operation_. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall co-operate fully with each other with respect to Third-Party Claims,
and shall keep each other fully advised with respect to Third-Party Claims
(including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it
becomes available).



Section 7.08 _INDEMNIFICATION IN CASE OF STRICT LIABILITY OR INDEMNITEE
NEGLIGENCE_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE VII SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED UPON PAST, PRESENT OR
FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT OR
FUTURE BULK SALES LAW, ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER
ACT, OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW OR PRODUCTS LIABILITY, SECURITIES OR
OTHER APPLICABLE



 

55 LAW) AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY)
ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED UPON THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY.



Section 7.09 _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Loss otherwise recoverable by
an Indemnified Party under this Article VII shall be reduced to the extent of
any Tax benefits actually realized by as a result of the matters giving rise
to the Indemnified Partys Claim. Any indemnification obligation by Buyer or
Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be increased by the relevant After
Tax Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, " _After Tax Amount_ " means any
additional amount necessary to reflect the actual Tax consequences of the
receipt or accrual of such indemnification payment (including the payment of
an additional amount or amounts hereunder).



Section 7.10  _Insurance Benefits_. If any matter giving rise to a Claim of
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII by an Indemnified Party is
covered by any insurance policy or policies, then the Indemnified Party shall
use reasonable efforts to pursue the Claim and obtain compensation from its
insurer or insurers under those insurance policy or policies. If and when the
compensation is actually received from those insurers for the matters giving
rise to the Claim of indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
reduce the Claim against the Indemnifying Party to the extent of its insurance
recovery (minus reasonable expenses incurred in pursuing the Claim with its
insurer) or, if payment has already been made by the Indemnifying Party on
the Claim of indemnification hereunder, then the Indemnified Party shall remit
the insurance recovery (minus reasonable expenses incurred in pursuing the
Claim with its insurer), up to the amount of the payment, to the Indemnifying
Party. 



Section 7.11 _Subrogation_. In the event any Indemnifying Party has paid a
Claim asserted by any Indemnified Party under this Agreement, and the
Indemnified Party possesses any Claim against a Third Party in respect of the
Claim previously paid, then the Indemnifying Party shall be fully subrogated
to the rights of the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim against the
Third Party, and the Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable action
requested by the Indemnifying Party to enable the Indemnifying Party to
enforce the Claim against that Third Party.



Section 7.12 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnity payments
made by Seller or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price paid with respect to the
Purchased Assets.



Section 7.13 _Limitations on Liability_.



(a) No Losses arising out of a particular breach of any representation
or warranty hereunder on the part of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
that would otherwise be indemnified under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.02(a),
as the case may be, shall be recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to
the provisions of this Article VII, and no claim therefor shall be asserted
for any purpose hereunder (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no such Losses
shall be counted towards the Indemnity Basket), unless the amount of such
Losses (together with Losses arising out of any substantially related claims)
exceeds $25,000, in which case the entire amount of such Losses shall be
recoverable pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII;



 

56 (b) No Losses arising out of a particular breach of any representation or
warranty hereunder on the part of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, that
would otherwise be indemnified under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.02(a), as
the case may be, shall be recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the
provisions of this Article VII until the amount of such partys Losses equals
or exceeds $4,000,000 (the " _Indemnity Basket_ ") in the aggregate upon which
the entire amount of such Losses shall be recoverable pursuant to the
provisions of this Article VII, including the amount of the Indemnity Basket.



(c) The aggregate amount of Losses arising out of all breaches of any
representations or warranties on the part of Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, recoverable by Buyer and Seller, respectively, pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.02(a), as the case may be, shall be limited
to $60,000,000, respectively, except any Loss relating to breaches of Section
3.06(b) and Section 3.07(b) for which the limit will be the Purchase Price.



(d) Recovery by Buyer or Seller shall in no event include any incidental
damages or loss of profit whatsoever (except to the extent Buyer or Seller is
liable for such damages to any other Person), and, if the Closing shall not
have occurred, shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket expenses.



Section 7.14 _Sole Remedy_. The provisions of this Article VII shall provide
the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Losses arising from
the matters referred to in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, as the case may be,
or otherwise under or in connection with the Purchased Assets, the Business,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this
Section 7.14 shall limit or restrict the ability or right of any party hereto
to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for any breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.



ARTICLE VIII



_SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_



Section 8.01 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely

environmental matters or a claim based on intentional misrepresentation or
fraud, until the end of the second anniversary of the Closing Date;



(b) in the case of a claim in respect of the representations and warranties

that Tax matter;



(c) in the case of a claim in respect of a representation and warranty

Section 8.02 _Survival of Covenants_. Any provision of this Agreement that is
capable of being performed after, but that has not been performed at or
before, the time of the Closing and all covenants of the parties contained in
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the indemnity covenants) or in
any agreement or other document delivered or given pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless consented to in
writing by that party. The failure of any of the parties to enforce at any
time any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall
in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way
to affect the validity of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any
part of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the right of any party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
or non-compliance of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary

negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and communications of the parties,
oral or written, respecting such subject matter. There are no restrictions,
promises, representations, warranties, agreements or undertakings of any party
hereto with respect to the transactions under this Agreement, the Audit
Reimbursement Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, other than those set

69 Section 9.07 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended only by a written
instrument executed by the parties or their respective successors or assigns.



Section 9.08 _Successors in Interest; No Third-Party Beneficiaries;
Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
Seller and Buyer and their respective successors or assigns. Except as
provided in or contemplated by Article VII (which shall confer upon the
Persons referred to therein for whose benefit it is intended the right to
enforce such Article), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Except with the written
consent of the other party, no assignment of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, may be made by
any party, other than to an Affiliate of such party (but no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as any such Affiliate agrees in writing
to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement, Buyer may (i) assign
any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates, and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (and in such case Buyer nonetheless shall remain
directly and primarily responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder).



Section 9.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the law of the
State of New York without reference to choice of law principles, including
all matters of construction, validity and performance, or conflict of laws
under the laws of the State of New York.



Section 9.10 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of Seller and Buyer
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York, New York
County for any actions, suits, or proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each of Seller
and Buyer agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in such courts), and further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address
set forth above shall be effective service of process of any action, suit or
proceeding brought against Seller or Buyer in any such court. Each of Seller
and Buyer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in such state or federal
courts as aforesaid and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND ABSOLUTELY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY, AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO
EFFECT SUCH WAIVER.



Section 9.11 _Schedules_. Any information disclosed pursuant to any Schedule
hereto shall be deemed to be disclosed to Buyer for all purposes of this
Agreement. Neither the specification of any Dollar amount or any item or
matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific
item or matter in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount,
or higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so specified or included, or
other items



 

70 or matters, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
specification of any such amount or the specification or inclusion of any
such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any provision
of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items
or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no party
shall use the fact of the specification or the inclusion of any such item or
matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
item or matter is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of
this Agreement. Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by
notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement or amend any
Schedule hereto, including one or more supplements or amendments to correct
any matter which would constitute a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation contained herein. No such supplemental or amended
Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach for purposes of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.02(a). If, however, the Closing occurs, any
such supplement and amendment will be effective to cure and correct for all
other purposes any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
which would have existed if Seller had not made such supplement or amendment,
and all references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as
provided in this Section 9.11 shall for all purposes after the Closing be
deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as so supplemented or amended.



Section 9.12 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Seller makes no representations or
warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or forward-looking
statements made available to Buyer. There is no assurance that any projected
or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE EXPRESS
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III, SELLER IS SELLING
THE ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III, SELLER DISCLAIMS
ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY
INDUSTRY CUSTOM OR COURSE OF DEALING. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS
NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that none of Seller, its Affiliates, any of their respective
representatives or any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda,
charts, summaries, schedules or other information that is not included in
this Agreement or the Schedules hereto heretofore made available by Seller,
its Affiliates or their respective representatives to Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or their respective representatives, and none of Seller, its
Affiliates, any of their respective representatives or any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or their
respective representatives resulting from the distribution of any such
information to, or the use of any such information by, Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives.
