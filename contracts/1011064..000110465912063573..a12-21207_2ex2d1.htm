Section 3.11 _Employee Matters_. (a) Each material Company Benefit Plan is
listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and a true and
correct copy of each material Company Benefit Plan has been made available to
the Buyer. Except to the extent specifically made available to the Buyer, as
of the date hereof there are no amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that

to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit
Plan that could have a material cost impact on the Management Business.

 



 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in accordance with its terms and Laws, except as would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Management Business. There are no actions, suits or
claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened or anticipated, with respect to any such Company
Benefit Plan which have had or would be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Management

nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has
engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 **** or
4212 **** of ERISA.

 



 

(e) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the

due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit
Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in
full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date
hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements. Each Company
Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of
ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" with the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is
unfunded.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation

in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided,
to any Company Employee or director or independent contractor of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
individual, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation. No amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability
with respect to an obligation to provide health or other non-pension benefits
to any Person beyond his or her retirement other than coverage mandated by
Law.

 



 

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code has been operated
in good-faith compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code.

 



 

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, (i) the favorable tax treatment of any
material Company Benefit Plan maintained outside the U.S. (a " _Non-US Plan_
") is not the subject of examination or pending cancellation by the relevant
tax authority, (ii) there has been no act or omission on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in relation to any Non-US Plan that could
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the imposition of a material
penalty tax, fine, contribution notice or financial support direction deriving
from applicable law, (iii) each Non-US Plan has been maintained in all
material respects in compliance with any minimum funding standards of
applicable law, and (iv) no Company Employee has a contractual right to
participate in any Non-U.S. Plan which is an occupational defined benefit ****
pension plan, and no Non-US Plan entitles any **** Company Employee to early

the Company shall cooperate with the other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have

other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Law with respect
to the Management Business Sale, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority

would limit the freedom of the Buyer, the Management Business LLC, or their
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in
each case as may be required in order to effect the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Management Business Sale set forth in Article VII prior to
the End Date and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or
delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
neither the Seller, the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any Order, requirement, condition, understanding or agreement of
or with a Governmental Authority to sell, to license, to hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise

Affiliates, unless such Order, requirement, condition, understanding or
agreement is binding on the Company only in the event that the Management
Business Sale occurs; and (ii) nothing in this Section 6.1 shall require, or
be construed to require (x) the Buyer, the Seller, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to sell, divest, license or dispose of or hold
separate (or to propose or agree to sell, divest, license or dispose of or
hold separate), before or after the Closing, any assets or businesses of the
Buyer, the Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, if
such action would be reasonably expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
result in (after giving effect to any reasonably expected proceeds of any
sale, divestiture, license or disposition) a Material Adverse Effect on the
Management Business or (y) any Affiliate of the Buyer (other than Subsidiaries
of the Buyer) to sell, divest, license or dispose of or hold separate (or to
propose or agree to sell, divest, license or dispose of or hold separate),
before or after the Closing, any assets or the businesses of any such

(e) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, in connection with
obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental
Authority) with respect to the Management Business Sale or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) if reasonably requested in
writing by the Buyer, the Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries or shall

to the extent practicable, all in such order, form and substance as reasonably
requested by the Buyer, and (ii) without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Significant Joint
Ventures shall take any action, agree to take any action or consent to the
taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.1 (including with respect to
selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its
business in a specified manner).

 



 

Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. Subject to the restrictions imposed by
the HSR Act, federal and state securities Laws and other Laws, the Company
will provide, will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to provide, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Significant Joint Ventures to provide the Buyer, its Affiliates and their
respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice (a) such access to the offices, properties, Company
Facilities, books and records of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Significant Joint Ventures (so long as such

 



      
 

 



 

access does not interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, its Significant Joint Ventures or the Company
Facilities) as the Buyer reasonably may request and (b) all documents that the
Buyer reasonably may request. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Buyer, its
Affiliates and their Representatives shall not have access to any books,
records, documents and other information (i) to the extent prohibited by the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) to the extent
that the disclosure thereof would, in the opinion of the Companys counsel, be
reasonably likely to result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or (iii)
to the extent required by Law. All information exchanged pursuant to this
Section 6.2 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public announcement
as may be required by Law or court process, shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement without the consent of the other
parties (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Buyer and the
Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable joint press release announcing
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer
will cause the Management Business LLC and all of its Subsidiaries to honor,
to the extent required by their respective terms, each of the Company Benefit
Plans. The Buyer shall cause the Management Business LLC and each of its
Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, to maintain for each employee of the Management Business
LLC or any of its Subsidiaries at the Closing ("Current Employee") (i) an
annual rate of base salary and annual cash target bonus opportunity no less
favorable, in each case, than the annual rate of base salary and annual cash
target bonus opportunity provided to such Current Employee immediately prior
to the Closing, and (ii) compensation and employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and employee benefits
provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit the right of the
Buyer, the Management Business LLC or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any Current Employee at any time in a manner consistent with
any applicable contractual obligations, Company Benefit Plans, or Law.

 



 

(b) As of and after the Closing, the Buyer will, or will cause the Management
Business LLC to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under any Company
Benefit Plans or under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or other
arrangement of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, in each case which provides
benefits to any Current Employees as of and after the Closing (each, a "
_Buyer Plan_ ") for such Current Employees service prior to the Closing with
the Management Business LLC and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities, to the same extent such service is recognized by the Management
Business LLC or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (other than
as would result in a duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plan). With respect to each Buyer Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the
Buyer or its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any preexisting
condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to the Current Employees and their eligible
dependents and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for
purposes of satisfying any deductible and

 



      
 

 



 

maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and
amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees and their eligible dependents under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries in which such
Current Employees and their eligible dependents participated immediately prior
to the Closing.

 



 

(c) For one (1) year following the Closing, each Current Employee will
continue to be eligible for severance benefits in amounts, terms and
conditions no less generous than those which applied to such Current Employee
under the severance plans, programs, policies, agreements and other
arrangements of the Company immediately prior to the Closing and as are set
forth on Section 6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(d) If the Closing occurs prior to the payment of bonuses for the 2012
calendar year under the Companys existing annual cash bonus programs (the "
_Existing Programs_ "), the Buyer will, or will cause the Management Business
LLC to, pay to each Current Employee who is otherwise eligible to earn a cash
bonus for calendar year 2012 under the Existing Programs and who either (i)
remains employed through the payment date of such bonuses, or (ii) is
involuntarily terminated without "cause" (as defined in the Companys form of
Separation Pay Agreement as in effect on the date hereof) after the Closing
but prior to such payment date, no less than such Current Employees target-
level bonus in a cash lump sum on a date consistent with past practice and in
no event later than March 15, 2013. If the Closing occurs after December 31,
2012 and before January 1, 2014, immediately prior to the effective time of
the Holding Company Merger, the Company shall pay each Company Employee who is
otherwise eligible to earn a cash bonus for calendar year 2013 under the
Existing Programs a bonus no less than (x) such Company Employees target-
level bonus award under the applicable Existing Program, multiplied by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including
January 1, 2013 through and including the effective date of the Holding
Company Merger and the denominator of which is 365.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, the Buyer,
the Management Business LLC or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Management Business LLC and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing; or (iii) to confer upon
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with the Buyer, the
Management Business LLC or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Management Business LLC and its Subsidiaries), or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Company Reorganization; Owned Land Parcels Sale_. (a) The
Company shall (i) subject to clause (ii), take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Law to effect the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Reorganization in all material respects, including each of the
transactions set forth on Exhibit 1, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be
done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to effect
any modifications to the Company Reorganization reasonably requested by the
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to clause (ii) (x) the
Company shall not be required to take any action that would be reasonably
likely to adversely affect, or prevent or delay, the consummation of the
Mergers, the ability of the shareholders of the Company to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Companys ability to observe and perform its obligations
under the Merger Agreement and (y) the parties agree that the transactions set
forth on Exhibit 1 (or any modifications thereto) shall be modified, at

with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in

a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,

the parties to this Agreement. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties to this Agreement in
accordance with Section 9.5 without notice or liability to any other Person.

represent an allocation among the parties to this Agreement of the risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
parties to this Agreement. Consequently, Persons other than the parties to
this Agreement may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
