- ii \- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this "
_Agreement_ "), dated February 6, 2011, is by and among Danaher Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Djanet Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_
"), and Beckman Coulter, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed
to such terms in _Section 9.5_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this
Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has
agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time, the
" _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the Companys
Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the " _Shares_ "), at a price per
Share of $83.50 (such amount or any different amount per Share that may be
paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer
Price_ ");

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the
Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company with the Company
as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ ," and together with the Offer
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
_Transactions_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share not
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company (other than
Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price
in cash, without interest, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein (i) determined that the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Companys
stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the
extent applicable, adopt this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 T _he Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven
(7) business days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent   shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for
cash all Shares at the Offer Price.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:
(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares which, together with the
Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser (if any), represents at
least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted
basis) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in
_Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").
Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other Offer Conditions,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in
accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
possible after Purchaser is legally permitted to do so after the Expiration
Time. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Offer. In circumstances in which the stockholders of
the Company do not have the right to seek remedies at law or equity, the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement are material to the
Companys execution of this Agreement and any failure by Parent or Purchaser
to comply with the terms of this Agreement shall enable the Company to seek
all remedies available at law or equity to it and on behalf of the
stockholders.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Offer
Conditions. Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer, or to waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions;
_provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as
previously approved in writing by the Company, Purchaser shall not (i)
decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv)
amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or impose conditions to the Offer
that are different than or in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or
waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) amend or modify any of the terms of the
Offer in a manner that is, or could reasonably be expected to be, adverse to
the holders of Shares, or (vii) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time
in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement. 

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is twenty (20) business days following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to which
the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later
time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Time_
").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled
Expiration Time, the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied, or waived
by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to
ten (10) business days each until the Offer Conditions are satisfied or
waived; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the date that is twenty (20) business days after the
satisfaction of the HSR Condition, provided that such date shall be no
earlier than June 30, 2011 and no later than December 31, 2011 (such date, the
" _Outside Date_ ").

 



 

- 2 \- (ii) _Required by Applicable Law or the NYSE_. Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law, interpretation or
position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (or its
staff) or the NYSE.

 

(f) If necessary or desirable to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to
the exercise of the Top-Up Option) to reach the Short Form Threshold,
Purchaser shall provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more
extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d­11 under the Exchange Act of
up to twenty (20) business days, as determined by Purchaser in consultation
with the Company, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment,
and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for
the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with
the terms of this _Section 1.1(f)_.

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ prior to any
scheduled Expiration Time, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as
exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments
and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall
promptly (and in any event no later than three (3) business days following
Parent or Purchasers request) furnish to Parent and Purchaser all
information concerning the Company or any of its Representatives requested by
Parent or Purchaser and required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to
all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO
or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and
Purchaser shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

(i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change

 



 

- 3 \-  with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior
to Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer; _provided_  that nothing in this _Section 1.1(i)_
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable on the date of the filing of the Schedule TO,
the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that
shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2_, contain the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. Unless the Company Board of Directors has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. Unless the Company Board of Directors has effected a
Change of Recommendation, Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. Unless the
Company Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation, the Parent
and Purchaser may include in the Offer Documents and the Proxy Statement the
Company Board Recommendation (including as contained in the Schedule 14D-9).

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) business days following the date of this Agreement)
furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security
position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the
names and addresses of the record and beneficial holders of the Shares as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with
such information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of
record and beneficial holders of the Shares, updated from time to time upon
Purchasers request, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security
positions) as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.
Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver
(and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their agents
and Representatives to deliver) to the Company all copies and any extract or
summaries of such information. In addition, in connection with the Offer,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Purchaser to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Equity
Plan or other Benefit Plans and to permit such holders of Shares to tender
Shares in the Offer. 

 



 

- 4 \- Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied, promptly after Purchaser
accepts for payment and pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), and at all times
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board
of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on
the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent
and Purchaser bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; _provided_
, _however_ , that, subject to applicable Law and the rules of the NYSE,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors
on the Company Board of Directors at all times following the Appointment Time.
Upon Purchasers request at any time following the Appointment Time, the
Company shall take such actions, including but not limited to filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors,
increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by amending
the Company Bylaws if necessary so as to increase the size of the Company
Board of Directors) and/or requesting and accepting the resignations of such
number of its incumbent directors, as is reasonably necessary to enable
Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors, and shall cause Purchasers designees to be so elected or
designated at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following
the Appointment Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to
constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number)
as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company
Board of Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each
Company Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such
board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of
the NYSE. The Companys obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take
all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to
stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9, unless otherwise requested by
Parent) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary to enable Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and
solely be responsible for, information with respect to Purchasers designees
and Parents and Purchasers respective officers, directors and affiliates
to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of
this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that
any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a
record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law
with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

 

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of Directors
on the date hereof, each of whom shall be "independent" for purposes of Rule
10A-3 of the Exchange Act and also eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least one of whom shall
be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided, however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due
to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Company Board of Directors) so
that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate
another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or
Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three (3) Persons who shall each qualify as "independent" for
purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least
one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board
of Directors after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, then
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in
addition to the

 



 

- 5 \-  approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the stockholders of the
Company as may be required by the Company Governing Documents or applicable
Law) be required for the Company (i) to amend or terminate this Agreement,
(ii) to extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, or to exercise or
waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such
action would adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser), (iii) except as provided herein, to amend the Company Governing
Documents in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any
other action or make any other determination of the Company Board of Directors
under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser). The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the
Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which
may include current counsel to the Company or the Board of Directors) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement.

in accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law and this
Agreement (including _Section 5.2_ and _Section 8.1_):

(i) (A) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Appointment Time,
duly set a record date for, and take all action necessary in accordance with
the DGCL and the Company Governing Documents to duly call and give notice of
a special meeting of its stockholders (such meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger (with the
record date and meeting date set in consultation with Purchaser), and (B) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Appointment Time, convene and
hold the Special Meeting (and adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting
in accordance with Purchasers direction);

(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Appointment Time,
file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to its stockholders; and

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) secure any approval
of stockholders of the Company that is required by the DGCL and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it,
Purchaser or any of their other Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the
Company, any other approvals that are required by the DGCL and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

Section 1.10 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the
terms of _Section 1.9_, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Subsidiaries shall hold, in the aggregate, at least ninety percent
(90%) of the outstanding Shares (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") following the
Appointment Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering
period" provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, if applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if
applicable, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to become effective
promptly, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Section 1.11 _Top-Up Option_. 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and only on or after the Appointment Time, to purchase, at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price, an aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares directly or indirectly owned
by Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries at the time of exercise
of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent
(90%) of the Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares on a fully diluted basis; _provided, however_ , that the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and
the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form
Threshold would be reached (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares); _provided, further_ , that in no event shall the Top-
Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of
the Companys total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock (treating
any Shares held in the treasury of the Company as unissued). Purchaser may pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares
either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at Purchasers election, by (x) paying in
cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price
pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the
preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note
shall be full recourse against Parent and

 



 

- 8 \-  Purchaser and (i) shall bear interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per
annum, (ii) shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law, order, injunction or other legal
impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or
issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise (subject to the restrictions
contained in _Section 1.11(a)_) the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions,
in whole or in part, after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the fifth (5th) business day after the later of (A) the
Expiration Time and (B) the expiration of any "subsequent offering period";
and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) Each time that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ,"
the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_
") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up
Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt
of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Purchaser
confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price
therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser
shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up
Option Shares, by delivery of cash and a Promissory Note in an aggregate
principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the
Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or
certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the Company does not
then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares.
Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are
required by federal or state securities Laws.

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares which Purchaser
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under
the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that
Purchaser is, or shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by
Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by
Purchaser other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted
assignment in violation of this  _Section 1.11(e)_ shall be null and void.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or common stock of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser
Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. From

 



 

- 9 \-  and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Purchaser Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares owned by the Company
and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled or
converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable
to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest
thereon.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to or promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration with respect to Shares converted into Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.1(c)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Purchaser to, promptly deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one
year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) business days), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make available
for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares
were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the 

 



 

- 10 \-  Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A)
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, without
interest thereon.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the
Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is
pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures,
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof;
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against 

 



 

- 11 \-  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights (it being understood that at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal
Rights); _provided, however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to rights of appraisal, and Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees that in any appraisal
proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option
Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by Purchaser to the Company as
payment for any Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in connection with
the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 262(h) of the DGCL.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Phantom Stock Units_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, (i)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), or stock appreciation right or portion
thereof whether settled in cash or Shares (the " _SARs_ ") under any stock
option plan of the Company, including the 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan,
the 2004 Long-Term Performance Plan, the 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan, the
Share Participation Scheme in Ireland, the Stock Purchase Plan for employees
in Japan, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, including any foreign equity plan, agreement or
arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), shall become
immediately vested and exercisable in full, (ii) the holders of such Company
Options and SARs shall have the right to exercise such Company Options and
SARs, to the extent then exercisable, until immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) with respect to any Company Options and SARs that remain
outstanding and are unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all such Company Options and SARs shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefore, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option or SAR shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option or SAR and in settlement therefore, a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total

 



 

- 12 \-  number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option or SAR and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share previously subject to such Company Option or SAR (such amount being

its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 4.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_. Each
of Parent and Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The

and the consummation by each of them of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and
Purchaser, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Purchaser, and no other corporate action on the part of either
Parent or Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by
Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent
and Purchaser and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Company, is the valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Purchaser enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (b) general principles

authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under the HSR Act
and any other Required Governmental Approvals, or (iv) such filings with the

connection with this Agreement and the Offer and the Merger), or (c) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to Parent or Purchaser, any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their properties
or assets, except in the case of clause (b) or (c), such violations, breaches
or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any
material respect the ability of each Parent or Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions.

Section 4.4 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal
Proceeding pending against (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
or naming as a party thereto) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is there any investigation of a Governmental Entity
pending or threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction or decree, in each case, which would, individually or in the
aggregate, impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement, as the case
may be, or prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions.

Section 4.5 _Information in the Proxy Statement_. None of the information
supplied by Parent or Purchaser expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) will, at the date mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the
time of the meeting of the Companys stockholders to be held in connection
with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.

Section 4.6 _Information in the Offer Documents_. The Offer Documents
(and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, when filed with
the SEC or at the time of distribution or dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to statements made
therein based on information supplied by the Company in writing expressly for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply as to form
in all material respects with applicable federal securities Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

Section 4.7 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent,
Purchaser nor any of their respective affiliates is, nor at any time during
the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Section 4.8 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent will have upon the Appointment
Time, at the Expiration Time (as the same may be extended from time to time
pursuant to this Agreement) and at the Effective Time, the funds necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and to pay all fees and expenses
incurred by Parent, Purchaser and the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions for which Parent or Purchaser is responsible.

 

Section 4.9 _Ownership and Operations of Purchaser_. Parent (or a direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent) owns beneficially and of
record all of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser. Purchaser was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no
other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.11 _Investigation; Limitation on Warranties; Disclaimer of
Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Purchaser has
conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, intellectual property, technology, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Purchaser has been
provided access to personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for such purposes. In entering into this
Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser has relied solely upon its independent
investigation and analysis of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and
each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has not been
induced by and has not relied upon any representations, warranties or
statements, whether express or implied, made by the Company, any
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders,
controlling persons or Company representatives that are not expressly set
forth in this Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or
statements were made in writing or orally. Each of Parent and Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective
affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Company representatives
shall not have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent,
Purchaser, any Parent Subsidiary, or their respective affiliates,
stockholders, controlling persons or Parent representatives on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or
otherwise) based upon any information (including any statement, document or
agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any financial statements
and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided
or made available (including in any data rooms, management presentations,
information or descriptive memorandum or supplemental information), or
statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Purchaser, any
Parent Subsidiary, affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Parent
Representatives, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this
Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Letter). Parent and
Purchaser each acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) the Company does not
make, or has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or
its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent and
Purchaser are not relying on any representation or warranty except for those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, (b) no Person has been authorized by
the Company to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its
business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such

having been authorized by such party and (c) any estimates, projections,
predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any
other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Purchaser or

(v) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives
(other than the parties hereto) conducted heretofore or that may be ongoing
with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal, (ii) obtain the prompt return or destruction of all information
previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and written

beneficiary.

(c) The Company promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours)
shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Competing Proposal and of
any determinations made by the Company or the Company Board of Directors with
respect to any Competing Proposal and (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, including the
terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent apprised on a current basis of the status (including any material
change to the terms thereof) of any such Competing Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, if the
Company receives prior to the Appointment Time an unsolicited bona fide
written Competing Proposal, which in the good faith determination of the
Company Board of Directors, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) could
reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions
referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal from
the proponent of the Competing Proposal, the Company may, prior to the
Appointment Time, take the following actions (but only if and to the extent
that the Company Board of Directors first concludes in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law and provides Parent with prior notice): (x) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the
third party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage
in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Competing Proposal; _provided, however_ , that as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) following the
Company taking such actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, the
Company shall (A) provide the notice and information set forth in _Section
5.2(g)_ hereof, including without limitation written notice to Parent of such
Competing Proposal, the determinations of the Company Board of Directors as
provided for in clauses (i)­(ii) above, as applicable, and actions taken by
the Company and its Representatives (with respect to which the Company shall
keep Parent apprised on a current basis) and (B) provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company provided to such third party which
was not previously provided to Parent.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, prior to
the Appointment Time, the Company Board of Directors may, with prompt (and in
any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notice to Parent, effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Effect occurring after the date hereof, other
than of or relating to a Competing Proposal, if the Company Board of
Directors has concluded in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisors that the failure of the Company Board of
Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
exercise of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholder under applicable Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, if the
Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors that a

 



 

- 34 \-  Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (and remains such after
taking into account any proposals offered by Parent or Purchaser) and that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law,
then the Company Board of Directors may prior to the Appointment Time cause
the Company to, after complying with  _Section 5.2(g)_ hereof and paying
Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.2_, enter into a
binding written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate
this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 8.1_.

(g) Neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors shall take any of
the actions described in _Section 5.2(f) _or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(v)_, in each case, unless (i) the Company shall
have complied in all material respects with this _Section 5.2_, (ii) the
Company shall have given Parent and Purchaser prompt (but in any event,
within forty-eight (48) hours) written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") advising them of the decision of the Company Board of Directors
to take such action, detailing the terms and conditions of the Competing
Proposal that serves as the basis of such action and including copies of any
definitive document or correspondence evidencing such Competing Proposal, and
(iii) (A) the Company shall have given Parent and Purchaser three (3)
business days after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement and/or the Transactions (and/or make any other proposals)
and during such time shall have negotiated and caused its Representatives to
negotiate (if Parent and the Purchaser have notified the Company that they
desire to negotiate), confidentially and in good faith with Parent and
Purchaser so as to have such Competing Proposal cease to qualify as
a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors and considering the results of such negotiations and giving
effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications offered by Parent and
Purchaser, that such Competing Proposal nevertheless remains a Superior
Proposal and that failing to take the actions described in _Section 5.2(f)_,
as applicable, or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(v)_, in each case as sought to be taken, would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
each successive material amendment or material revision to any Superior
Proposal or any material term thereof shall constitute a new Superior
Proposal, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement, including
without limitation with respect to necessitating the delivery of a new Notice
of Superior Proposal, new two (2) business day period and new determinations
by the Company Board of Directors as set forth herein. The Company shall keep
Parent apprised of any such amendments or revisions or other developments
with respect thereto.

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with any applicable Law; _provided,_ that any such disclosure(s) (other than
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication confined to the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation under _Section 5.2(a)_ hereof unless the
Company Board of Directors expressly and unconditionally reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days of a request by
Parent or Purchaser.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate as if made as of any time prior to the Effective Time, such that
the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ or _Article VII_ may not be satisfied;
_provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this

and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or

Parent apprised of all developments (whether beneficial or adverse) with
respect to regulatory matters, including on-going remediation and other
efforts concerning the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, and any other
inquiries, investigations or litigation set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, including the status thereof and any changes thereto. The Company
shall also provide Parent with copies of internal reports, financial data and
interim results as prepared in the ordinary course by Company personnel for
review by senior management contemporaneously with circulation of such

Section 6.2 _Access; Confidentiality_. From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall, upon reasonable prior notice, give Parent and Purchaser,
their officers and a reasonable number of their employees and their
authorized Representatives, (a) reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Company Agreements, contracts, books, records, analysis, data,
regulatory materials, projections, reports, plans, systems, senior
management, commitments, offices and other facilities and properties of the
Company and (b) such other information and personnel as Parent or Purchaser
may reasonably request. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
to any information provided to Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
6.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company
shall not be required to provide access to, or to disclose information, to the
extent such access or disclosure would (i) jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or (ii) contravene any applicable Law or contractual
restriction, in each case in a manner materially detrimental to the Company;
_provided_ , that in either such case, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in seeking all necessary exemptions, permits or other consents or
approvals to permit the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide Parent
access to such information.

 

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the Outside Date
(which, for purposes of this Section 6.3, shall be December 31, 2011), (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, clearances approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act
and any other antitrust or competition Law or regulation (the " _Required
Governmental Approvals_ "), in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii)
make or cause to be made the applications or filings required to be made by
Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries under
or with respect to the HSR Act, any other applicable Required Governmental
Approvals or any other applicable Laws in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, (iv) comply at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any
request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any other Required
Governmental Approvals and any such other applicable Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity

 



 

- 36 \-  in connection with such applications or filings or the Transactions, and (v)
coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection
with, making (A) any filing under or with respect to the HSR Act, any other
Required Governmental Approvals or any such other applicable Laws and (B) any
filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any
investigation or other inquiry by any such Governmental Entity. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commit to any and
all divestitures, licenses or hold separate or similar arrangements with
respect to its assets or conduct of business arrangements as a condition to
obtaining any and all approvals from any Governmental Entity for any reason in
order to satisfy the HSR Condition and obtain any other Required Governmental
Approval, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
the Outside Date, including taking any and all actions necessary in order to
ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval
of the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no
other matter relating to any antitrust or competition Law or regulation, would
preclude satisfaction of the Offer Conditions by the Outside Date. The
Company shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent, to divest, hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to the
businesses, services, or assets of the Company in furtherance of this 
_Section 6.3_; _provided, however_ , that any such action may be conditioned
upon consummation of the Merger.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, furnish to the other party all information necessary for any
application or other filing to be made in connection with the Transactions.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or
agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such application or
filing. If a party hereto intends to independently participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiry, then such party shall give the other party reasonable prior
notice of such meeting and invite Representatives of the other party to
participate in the meeting with the Governmental Entity unless prohibited by
such Governmental Entity. The parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with all meetings, actions
and proceedings under or relating to any such application or filing;
_provided_ , that materials may be redacted to remove references concerning
the valuation of the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other
under this Section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.

(c) The Company and Parent shall give (and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries
to give) any notices to third parties, and use (and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to obtain any third-party
consents necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, or set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity challenging the
Transactions as violative of any applicable Law, each of the Company and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e) Parent shall vote (or act by written consent with respect to) all of the
shares of capital stock of Purchaser beneficially owned by it in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

- 37 \- Section 6.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other party, unless such party determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market
to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such
party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment
upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto;
_provided, however_ , that, subject to _Section 5.2_ in the case of the
Company, the Company shall not be required to provide any such review or
comment to Parent in connection with any press release or public statement to
be issued or made with respect to a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall
not be required to provide any such review or comment to the Company in
connection with or following a Change of Recommendation; _provided, further_ ,
subject to _Section 5.2_ in the case of the Company, each party hereto and
their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section
6.4_.

 

Section 6.5 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company existing at or prior
to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law,
under the Company Governing Documents in effect on the date hereof and under
any indemnification or other similar agreements in effect on the date hereof
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") to each director and officer covered
by such Company Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements (the "
_Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions
in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.5(a)_, for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against
and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Covered Persons capacity as such, or (B) this Agreement and any of the
Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of any Covered Person upon receipt, to the extent
required by the DGCL, of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise terminate any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of a covered person for which indemnification may
be sought under this  _Section 6.5(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Covered
Person from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including
the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Governing Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons that
survive the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that

 



 

- 38 \-  Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make
aggregate annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premiums paid for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2010 for such insurance (such 300% amount, the " _Base
Premium_ "); _provided, further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Base Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for an aggregate annual premium
not to exceed the Base Premium; _provided, further_ , if the Company in its
sole discretion elects, by giving written notice to Parent at least two (2)
business days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing
insurance, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a
directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance
program for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect
to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or
prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage
limit over the term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the annual
aggregate coverage limit under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be comparable to
such existing coverage).

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.5_.

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_, and this _Section 6.5_ shall not
be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including
their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered
Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

 

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under state
or federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or any
other Transaction, then the Company Board of Directors shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, including taking all necessary actions and
granting such necessary approvals so as to, render such statute (or the
relevant provisions thereof) inapplicable to the foregoing so that the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein.

 

Section 6.7 _Obligations of Purchaser and Company_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The Company shall take all action necessary to cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to comply with the obligations applicable to such Company
Subsidiary under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of two (2) years
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to each employee of the Company who continues to be employed by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation (the "Affected Employees"), (i) a base
salary or regular hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is not less than
the base salary or regular hourly wage provided to such Affected Employee by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) bonus opportunity,
sales and service incentive award compensation opportunity provided to such
Affected Employee by the Company

 



 

- 39 \-  immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits
(excluding defined benefit pension plan benefits and any equity award
opportunities) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to (A)
those provided to such Affected Employee (including all dependents) by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, but in no event less than (B)
those provided to those generally offered from time to time to similarly
situated employees of Parent. Effective as of the Effective Time and
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, that periods of employment with the Company (including,
without limitation, any current or former affiliate of the Company or any
predecessor of the Company) shall, to the extent recognized by the Company, be
taken into account for purposes of determining, as applicable, the eligibility
for participation and vesting of any Affected Employee under all employee
benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent for the benefit
of the Affected Employees, including, without limitation, vacation plans or
arrangements, 401(k) or other retirement plans and any severance or welfare
plans, except as would result in a duplication of benefits. Effective as of
the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (x) reduce any period of limitation on health benefits
coverage of Affected Employees due to pre-existing conditions (or actively at
work or similar) under the applicable health benefits plan of Parent or an
affiliate of Parent by the number of days of an individuals "creditable
coverage," to the extent required by Section 701 of ERISA, (y) except for
insured benefit plans (if required by applicable Law), waive any and all
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements with
respect to such Affected Employees to the extent such eligibility waiting
periods or evidence of insurability requirements were waived with respect to
the Affected Employees under the Benefits Plans and (z) credit each Affected
Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments
paid by such employee under the health benefit plans of the Company or its
affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing
occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee
has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-
of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of
Parent for such year. The Offer and the Merger shall not affect any Affected
Employees accrual of, or right to take, any accrued but unused personal, sick
or vacation days pursuant to any policies applicable to such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

(b) Parent shall maintain and honor, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain and honor, the Companys current severance plan described in
_Schedule 6.8(b)_ until December 31, 2012.

(c) With respect to the defined benefit pension plans maintained by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Schedule
6.8(c) (the "Pension Plans"), Parent shall maintain and honor, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain and honor, the Pension Plans until
December 31, 2011. Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, that each participant in a Pension Plan who is
eligible to receive an accrual of benefits under such Pension Plan as of
the Effective Time shall continue to receive such accruals in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Pension Plan as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time until December 31, 2011. In the event any Pension Plan is
terminated on or following December 31, 2011, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that each participant in such
Pension Plan shall be eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan
with terms and conditions (including, without limitation, employee and
employer contributions) that are substantially similar to the terms and
conditions of a Parent Defined Contribution Plan for similarly situated
employees of Parent in such country or geographic location. " _Parent Defined
Contribution Plan_ " means a Parent defined contribution plan (or a cash
balance plan or hybrid cash balance plan where a defined contribution plan is
not currently in place for similarly situated employees) in effect from time
to time for Parent employees who are not eligible to participate in a defined
benefit pension plan.

(d) With respect to the retiree medical plan maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time for the Affected Employees located in
the United States (the " _Retiree Medical Plan_ "), Parent shall maintain and
honor, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain and honor, the
Retiree Medical Plan until December 31, 2012 (the " _Retiree Medical Plan
Duration Period_ "). Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, that (i) each participant in the Retiree Medical Plan
who is receiving benefits under the Retiree Medical Plan as of the Effective
Time shall continue to receive benefits in accordance

 



 

- 40 \-  with the current terms and conditions of the Retiree Medical Plan during the
Retiree Medical Plan Duration Period, (ii) each Affected Employee and eligible
dependent who is or would become eligible to participate under the current
terms and conditions of the Retiree Medical Plan during the period commencing
with the Effective Time and through December 31, 2012 shall continue to be
eligible to participate in the Retiree Medical Plan during the Retiree
Medical Plan Duration Period (together, with the current participants in the
Retiree Medical Plan, the " _Retiree Medical Plan Participants_ "), and (iii)
in the event the Retiree Medical Plan is terminated following the Retiree
Medical Plan Duration Period, each Retiree Medical Plan Participant shall be
entitled to receive, commencing on the later of the date on which such plan is
terminated and the date such Retiree Medical Plan Participant retires and
would otherwise commence receiving benefits under the plan, an annual amount
equal to the amount of the subsidy that would be paid from time to time by the
Parent or Surviving Corporation based on rates as in effect on the last day of
the Retiree Medical Plan Duration Period depending on the then-current
marital status, number of dependents, and age of the Retiree Medical Plan
Participant (the " _Annual Termination Payment_ "). The Annual Termination
Payment shall be provided in the time, form and medium of payment determined
by the Parent or Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, cash
lump sum or installment payments, through an insurance product or health
reimbursement account or such other means that delivers comparable economic
value to each Retiree Medical Plan Participant.

(e) With respect to each Affected Employee who is assigned to perform
services for the Company outside such Affected Employees home country (each,
an " _Expatriate Employee_ "), in the event the Expatriate Employees
assignment is ended by the Company, Parent or Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time, Parent agrees to pay for or reimburse all reasonable
moving costs incurred by the Expatriate Employee and his or her dependents who
currently reside with the Expatriate Employee to move back to the
Expatriates home county.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Affected Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Affected Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any affiliate of Parent and the Affected Employee. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.8_
shall (x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of
any Benefit Plan or Purchaser employee benefit plan, or (y) create any third
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 6.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 6.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior to the Effective Time, and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Appointment Time, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Board of Directors)
will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors
or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director
or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee

 



 

- 41 \-  benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach by the other party of any

curable, or if curable, has not been cured within ten (10) business days after
the receipt of notice thereof by the defaulting party from the non-defaulting
party); _provided, however_ , this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to

however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of

qualified as such at the time of its determination to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(v)_ and continues to qualify as a Superior
Proposal after the Company has complied with  _Section 5.2(g)_, (B) the
Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) has determined in good

or other Transactions; _provided, however_ , that the party seeking to

Adverse Effect shall have occurred or shall exist, which has not been cured or
ceased to exist within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice thereof by
the Company from Parent;  _provided_ that at the time of such termination,
the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time,
including clauses (c)(iii), (iv) and (v) of Annex I).

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section

the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.3_ through
_Section 9.14_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that
subject to _Section 8.2(d)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto
from liability for a material breach of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement prior to such termination (which the parties acknowledge and
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-ofpocket
costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys
stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total

 



 

- 43 \-  amount payable to such stockholders under this Agreement and the time value
of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company).

 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ and
Parent and Purchaser are not in material breach of this Agreement either at
the time of such termination or at the time of such Change in Recommendation,
the Company shall within three (3) business days of such termination pay
Parent a fee of $165 million in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and, upon the
payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further liability
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions to Parent or Purchaser.

(ii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(v)_, prior to or concurrent with, and as a condition to, the
effectiveness of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee and, upon the payment of the Termination Fee, the Company
shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions to Parent or Purchaser.

 

(iii) If Parent or Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_, or if the Company, Parent or Purchaser terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, and in either case, prior to such
termination a Competing Proposal had been disclosed and not withdrawn and
within six (6) months of either such termination the Company consummates a
transaction with respect to a Competing Proposal or enters into an agreement
providing for a Competing Proposal that is subsequently consummated, the
Company shall, prior to the effectiveness of such consummation, pay to Parent
the Termination Fee.

(iv) For purposes of _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, the term "Competing Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 9.5_, except that
the reference to "at least 20%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal"
shall be deemed to be a reference to "at least 50%" with respect to Competing
Proposals that are consummated or agreements entered into with respect thereto
during the six (6) month period following termination described in Section
8.2(b)(iii).

 

(c) The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay any
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Purchaser, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ hereof, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
any of the amounts payable to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2_, the Company
shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of the amounts so payable at the rate on six (6)-month United States
Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement (other than as set forth in this _Section
8.2(d)_), Parents right to receive payment of the Termination Fee from the
Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser against
the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current
or future officers,

 



 

- 44 \-  directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing contained in
this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any
willful breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. All references
to this Agreement shall be deemed to include references to the "plan of
merger" contained herein (as such term is used in the DGCL). The table of
contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Unless otherwise
indicated, all references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The parties hereto
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement:

(a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements
(except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be amended so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof,
Parent and Purchaser shall be permitted to take the action contemplated by
this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; and

(b) except (i) as provided in _Section 6.5_ and (ii) the right of the
Company, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages in the event of
Parents or Purchasers breach of this Agreement, such agreements are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the 

 



 

- 53 \-  Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Offer and the
Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement and all
claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would result in the application of the Law of any other
state.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and
any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof for any reason other
than the failure to serve in accordance with _Section 9.4_, (vi) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if
(and only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in Delaware or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and (vii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
claim that this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
OFFER AND MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT

 



 

- 54 \-  UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign,
in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (a) Parent, (b) Parent
and one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (c)
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject
to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party hereto of any
obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Further, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent may
elect to transfer its directly or indirectly-held equity interests in
Purchaser to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and
any such transfer shall not result in a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant of Parent or Purchaser herein, _provided_ that such transferee
agrees to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII,_ the parties hereto (on behalf of themselves
and any third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, including the
stockholders of the Company) shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
specifically enforce the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise
provided herein, including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.2(d)_, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

respect to (i) or (ii) are continuing at the scheduled Expiration Time):

(i) any Governmental Entity or court of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action

and such order, decree, injunction, ruling or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable;

(ii) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, or legislation
promulgated or deemed applicable to any Transaction by any Governmental Entity
with appropriate jurisdiction, which prevents, restrains or prohibits the
making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of any Shares by Parent,
Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent, the consummation of the Merger,
Parent or Purchasers full rights of ownership and voting of the Shares or
Parent or Purchasers ownership or operation of the Company, other than the
application of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act;

(iii)(A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 3.2(a)_, shall not be true and correct in all respects except for
such inaccuracies as are not significant in the aggregate, (B) any of the

_3.4_ shall not be true and correct in all material respects, or (C) any other
representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Agreement (without

materiality qualifications and other qualifications based upon the concept of
materiality or similar phrases contained therein) shall fail to be true and
correct in any respect as of the date of this Agreement and as of the then
scheduled Expiration Time and the Effective Time with the same effect as
though made as of the then scheduled Expiration Time and the Effective

case as of such date), except as has not had and would not reasonably be

be true or correct, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred or exist
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and be continuing;

(v) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to

with respect to which such waiver will only be effective with the
written agreement of the Company) in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in its reasonable discretion, in each case, subject to the terms
of this Agreement and applicable Law. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at
any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which
may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 



I-1  ANNEX II

FORM OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

 

BECKMAN COULTER, INC.

********

_FIRST:_ The name of the corporation is:

 

Beckman Coulter, Inc.

_SECOND:_ The address of the corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is National Registered Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101,
in the City of Dover, County of Kent, Delaware 19904. The name of the
corporations registered agent at such address is National Registered Agents,
Inc.

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

_FOURTH:_ The total number of shares of capital stock which the corporation
shall have authority to issue is five hundred (500) shares of Common Stock
with $.01 par value. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Common Stock

Common Stock shall vote together as a single class.

 

 _FIFTH:_ The corporation is to have perpetual existence.

_SIXTH:_ To the fullest extent permitted by law, the private property of the
stockholders shall not be subject to the payment of the corporation debts to
any extent whatever.

 

 _SEVENTH:_ The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation and for
defining and regulating the powers of the corporation and its directors and
stockholders and are in the furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred upon the corporation and its directors by statute:

 

(a) The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors.

 

(b) The by-laws of the corporation may fix and alter, or provide the manner
for fixing and altering, the number of directors constituting the whole
Board. In case of any vacancy on the Board of Directors or any increase in the
number of directors constituting the whole Board, the vacancies shall be
filled by the directors or by the stockholders at the time having
voting power, as may be prescribed in the by-laws. Directors need not be
stockholders of the corporation, and the election of directors need not be by
ballot unless and to the extent that the by-laws so provide. Any one or more
directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the vote or written
consent of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the corporation entitled to be voted at an election of
directors.

 

(c) The Board of Directors shall have the full power and authority to make,
amend or repeal by-laws of the corporation.

 

 _EIGHTH:_ Meetings of stockholders may be held outside the State of Delaware,
if the by-laws so provide. The books of the corporation may be kept outside
of the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from
time to time by the Board of Directors or in the by-laws of the corporation.

 



II-1  _NINTH:_

(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in
paragraph (b) hereof, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article Ninth shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while
a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be
made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf
of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article Ninth or otherwise. The corporation may, by
action of the Board, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification
of directors and officers.

(b) If a claim under this Article Ninth is not paid in full by
the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been
received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for
the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal
counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(c) No provision of this Article Ninth is intended to be construed as
limiting, prohibiting, denying or abrogating any of the general or specific
powers or rights conferred by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware upon the corporation to furnish, or upon any court to award, such
indemnification, or indemnification as otherwise authorized pursuant to the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any

 



II-2   other law now or hereafter in effect. The rights conferred upon indemnitees
in this Article Ninth shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in
this Article Ninth shall be contract rights. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of this Article Ninth that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee
or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate
any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence
or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior
to such amendment or repeal.

(d) The Board of Directors of the corporation may, in its discretion,
authorize the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance for itself and on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss asserted against it or such person or incurred by such person in any
such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not
the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the foregoing paragraph of this Article Ninth or under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

_TENTH:_ To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, a director of the
corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. If
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as so amended, automatically without the necessity of any
action by the corporation or any person. Any repeal or modification of this
provision shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

_ELEVENTH:_ The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to
this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended
are granted subject to this reservation.

 

 _TWELFTH:_ Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware shall not apply to the corporation.

majority of the voting power of the Corporation shall constitute a quorum at
all meetings of the stockholders. In case a quorum shall not be present at
any meeting, a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote
thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be
present. The presiding officer of the meeting or a majority of the shares so
represented may adjourn or postpone the meeting from time to time, whether or
not there is such a quorum. No notice of the time and place of adjourned or
postponed meetings need be given except as required by law. At any such
adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote
shall be represented, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally noticed; but only those stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to
vote at any adjournment or adjournments thereof.

 

SECTION 2.5. _Notice Of Meetings_. Written notice, stating the place, date
and time of the meeting, and the general nature of the business to be
considered, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, at
his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, not less
than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his
or her address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the
Corporation. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as
shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporations
notice of meeting. Meetings may be held without notice if all stockholders
entitled to vote are present, or if notice is waived by those not present in
accordance with Section 6.4 of these Bylaws. Any previously scheduled meeting
of the stockholders may be postponed, and any special meeting of the
stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of Directors upon
public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of
stockholders.

 

SECTION 2.6. _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the
taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing.

by the Board of Directors. Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting
of stockholders and each director shall be elected to serve until his or her
successor shall be elected and shall qualify. A director need not be a
stockholder. In addition to the powers and authorities by these Bylaws
expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors may exercise all such
powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by
statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws required to
be exercised or done by the stockholders.

a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

SECTION 3.3. _Vacancies_. If the office of any director becomes vacant,
the remaining directors in the office, though less than a quorum, by a
majority vote, may appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, who
shall hold office for the unexpired term and until his or her successor shall
be duly chosen. If the office of any director becomes vacant and there are no
remaining directors, the stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders
of shares constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation, at a
special meeting called for such purpose, may appoint any qualified person to
fill such vacancy.

SECTION 3.4. _Removal_. Except as hereinafter provided, any director or
directors may be removed either for or without cause at any time by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power entitled to
vote for the election of directors, at an annual meeting or a special meeting
called for the purpose, and the vacancy thus created may be filled, at such
meeting, by the affirmative vote of holders of shares constituting a majority
of the voting power of the Corporation.

SECTION 3.5. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution
or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors,
designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more
directors of the Corporation.

Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors, or in these By-Laws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it.

SECTION 3.6. _Meetings_. The newly elected directors may hold their first
meeting for the purpose of organization and the transaction of business, if a
quorum be present, immediately after the annual meeting of the stockholders;
or the time and place of such meeting may be fixed by consent of all the
Directors.

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such
places and times as shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Directors.

 

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of
the Board or the President, or by the Secretary on the written request of any
director, on at least one days notice to each director (except that notice to
any director may be waived in writing by such director) and shall be held at
such place or places as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or as
shall be stated in the call of the meeting.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any
committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in any meeting
of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a
meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 

SECTION 3.7. _Quorum_. A majority of the Directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. If at any meeting of the Board of
Directors there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those
present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained,
and no further notice thereof need be given other than by announcement at the
meeting which shall be so adjourned. The vote of the majority of the Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board of Directors unless the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
or these By-Laws shall require the vote of a greater number.

 



III-3  SECTION 3.8. _Compensation_. The Board of Directors shall have the
authority to fix the compensation of directors.

SECTION 3.9. _Action Without Meeting_. Any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting if a written consent thereto is signed
by all members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case
may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the Board of Directors or such committee.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

SECTION 5.1. _Indemnification_.

(A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in
paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article V shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by
a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and
not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Article V or otherwise. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article V shall include any claim made
against the lawful spouse (whether such status is derived by reason
of statutory law, common law or otherwise of any applicable jurisdiction in
the world) of a director or officer for claims arising solely out of his or
her capacity as the spouse

 



III-5   of a director or officer, including such claims that seek damages
recoverable from marital community property, property jointly held by the
director or officer and the spouse, or property transferred from the director
or officer to the spouse; provided, however, that this right shall not include
any claim for any actual or alleged wrongful act of the spouse and that this
right of indemnification shall apply only to actual or alleged wrongful acts
of a director or officer. The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. 

(B) If a claim under this Article V is not paid in full by the Corporation
within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation
to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination
by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

SECTION 5.2. _Non-Exclusivity_. No provision of this Article V
is intended to be construed as limiting, prohibiting, denying or abrogating
any of the general or specific powers or rights conferred by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware upon the Corporation to furnish, or
upon any court to award, such indemnification, or indemnification as
otherwise authorized pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware or any other law now or hereafter in effect. The rights conferred
upon indemnitees in this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. The rights conferred upon indemnitees
in this Article V shall be contract rights. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of this Article V that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or
its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
amendment or repeal.

SECTION 5.3. _Insurance_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may,
in its discretion, authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance for itself and on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss asserted against it or such person or
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the foregoing paragraph of
this Article V or under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

SECTION 5.4. _Limitation on Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. If the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest 

 



III-6   extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended,
automatically without the necessity of any action by the Corporation or any
person. Any repeal or modification of this provision shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at
the time of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE VI

SECTION 6.1. _Certificates of Stock; Uncertificated Shares_. A certificate

owners legal representatives, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as
they may direct, not exceeding double the value of the stock, to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss of any such certificate, or the issuance of any such new
certificate.

and ledgers, or to such other person as the Board of Directors may designate,

shares) shall thereupon be issued. A record shall be made of each transfer
and whenever a transfer shall be made for collateral security, and not
absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer.

 

SECTION 6.4. _Stockholders Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of

dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and

to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall,
unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten

the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors;
and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty days
prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2)
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action of
the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first day on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining
stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 



III-7  SECTION 6.5. _Dividends_. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may, out of funds
legally available therefor at any regular or special meeting, declare
dividends upon stock of the Corporation as and when they deem appropriate.
Before declaring any dividend there may be set apart out of any funds of the
Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as the Board of
Directors from time to time in their discretion deem proper for working
capital or as a reserve fund to meet contingencies or for equalizing
dividends or for such other purposes as the Board of Directors shall deem
conducive to the interests of the Corporation.

SECTION 6.6. _Seal_. The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in

time by resolution of the Board of Directors. 

SECTION 6.9. _Notice and Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is

unless expressly so stated, and any notice so required shall be deemed to be
sufficient if given by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the person entitled thereto at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation, and such notice shall be deemed to
have been given on the day of such mailing. Stockholders not entitled to vote
shall not be entitled to receive notice of any meetings except as otherwise
provided by law. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the
provisions of any law, or under the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or of these By-Laws, a waiver thereof, in
writing and signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to such
required notice.
