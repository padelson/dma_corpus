Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay
the amounts due pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> hereof, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for any of the amounts payable to Parent pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>,
