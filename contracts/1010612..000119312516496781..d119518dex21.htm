calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement_ "), and a certificate of the Company that the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with
the Agreed Accounting Principles. The Company shall provide Parent with
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company, and other Company
documents, to verify the information set forth in the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement prior to the Closing Date. The " _Closing
Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the amount by which the difference
between the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Target Working Capital
exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars

 



20  ($250,000). If the Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If
the Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Merger Consideration shall
be reduced by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. For example, if the
Estimated Closing Working Capital is $10 million and the Target Working
Capital is $11 million, the Closing Adjustment would be $750,000, and
it would reduce the Merger Consideration. If the Estimated Closing Working
Capital is $10.5 million and the Target Working Capital is $10 million, the
Closing Adjustment would be $250,000, and it would increase the Merger
Consideration. In addition, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good faith estimate of (i) the
cash and cash equivalents expected to be on hand as of the Closing Time
determined in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles (the "
_Estimated Cash Balance_ "), (ii) the expected amount of the Closing Date
Indebtedness as of the Closing Time (the " _Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) a calculation of the Merger Consideration payable at
the Closing based on such estimated amounts, and (iv) the amounts to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.7_. The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
access to the books and records of the Company, and other Company documents,
to verify such amounts.

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than the later of (i) the 60th day
following the Closing Date, or (ii) the seventh (7th) Business Days after the
delivery to Parent of the audited financial statements of the Company for 2015
accompanied by the audit opinion letter of Deloitte and Touche LLP thereon, the
Parent will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Member Representative a
statement setting forth its calculation of the Closing Working Capital, which
statement shall contain a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein),
a calculation of Closing Working Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital
Statement_ ") and a certificate of the Parent that the Closing Working
Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles. The Closing Working Capital Statement shall also set forth (A) the
variance, if any, between the Estimated Cash Balance and the actual amount of
the cash and cash equivalents at the Closing Time determined in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles (the " _Actual Cash Balance_ "), (B) the
variance, if any, between the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and the
actual Closing Date Indebtedness as of the Closing Time (the " _Actual Closing
Date Indebtedness_ "), (C) the actual amount of the Merger Consideration
recalculated based upon the actual Closing Working Capital, the Actual
Cash Balance and the Actual Closing Date Indebtedness, and (D) the difference
between the Merger Consideration paid at Closing and the actual amount of the
Merger Consideration as finally determined (the "Post-Closing Adjustment").

 

If the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment, as adjusted pursuant to _Section
2.14(e)_ , if applicable, results in an increase in the Merger Consideration
from that paid at Closing, Parent will pay to the Paying Agent, on behalf of
the holders of the Company Units, an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment (without deduction). Any amount payable by Parent to the Paying
Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.14(b)_ will be paid within three (3)
Business Days of the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
(including any Review Period and/or Resolution Period as may be required
pursuant to _Section 2.14(c)_  or _(d)_ below) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Paying Agent. The
Paying Agent shall distribute to each Company Securityholder who has tendered
before such payment date his, her or its completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal, such holders share of both the

 



21  Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and the the Post-Closing Adjustment
deposited by Parent based upon such holders entitlement to Merger
Consideration computed after the Post-Closing Adjustment. If and to the
extent there are holders of Company Units who have not yet tendered their
letters of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall distribute the remainder of the
payment(s) pursuant to _Section 2.9_.

 

If the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment, as adjusted pursuant to _Section
2.14(e)_ , if applicable, results in a decrease in the Merger Consideration
from that paid at Closing, the Member Representative and Parent shall provide
written instructions to the Escrow Agent within three (3) Business Days of the
final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment (including any Review
Period and/or Resolution Period as may be required pursuant to _Section
2.14(c)_ or _(d)_ below) instructing Escrow Agent to release to Parent from
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Post-
Closing Adjustment and to release the remaining Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company
Securityholders who have tendered before such payment date his, her or its
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal based upon their
entitlement to Merger Consideration after the Post-Closing Adjustment. If and
to the extent there are holders of Company Units who have not yet tendered
their letters of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall distribute the remainder
of the payment(s) pursuant to _Section 2.9_. If the Post-Closing Adjustment
exceeds the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount (the amount by which the
Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount
is referred to hereinafter as the " _Excess Amount_ "), (x) the Member
Representative and Parent shall provide written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Parent all of the funds in
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and (y) the Company Securityholders
shall pay, by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent, an amount equal to such Excess
Amount with each Company Securityholder to pay an amount of such Excess
Amount based upon their entitlement to Merger Consideration after the Post-
Closing Adjustment. At Parents election and sole discretion, Parent may also
recover all or any portion of the Excess Amount from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, in which case the Company Securityholders shall be obligated to
promptly replenish the Indemnity Escrow Amount for any such portion.

 

Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.14(b)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

(c) _Examination and Review_. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital
Statement, Member Representative shall have 45 days (the " _Review Period_ ")
to review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period,
Member Representative and Member Representatives accountants shall have full
access to the books and records of the Company, the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, Parent and/or Parents accountants to the extent that they
relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical
financial information relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as
Member Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections
(defined below), provided that such access shall be in a manner that does not
materially interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

 



22 (d) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Member Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth Member Representatives
objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and
the basis for Member Representatives disagreement therewith (the "
_Statement of Objections_ "). If Member Representative fails to deliver the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the
Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the
case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be
deemed to have been accepted by Member Representative. If Member
Representative delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of
the Review Period, Parent and Member Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the
Statement of Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are
so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the
Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by Parent and Member Representative, shall be
final and binding. 

(e) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Member Representative and Parent fail to
reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for
resolution to an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants appointed by mutual agreement of Parent and
Member Representative (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") who, acting as
experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make
any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Working Capital Statement. The parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively. 

(f) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. Member Representative, solely on
behalf of the Company Securityholders and in its capacity as the Member
Representative and not in its individual capacity, and Parent shall each pay
50% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants. For the avoidance
of doubt, such fees, to the extent paid by the Member Representative, shall
be paid out of the Expense Funds. __

Section 2.15 _Release of Indemnity Escrow_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a Business
Day, then the first (1st) Business Day thereafter) (the " _Escrow Release
Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
holders of Company Units, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the amount by which the Escrow Funds exceed the aggregate amount of
all outstanding and unresolved claims for indemnification hereunder brought
prior to the Escrow Release Date (each, a " _Pending Claim_ ") (such amount,
the " _Escrow Release Amount_ ").

(b) As and to the extent any Pending Claim is resolved in favor of the
Company Securityholders, Parent and the Member Representative shall direct the
Escrow Agent to deliver to the Paying Agent on behalf of the holders of
Company Units the related portion of the remaining amounts in the Escrow
Account as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

 



23 (c) Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of any amount required to
be delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will
pay to each holder of Company Units who has tendered before the Escrow Release
Date his, her or its completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, such
holders Pro Rata Escrow Share of the Escrow Release Amount. If and to the
extent there are holders of Company Units who have not yet tendered their
Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent will cause such amounts to be
distributed pursuant to _Section 2.9_.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Employee_

 



30   _Plans_ "). The Employee Plans have been maintained, funded and
administered in all material respects, including the timely deposit of all
participant elective contributions and loan payments, in accordance with
their terms and are in compliance with applicable Law, including without

and the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, except for
instances of non-compliance that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. To
the extent that the Company has Knowledge that any Qualification Failures as
defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2013-12 have occurred
with respect to any Employee Plan, a summary of such Qualification Failures is
set forth on _Schedule 3.12_ , and the Company shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to correct such failures under the Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution System contained in Revenue Procedure 2013-12 on or

or is a pre-approved volume submitter or prototype plan that is the subject of
an opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Neither the Company

in good faith compliance with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A
and applicable guidance thereunder since January 1, 2008, and (B) amended to
comply in written form with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(ii) With respect to all Employee Plans that are group health plans as
defined in ERISA Section 607(1), sponsored or maintained by the Company, no
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company has engaged in any action
or failed to act in such a manner that, as a result of such action or failure
to act, would cause a Tax to be imposed on the Company under Code Section
4980B(a), or would cause a penalty to be imposed under ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. With respect to all such plans, all
applicable provisions of Code Section 4980B and ERISA Sections 601-606 have
been complied with by the Company, and all other provisions of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder have been complied with.

 

(iii) Neither the Company nor any fiduciary as defined in ERISA Section
3(21)(A) of an Employee Plan has engaged in any transaction that may subject
the Company or any Employee Plan to a civil penalty imposed by ERISA Section
502 or any other provision of ERISA or excise Taxes under Code Section 4971,
4975, 4976, 4977, 4979 or 4980B.

 

(iv) All required reports and descriptions for any Employee Plan have been
timely filed and distributed to participants and beneficiaries, and all
notices required by ERISA or the Code with respect to all Employee Plans have
been proper as to form and timely given.

requirements of the HSR Act, no material filing with or material notice to,
and no material Permit, authorization, consent or approval of, or material

each of Parent and Newco of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where

Section 5.3 _[Reserved_.]

Section 5.5 _[Reserved_.]

 

Section 5.6 _Indemnification of Managers and Officers_. Each of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter Documents as of the

would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or prior to
the Effective Time were directors, officers, agents or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who were otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Company Charter Documents. The Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect for six years after the Effective Time the
current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous than the existing policies
(including with respect to the period covered). The foregoing notwithstanding,
in no event will Parent be required to expend annually in excess of 250% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the
extent the annual premium would exceed 250% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for such coverage, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for
such 250% of such annual premium). Parent will indemnify each individual who
served as a director or officer of the Company at any time prior to the
Closing Date from and against all third party Proceedings, including all

arising out of, or caused by, this Agreement or any of the transactions

Section 5.9 _R andW Policy_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
correct copy of the binder for the RandW Policy. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts and proceed diligently and in good faith to

responsible for sixty percent (60%) of the premium for the RandW Insurance
Policy, which amount shall be characterized as a Seller Expense for purposes
of this Agreement, and Parent shall be responsible for the remainder of the
premium and for all other costs of procuring the RandW Insurance Policy. From
and after the issuance of the RandW Insurance Policy, Parent shall not amend,
modify or otherwise change, terminate or waive any provision of the RandW

the Member Representative including with respect to the waiver of subrogation
set forth therein, without the prior written consent of the Member
Representative.

 

Section 5.10 _Tax Covenants_. __

 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent included as a liability in
determining the Closing Working Capital, the Company Securityholders shall be
liable for and covenant to pay, and pursuant to _Article VIII_ shall reimburse
each Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Account, the amount of any and all
Losses incurred by such Parent Indemnitee as a result of: (i) all Taxes of
the Company and each Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) all Taxes
that the Company or any Subsidiary is liable for (including under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6); (iii) all Taxes of any other Person that the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries is liable for as a result of transferee
liability, successor liability, or a contractual obligation, in each case,
that is attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (iv) all
Taxes resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty contained in
_Section 3.9_ or a covenant contained in this _Section 5.10_ ; and (v) any
Transfer Taxes for which the Company Securityholders are responsible pursuant
to _Section 5.10(g)_.

(b) For purposes of determining the Taxes, the form of interest or penalties
or Taxes for any Straddle Period for which the Company Securityholders or
Parent are liable under _Section 5.10(a)_ , the Company Securityholders, the
Surviving Corporation, and Parent agree as follows:

 

(i) Taxes in the form of interest, penalties, additions to Tax or other
additional amounts that relate to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be treated as occurring in such Pre-Closing Tax Period, whether such items are
incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date;

 

(ii) Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period using the following conventions: (A) in
the

 



45  case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined by
multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and the balance of such Taxes
shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing Tax Period; and (B) in the case of
all other Taxes (including income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use
Taxes) the amount apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as if the Company or the applicable Subsidiary had filed a
separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of
the books methodology," and the balance of such Taxes shall be apportioned to
the Post-Closing Tax Period. For purposes of clause (B), any item determined
on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation
deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be apportioned to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period based on the relative number of days in such portion of
the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period and the balance of such items shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing
Tax Period.

(c) _Tax Returns_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a written engagement agreement with Deloitte
and Touche LLP (" _Deloitte_ ") pursuant to which Deloitte will agree, for the
fixed fee stated in the engagement letter (the " _Deloitte Fee_ "), to
(1) prepare for filing all federal and state income Tax returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries for 2015 and the short 2016 Tax year ending on
the Closing Date, and (2) providing to Parent all of the supporting
documentation for the Companys determination of its adjusted tax basis in
the assets to be included in Class V and Class VI as reflected in Schedule
5.10(i). After the Closing, the Member Representative shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, at its sole expense, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date with
respect to taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (each a "
_Seller Return_ "). Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law or
following such past practice would be reasonably likely to result in the
imposition of penalties for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates). For the avoidance of doubt, the Member Representative
and Parent acknowledge that the Companys final taxable year as a partnership
for federal income Tax purposes shall close as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date, and any items of deduction, expense, income, gain or credit
properly recognized on the Closing Date in accordance with the Companys
method of accounting for federal income Tax purposes will be reported on the
Tax Return filed in respect of such year. Unless otherwise directed by
Parent, the Company shall (and the Company Securityholders and the Member
Representative shall take such action(s) to cause the Company to) file an
election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code with respect to the taxable year
that ends on and includes the Closing Date, if such an election is not
currently effective with respect to the Company. In the case of each Seller
Return, prior to filing such Tax Return, the Member Representative shall
submit each such Tax Return to Parent at least twenty-five (25) days prior to
the due date (including any valid extensions thereof) of such Tax Return for
Parents review and comment. Prior to the filing of each Seller Return, the
Member Representative shall make all revisions requested by Parent to be made
thereto to the extent such comments are requested by Parent at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the relevant due date and are reasonably necessary to
comply with applicable Law and this _Section 5.10_. The preparation and
filing of any Tax Return of the Company that is not a Seller Return shall be
exclusively within the control of Parent.

 



46 (d) _Tax Contests_. Parent agrees to give written notice to the
Member Representative of the receipt of any written notice by the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parents controlled Affiliates
which involves the assertion of any Tax-related claim, or the commencement of
any Tax-related action, in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "); provided, that the
failure to give such written notice shall not, however, relieve any Company
Securityholder (or any other indemnifying party) of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that such Company Securityholder
(or such other indemnifying party) forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. The Member Representative shall have the right (at its sole
expense) to represent the interests of the Company in connection with a Tax
Claim that relates solely to a tax year that ends on or before the Closing
Date and to employ counsel of its choice at its sole expense in respect of
the defense of such Tax Claim; provided that, prior to the Member
Representative assuming control of, and representation of the Companys
interest in respect of, such Tax Claim, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
the applicable notice of the Tax Claim, the Member Representative, on behalf
of Company Securityholders, shall first provide to Parent a written statement
(the " _Tax Claim Notice_ ") verifying and affirming that the Member
Representative shall assume the defense of the Tax Claim and be fully
responsible for all Losses arising out of such Tax Claim but only to the
extent provided in _Article VIII_ ; provided, further, with respect to any Tax
Claim it controls, the Member Representative shall inform Parent of the
status of any such Proceeding and permit Parent to participate in such
Proceeding as reasonably requested, shall provide Parent with copies of any
pleadings, correspondence, and other documents as Parent may reasonably
request and shall consult with Parent prior to the settlement of any such
Proceedings and shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to the
settlement of any such Tax Claim and/or related Proceedings, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall
control the contest and resolution of any Tax Claim for which the Member
Representative does not have the right to control pursuant to the foregoing
provisions or for which the Member Representative has not timely provided the
Tax Claim Notice; provided, however, that Parent shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Member Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into
any settlement of such a Tax Claim controlled by Parent but only to the
extent such settlement would be reasonably likely to increase any Tax
liabilities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Member Representative, on
behalf of the Company Securityholders, shall be entitled to passively
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of their choice
for such purpose, and the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
borne solely by the Member Representative. 

(e) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Member
Representative shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i)
cooperate in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period;
(ii) cooperate in any audit or other Proceedings with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary (whether or not a Tax Claim) for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (iii) make available any
information, records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period; (iv) make available any information required to

 



47  allow Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or the Member
Representative to comply with any information reporting or withholding
requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws; and (v) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax.

 

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The Company Securityholders shall be entitled to all
refunds (including any refund realized as a reduction in or credit against
Tax), if any, of Taxes relating to a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date or the portion of a Straddle Period through the Closing Date
(whether or not any such Tax is paid before Closing) and if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates receives or otherwise
realizes such a refund, it will deliver same to the Member Representative
within ten (10) days after its receipt or realization thereof.

 

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one-half by the Company
Securityholders and one-half by Parent when due, and the Company
Securityholders and Parent will share equally in the expenses incurred
in connection with filing all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges. Parent shall file such Tax
Returns and, if required by applicable Law, the Member Representative will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(h) _Payment_. If the Company Securityholders are obligated to pay, or
indemnify for, any Tax of the Company or any Subsidiary under this _Section
5.10_ , the amount of such Tax shall be paid to Parent (or its designee) no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date such Tax is due to the
applicable Governmental Entity.

(i) _Tax Characterization; Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties
agree to report the Merger pursuant to this Agreement for federal income Tax
purposes as a sale by the Company and an acquisition by Newco of the assets of
the Company in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the assumption of the
liabilities of the Company as determined for federal income Tax purposes,
followed immediately by the complete liquidation of the Company. The parties
agree that allocation of the purchase price for federal income Tax purposes
among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder shall be as set forth on _Schedule
5.10(i)_. The parties will file all applicable Tax returns (including but not
limited to IRS Form 8594) consistent with such allocation and the Tax
treatment described above and shall take no position inconsistent with that
treatment absent a final determination as defined in Code Section 1313(a) that
such treatment is not permitted; _provided however_ , that in the event that
Deloitte fails to provide to Parent all of the supporting documentation for
the Companys determination of its adjusted tax basis in the assets to be
included in Class V and Class VI as reflected in Schedule 5.10(i) by December
31, 2016, Parent and the Surviving Corporation may allocate the purchase price
for federal income Tax purposes among the assets of the Company in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder as
they reasonably determine appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company Securityholders shall be responsible
for the payment of, and shall be entitled to deduct (and Parent and Newco
covenant and agree not to deduct), (i) Seller Expenses and (ii) the Bonus
Amount.

 



48 (j) _Conventions for Filing Tax Returns; Treatment of
Indemnification Payments_. For purposes of preparing Tax Returns, the Member
Representative, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that (i) to the
extent permissible under applicable Laws, the parties shall elect to have each
Tax period of the Company and any Subsidiary end on the Closing Date, and
(ii) unless otherwise required under applicable Law, all indemnification
payments under this Agreement shall be reported as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration for all relevant Tax purposes. Except in connection with the
resolution of a Tax Claim pursuant to _Section 5.10(d)_ , Parent and Newco and
their Affiliates shall not file or amend or otherwise modify any Tax return
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or extend or waive, or cause to be
extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period for the
assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Except as Parent shall reasonably determine necessary to comply
with applicable Law, or to make the Subsidiaries accounting methods and
practices consistent with those of Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that they will not make or change
any Tax election or Tax accounting method or practice with respect to, or
that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or make any
voluntary contact or voluntary disclosure (or any other communication
reasonably expected to have a similar effect) with any Tax authority
regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.11 _Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Governmental
Authorizations_.

(a) Each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Governmental Authorizations and other consents or
approvals of parties to contracts with the Company, its Subsidiaries or Parent
as are necessary for the transactions contemplated herein. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take all such action.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the
parties shall promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to the
knowledge of such party, threatened action or Proceeding by any Governmental

the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise limit the right of Parent to own or operate all or any
portion of the business or assets of the Company.

(c) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the parties shall comply promptly with the notification and reporting
requirements of the HSR Act and the requirements of any other similar

competition, antitrust or similar Laws of any other Governmental Entity,
including by promptly complying with any additional requests for information,
including requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, by any competition or antitrust authority.

(d) Notwithstanding but without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ , as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within ten (10) calendar days) following the date of this Agreement, Parent,
Newco and the Company will, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates
to, make all filings required by Law to be made by them to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all filings under the HSR Act and
similar applicable competition, antitrust or similar Laws in any relevant
foreign country or jurisdiction and all filings, notices and applications).

(e) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall provide the other party and its advisors or, if
required or advisable under applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, only to such other partys outside counsel on an "attorneys-eyes
only" basis, with a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written

practicable with copies of notice or other communications received by Parent

from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger

and Parent shall, if practicable, and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party prior written notice of any meeting
of any of its officers, employees or any other representatives or agents with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

that if a request for additional information is received from the Federal
Trade Commission or the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act, then
such date shall be extended to the 30th day following certification by Parent

not later than that date which is 270 calendar days after the date hereof;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the

or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or prior to such date;

 

(c) by either Parent or Newco, in the event that the conditions to its
obligations set forth in  _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ hereof have not been
satisfied or waived at or prior to the Termination Date; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger under this
paragraph shall not be available to either Parent or Newco if the failure by

material cause of, or resulted in, the failure of such conditions to be
satisfied;

 

(d) by the Company, in the event that the conditions to its obligations set
forth in _Section 6.1_  or _Section 6.2_ hereof have not been satisfied or

53 ARTICLE VIII

 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations_. Subject to the limitations and
other provisions of this Agreement, the representations and warranties
contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect until the first anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ ,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the representations and
warranties set forth in the Fundamental Representations, which shall survive
the Closing for a period of six years. All covenants and agreements of the
parties contained herein shall survive the Closing indefinitely, unless a
shorter time period is explicitly specified therein. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any breach of a
representation or warranty by a party hereto that constitutes fraud, such
representation or warranty shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good
faith, in writing, and with reasonable specificity in light of the facts known
by the non-breaching party at the time of delivery, by notice from the non-
breaching party to the breaching party prior to the expiration date of the
applicable survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of
the relevant representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until
finally resolved.

Section 8.2 _General Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , the
Company Securityholders shall, severally in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Escrow Shares and not jointly, indemnify and defend each of Parent,
Newco, the Surviving Corporation and/or its officers, directors, employees,
Affiliates and/or agents (each a " _Parent Indemnitee_ " and together the "
_Parent Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all damages,
losses, liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (" _Losses_ ") incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, the Parent Indemnitees based upon, arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company contained (A) in _Article III_
of this Agreement or (B) in any certificate delivered to Parent and Newco
pursuant to _Section 6.2,_ (ii) any breach by the Company of its covenants or
agreements contained herein which are to be performed by the Company on or
before the Closing Date, or (iii) a breach of any covenant contained in
_Section 5.10_.

 

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company Securityholders as of
the date of this Agreement and their respective officers, directors,
employees, Affiliates and/or agents (each a " _Member Indemnitee_ ") from any
Loss suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as a result of, in connection
with, or arising out of (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made
by Parent or Newco contained (A) in _Article IV_ of this Agreement to be true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement or (B) in any certificate
delivered to the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , (ii) any breach by Parent
or Newco of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, and (iii)
any breach by the Surviving Corporation (including by way of being the
successor of Newco and the Company) of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein which are to be performed by the Surviving 

 



54  Corporation after the Closing Date. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no
event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be liable under clause (i)
above for an amount in excess of the Indemnification Cap, other than a claim
for a breach of a Fundamental Representation, a claim for failure to pay the
full Merger Consideration or a claim for rescission of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ and pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_  shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby for the period set forth in _Section 8.1_
, except for claims for indemnification pursuant to such clauses asserted
prior to the end of such period which claims shall survive until final
resolution thereof.

(d) As used herein, the term " _Indemnification Claim_ " means a claim
for indemnification by Parent or any other Parent Indemnitee or any Member
Indemnitee, as the case may be, for any Loss under this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_
(such Person making an Indemnification Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ ").
An Indemnitee may give notice of an Indemnification Claim under this
Agreement, whether for its own Loss or for Losses incurred by any other Parent
Indemnitee or Member Indemnitee, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of
such Indemnification Claim executed by an officer of Parent or the Member
Representative, as applicable (a " _Notice of Claim"_ ), and delivered to the
Member Representative or Parent, as applicable (such receiving party, the "
_Indemnitor_ "), promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the
existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ , but in any event before the Escrow Release Date, arising
out of or resulting from:

 

(i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Sections_ _ _ _8.2(a)_ or
_8.2(b)_ ; or

(ii) the assertion in writing, against any Indemnitee of a Proceeding brought
by a third party against any Indemnitee that results from any item
indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Sections_ _ _ _8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_.

 

(e) So long as such Notice of Claim is given in accordance within the time
specified in Section 8.2(d) above, no delay on the part of an Indemnitee in
giving the Indemnitor a Notice of Claim shall limit or reduce the Indemnitees
right to indemnity hereunder, nor relieve the Indemnitor from any of its
obligations under this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ , unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Indemnitor is (or the Company Securityholders are, in the
case of a Notice of Claim on behalf of an Parent Indemnitee) prejudiced
thereby.

 

Section 8.3 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If a Proceeding by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made
against any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_
hereof (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article VIII_ , such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party obligated to indemnify such
Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Parent Indemnitee seeking
indemnification, such Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify Member
Representative) (such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ") of such
claims; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Responsible

 



55  Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The
Responsible Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to assume
the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party at the expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement
or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it
in connection therewith; _provided_ that (i) the Responsible Party shall
permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense
through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party and (ii) the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Responsible Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee if and only
to the extent that representation of the Responsible Party and the Indemnitee
by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of such counsel,
constitute a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional
conduct. So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such
claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such
claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such claim, provided that in such event it shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party or from the
Escrow Account, as the case may be, for such claim unless the Responsible
Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If the Responsible
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days after the receipt
of the Indemnified Partys notice of a Third Party Claim hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to contest, settle or compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The
Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party,
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all
Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

 

(b) All of the parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Parent Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section
8.2(a)_ , other than with respect to fraud, are subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a) the amount of any claim for indemnification by any Parent Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be reduced to reflect any insurance
proceeds recoverable by and paid to any Parent Indemnitee (other than the
proceeds paid under the RandW Policy) and by any tax benefits actually realized
by any Parent Indemnitee with respect to the matter giving rise to such claim
(net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for collection in the case of
insurance proceeds); provided that in no event shall any indemnification
payment be delayed in anticipation of the receipt of any such insurance
proceeds or tax benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation, following the Effective Time) to, in
good faith, diligently seek recovery, at its or their own expense, of all
insurance proceeds from insurers with respect to all Losses with respect to
which any Parent Indemnitee makes a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ (other than claims under the RandW Policy); provided that nothing
in this sentence shall require Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving

 



56  Corporation, following the Effective Time) to seek recovery of insurance
proceeds prior to pursuing indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_
(other than insurance proceeds from the RandW Policy as provided in _Section
8.5_ below). To the extent that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and the Companys Subsidiaries, following the Effective
Time) receives any amount under insurance coverage or realizes any tax
benefit with respect to a matter for which it has previously received payment
in indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , Parent shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the receipt of such insurance proceeds or
realization of such tax benefit, pay and reimburse to the Escrow Agent (if
such reimbursement is to be delivered prior to the Escrow Release Date) or to
the Member Representative (if such reimbursement is to be delivered after the
Escrow Release Date), for any prior indemnification payment (up to the amount
of such insurance proceeds or tax benefit, less any retroactive premium
adjustments directly attributable thereto, and net of out-of-pocket expenses
for collection).

 

(b) notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach and the amount of any Losses that
are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the term "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
phrase which has the effect of making such representation and warranty less
restrictive (as if any such word or phrase were deleted from such
representation and warranty), other than (i) the use of the word "Material"
in the definitions of Material Contract, Material Lease, Material Customers
and Material Suppliers, (ii) the failure list items on the Disclosure
Schedules because of materiality qualifications to the disclosure, and (iii)
the use the word "material" in _Section 3.5_ with respect to Financial
Statements and in _Section 10.2_ ;

 

(c) in no event shall Loss include any consequential, indirect, lost profits,
punitive and exemplary damages (other than to the extent consequential,
indirect, punitive or exemplary damages are paid in a Third Party Claim);

(d) in no event shall (i) the Company Securityholders be required to provide
indemnification to any of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ : (A) if the Losses
associated with such claim (or group of related claims arising out of the
same or similar circumstances) are less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
(the " _De Minimis Claim Amount_ "); or (B) unless and until the Losses
associated with all claims for indemnification made pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ incurred by the Parent Indemnitees aggregate at least One Million
Five Hundred Fifty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,552,500) (the "
_Deductible_ "), after which point the Company Securityholders shall only be
required to provide indemnification with respect to indemnifiable Losses with
respect to any such claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ in excess of the Deductible (for the avoidance of doubt, Losses
associated with any claim for which indemnification is unavailable hereunder
solely by reason of the limitation described in foregoing clause (i)(A) will
not be counted towards determining if the Deductible has been reached);
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the De Minimis Claim Amount and the Deductible shall not apply to any
indemnification claims made with respect to the Fundamental Representations,
indemnification claims made pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(ii) or (iii)_ , or
any claim based on fraud; (ii) the Company Securityholders be required to
provide indemnification to the Parent Indemnitees for indemnifiable Losses
arising 

 



57  from claims for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ in an
aggregate amount in excess of the Escrow Funds except with respect to claims
made with respect to the Fundamental Representations or any claim based on
fraud; and (iii) any Company Securityholder be required to provide
indemnification to the Parent Indemnitees for indemnifiable Losses with
respect to _Section 8.2(a)_ in an aggregate amount in excess of the Merger
Consideration actually received by the Company Securityholder;

(e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
the Member Representatives and Company Securityholders shall not be entitled
to seek indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ with respect to
breaches of representations and warranties, other than a claim for breach of
Fundamental Representations, or a claim for failure to pay the full Merger
Consideration or a claim for rescission of the transactions contemplated
hereby, until the amount of all Losses exceeds the Deductible, in which case
the Member Representative and the Company Securityholders shall be entitled to
seek indemnification only for the amount of such excess, up to the
Indemnification Cap and subject to any other applicable limits on
indemnification; and

 

(f) in the event that any facts or circumstances arise resulting in any
Losses, each of the Parent Indemnitees and the Member Indemnitees shall have
a duty and an obligation to take commercially reasonable and timely actions to
mitigate the amount of all such Losses. Each of Parent and the Company
Securityholders shall take such actions or cause such actions to be taken as
are or may become necessary so as to mitigate, to the extent required by the
preceding sentence, all Losses for which they may seek indemnification
hereunder.

 

Section 8.5 _Source of Recovery_. Any valid indemnification claims brought by
any of the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ and payable by the
Company Securityholders shall be paid: (i) first, from the Escrow Funds (to
the extent of the Escrow Amount, if any, then remaining in the Escrow
Account), in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and Parent and the Member
Representative shall promptly cause such payment to be delivered to Parent
under the terms of the Escrow Agreement; (ii) second, if such payment is not
satisfied by the preceding clause (i), by recovery from the RandW Policy and
(iii) third, in the event the Escrow Fund is exhausted and the ability to
recover under the RandW Policy is exhausted or not available, subject in each
case to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, then severally and not
jointly in accordance with each Company Securityholders respective Merger
Consideration Percentage, by recovery from each such Company Securityholder;
_provided_ _that_ , with respect to any indemnification payable by a Company
Securityholder to a Parent Indemnitee as a result of any breach by a Company
Securityholder of the representations, warranties or covenants in such Company
Securityholders Letter of Transmittal, solely the Company Securityholder
responsible for creating such indemnification obligation shall be responsible
therefor, and the Parent Indemnitee(s) will be entitled to recover solely from
such Company Securityholder after first seeking recovery from such Company
Securityholders Pro Rata Escrow Share and subject to the other limitations
set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, Parent (for itself and
on behalf of the Parent Indemnitees) acknowledges and agrees that it must
first make claims for payment for any such liability, to the extent covered
under the RandW Policy, against the RandW Policy. Furthermore, Parent (for itself
and on behalf of the Parent Indemnitees) acknowledges and agrees that in the
event a claim under the RandW Policy is denied and Parent or Parents
Indemnitees actions (or inaction) (in the case of the Surviving Corporation,
only such actions

 



58  after Effective Time) is the sole cause of such denial, then the Parent
Indemnities shall not be entitled to indemnity by the Company Securityholders
to the extent prejudiced thereby. Finally, any amount paid by the insurer
under the RandW Policy shall be deemed to have been paid to Parent or the Parent
Indemnitees, as applicable, (regardless of which loss payee is actually paid
under the RandW Policy) and such deemed payment shall be taken into account
when determining the Company Securityholders liability hereunder.

With respect to clause (ii) in the preceding paragraph, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue collection of such claim
under the RandW Policy. Parents obligation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover Losses under the RandW Policy shall not include any
obligation to litigate such claims with the applicable insurer if the insurer
has denied coverage in writing, except to the extent that the Indemnitor
elects, in its discretion, to pay all of the expenses of such litigation. No
Parent Indemnitee may assert or pursue any claims for Losses against any
Company Securityholder if, and to the extent, such Parent Indemnitee has been
compensated for such Losses under the terms of the RandW Policy. In the
event that a Parent Indemnitee is compensated for a Loss under the terms of
the RandW Policy after payment for such Loss has already been made by Company
Securityholders to such Parent Indemnitee, then such Parent Indemnitee shall
pay to such Company Securityholders an amount equal to the amount that would
have been applied under clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph. Nothing set
forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall be deemed to expand or limit the scope of
any of Company Securityholders obligations to any Parent Indemnitee with
respect to the amount of Losses payable by the Company Securityholders.

 

Section 8.6 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnitor or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnitor
shall satisfy its obligations within five (5) Business Days of such final,
non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
All payments to be made by the Company Securityholders as Indemnitors shall
be made to Parent for the benefit of the Parent Indemnitees.

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in _Section 10.12_ , in
any Letter of Transmittal and in the case of fraud relating to entry into this
Agreement, after the Closing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ shall be the exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for
any misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

Section 8.9 _Member Representative_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Member Representative is a party to this Agreement solely in its
role of representative of the Company Securityholders according to the terms
of _Article IX_ hereof. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Member Representative shall have no liability to, and shall not be
liable for any Losses of, to any party hereto or to any Parent Indemnitee in
connection with any obligations of the Member Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated

 



59  hereby, except to the extent such Losses shall be proven to be the direct
result of willful misconduct by the Member Representative in connection with
the performance of its obligations hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement.

Member Representative, in its capacity as a member in the Company) and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Member Representative
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and each other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate referred to herein or therein or the transactions provided for
herein or therein (including in connection with any and all claims for
indemnification brought under _Article VIII_ hereof), and to take any and all
actions which the Member Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf of the
Company Securityholders, including asserting or pursuing any Proceeding (a "
_Claim_ ") against Parent, Newco and/or the Surviving Corporation, defending
any Third Party Claims or Claims by the Parent Indemnitees, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective representatives
regarding such Claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A) institute any
Proceeding; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Proceeding
initiated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person against the
Member Representative and/or any of the Company Securityholders, the Escrow
Funds, and receive process on behalf of any or all Company Securityholders in
any such Proceeding and compromise or settle on such terms as the Member
Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases
and discharges with respect to, any such Proceeding; (C) file any proofs of
debt, claims and petitions as the Member Representative may deem advisable or
necessary;

 



60  (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under the Escrow Agreement; and
(E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered
in any such Proceeding, it being understood that the Member Representative
shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any
liability for any failure to take any such actions;

 

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Company Securityholders or any
of them and/or the Member Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_
, however, that no such failure to act on the part of the Member
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Member Representative or by the Company Securityholders unless such waiver
is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Member Representative;
and

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Member
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all
other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or
executed in connection herewith and therewith.

All of the aforementioned actions shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside the Merger Agreement and shall be binding on the Company
Securityholders as a matter of contract law.

 

(b) The Member Representative shall be entitled to the payment of all its
expenses incurred as the Member Representative. In connection with the
foregoing, at the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall transfer $250,000
(the " _Expense Funds_ ") to the Member Representative, to be used by Member
Representative to pay expenses incurred by Member Representative in its
capacity as Member Representative. The Company Securityholders will not
receive interest or other earnings on the Expense Funds and the Company
Securityholders irrevocably transfer and assign to the Member Representative
any ownership right that they may have in any interest that may accrue on
funds held in the Expense Fund. The Company Securityholders acknowledge that
the Member Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Member Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Funds
other than as a result of its willful misconduct. For Tax purposes, the
Expense Funds shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Company Securityholders at the time of Closing. Once the Member
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that the Member
Representative will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as the
Member Representative, then the Member Representative will appropriately
distribute the remaining unused Expense Funds, if any, to the Company
Securityholders (either directly or through a third party paying agent). In
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any

 



61  instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the
Member Representative hereunder (i) the Member Representative shall incur no
responsibility whatsoever to any Company Securityholders by reason of any
error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or
in connection with the Escrow Agreement or any such other agreement,
instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure
to act which represents willful misconduct, and (ii) the Member Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants
or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any
error in judgment or other act or omission of the Member Representative
pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Member Representative to
liability to any Company Securityholders. Each Company Securityholder shall
indemnify, pro rata based upon such holders Pro Rata Escrow Share, the Member
Representative against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other
experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever) ("
_Representative Losses_ "), arising out of or in connection with any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by the Member Representative pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including any challenge or
Proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Member Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise), in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred
or suffered. In the event of any Proceeding which finally adjudicates that any
Representative Loss was primarily caused by the willful misconduct of the
Member Representative, the Member Representative will reimburse the Company
Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
attributable to such willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification
hereunder, upon written notice from the Member Representative to the Company
Securityholders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any
such indemnification amount, each Company Securityholder shall promptly
deliver to the Member Representative full payment of his or her Pro Rata
Escrow Share of the amount of such deficiency. If not paid directly to the
Member Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such Representative
Loss may be recovered by the Member Representative from (i) the funds in the
Expense Funds and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Account otherwise
distributable to the Company Securityholders pursuant to the terms hereof and
the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written
instructions delivered by the Member Representative to the Escrow Agent;
provided that while this section allows the Member Representative to be paid
from the Expense Funds and the Escrow Funds, this does not relieve the Company
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Member
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Member
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

(d) If the Member Representative shall have resigned, died or is otherwise
become incapacitated or removed, Company Securityholders who in the aggregate
hold at least a majority of the interest in the Escrow Account shall appoint,
subject to the prior approval of the Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld), a successor member representative not later than 30
days following the resignation, death, incapacity or removal of the Member
Representative.

 



62 (e) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Member Representative
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the Company Securityholders.

 

(f) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any holder of Company Units; and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger.

Section 10.2 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and schedules hereto, or
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, any matter that is clearly
disclosed in a Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
included in such other Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of an
appropriate cross reference thereto. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule shall not necessarily mean that such fact or item is material to the
Company or its Subsidiaries individually or taken as a whole.

Section 10.3 _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the
essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day
for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall
fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or any date on which banks in New York City are
authorized to be closed, the party having such privilege or duty may exercise
such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a
regular Business Day.

 



64 Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for
in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each
party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein. Parent and Newco understand and
acknowledge that all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or to be
incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Seller Expenses), will be paid by the Company in cash
at or prior to the Closing.

Section 10.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to the choice of law or conflicts of law principles thereof.

 

Section 10.6 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives. This Agreement shall be for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, the Parent Indemnitees,
the Member Indemnitees and the Company Securityholders and their respective
heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives, and is not
intended, nor shall be construed, to give any other Person any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a mutually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.8 _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of
contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in
any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or

attached thereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and
supersedes all previous written, oral or implied understandings among them
with respect to such matters.

 

Section 10.10 _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it

of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced
to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.11 _No Strict Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties
hereto, and shall not be strictly construed against either party.

 



65 Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Company and Parent and
Newco acknowledge that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the
non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the
parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity,
to enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only
by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto waives any
right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on,
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any course of
conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of any
party hereto.

Section 10.14 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
parties exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 

Section 10.15 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, by action taken by the respective boards of directors
or managers of the Company, Parent and Newco. This Agreement (including the
provisions of this Section 10.15) may not be amended or modified except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties required
pursuant to the preceding sentence.
