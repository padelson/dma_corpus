Board Member and the Board of Directors, (i) prevents the Venturer Board
Member from being able to perform the services required of a member of the
Board of Directors, (ii) has continued for a period of at least 180 days

operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Each of the Venturers is duly qualified and in good standing to do
business as a foreign limited liability company or corporation, as
applicable, in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its properties
makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the

(b) As of the Closing, NewLP will (i) be a limited partnership duly organized
or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, (ii) have full power and authority to own, lease or
otherwise hold and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its

NewLP.   (c) Each of U.S. Propane and the GP is a limited partnership or

the GP and the authorized and outstanding Partner Interests of U.S. Propane
are as disclosed on Schedule 4.2(a). All outstanding Securities have been
validly issued and are fully paid (to the extent required under the Amended

purchaser of the Securities would be responsible.   (b) Except as

Securities (whether issued or granted by, or binding upon any of the GP, U.S.
Propane, NewLP or any Venturer).   (d) There are no outstanding registration
rights with respect to any Securities.   (e) Except as contemplated by

to the date hereof (a "Pre-signing Event") or (ii) after the date hereof but
prior to the Closing (a "Post-Signing Event"), in any case, requiring
supplementation or amendment of the schedules provided by the Venturers in
the Disclosure Schedules of the Venturers, supplement or amend such schedules
to this Agreement to reflect any fact, matter, circumstance or event, which,
if existing, occurring or known on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such schedules which were or
have been rendered inaccurate thereby. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, any such supplements or amendments must be made prior to
such date on which the last of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied or waived by the party or parties
entitled to waive the same, it being the intention of the parties that such

amendment to the schedules shall (i) amend or supplement the representations
and warranties (and corresponding schedules) made as of the date hereof or
(ii) have any effect for the purpose of determining (A) satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof or (B) compliance by the GP, U.S.
Propane and the Venturers with their respective covenants and agreements set

Disclosure Schedules as so supplemented or amended as of the Closing with
respect to Pre-Signing Events and Post-Signing Events shall be deemed to be
the Disclosure Schedules for purposes of determining whether or not any
breach of the representations and warranties of any of the Venturers has
occurred.   7.7 TAX REPORTING. The parties intend that this Agreement effect
a sale by U.S. Propane of the Retained Assets, including a general partner
interest in Heritage MLP and a general partner interest in Heritage OLP. The
parties have agreed to the transactions contemplated hereby in order to
achieve the economic and Tax consequences of such sales. In furtherance
thereof, the parties agree to report for federal income tax purposes the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
that is consistent with the form (and   33    order) of the transactions
described in Article 3, and in particular agree to report the federal income
tax consequences of such transactions as follows:   (a) Each of US Propane
and the GP is a partnership immediately prior to the transaction for which
provision is made in Section 3.2.   (b) After the transfer of all of the
equity in the GP to NewGP and the transfer of all of the equity of U.S.
Propane to NewLP as provided in Section 3.2, NewGP will be the continuation
of the GP (that is, the same partnership for federal income tax purposes as)
and NewLP will be the continuation of (that is, the same partnership for
federal income tax purposes as) U.S. Propane, and the GP and U.S. Propane are
disregarded from and after such transfer until (at least) all of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement have occurred.   (c) The
transfer of certain assets from U.S. Propane to NewLP and the assumption by
NewLP of certain liabilities of U.S. Propane, as provided in Section 3.3, are
each disregarded.   (d) The purchase by Acquirer, as provided in Section
3.4, of the Securities is treated as the purchase of the Assets and
Properties of U.S. Propane. The parties agree that the fair market value of
each of the then Assets and Properties of U.S. Propane is as set out in
Schedule 7.7. Each of the parties shall use such fair market values for all
tax reporting purposes. Further, the Parties agree that in determining the
taxable income of each of the Parties attributable to their ownership of
interests in the Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP for the taxable year of the
Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP including the Closing Date, Acquirer shall
cause Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP to close their books as of the Closing
Date and to allocate the taxable income of Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP for
the period prior to the Closing Date allocable to the Retained Assets to
NewLP and the taxable income of Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP allocable to
the Retained Assets for the period beginning with the Closing Date through
the end of the taxable year to Acquirer. To the extent that Heritage MLP or
Heritage OLP is unable to close its books as of the Closing Date, the Parties
agree to cause the tax results to the Parties to equal as nearly as possible
those that would have resulted if the books of Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP
had been closed as provided in the preceding sentence.  In addition, each
party agrees to so report the transactions for all other Tax purposes in a
manner consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7 unless
such party receives a written opinion of counsel or its regular tax adviser
that one or more of such positions is not permitted under then Applicable
Law, in which case such party may then so report the transactions in a manner
that is inconsistent with the foregoing only after providing such written
opinion to the other parties hereto and consultation thereafter with such
other parties. The requirements of the foregoing (taking into account
the effect of the preceding sentence) are referred to herein as the
"Reporting Position." If any Tax authority proposes to characterize the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement as to a party in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Reporting Position, then such party agrees to contest
such proposed characterization in good faith using commercially reasonable
efforts to defend the Reporting Position and further agrees to keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed as to the status of any such controversy.
Likewise, the Parties agree that Heritage OLP and Heritage MLP will allocate
to NewLP taxable income attributable to the amounts paid to NewLP pursuant to
Section 3.3(f).   34     7.8 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Venturers shall cause NewLP to pay
the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the GP, U.S. Propane, NewLP and the
Venturers, on the one hand, and the Acquirer shall pay its out-of-pocket fees
and expenses, on the other hand, incurred in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, all such out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the GP or
U.S. Propane for time periods after the Closing shall be paid by the GP, U.S.
Propane or the Acquirer.   7.9 ACTIONS BY PARTIES. Each party hereto agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article 8 and to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to refrain from taking any action within its control that would cause a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall take all commercially reasonable steps
necessary or desirable, and proceed diligently and in good faith and shall
use all reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable, consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Operative Documents.

60 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") affecting any employee of U.S. Propane
or GP without fully complying with the notice and other applicable
requirements of WARN.   7.11 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. The Acquirer will
enforce the capital commitments of the members of the Acquirer to make
capital contributions to the Acquirer, and will not permit the waiver,
amendment or termination of (i) any of such capital commitments, or (ii) any
provision of the limited liability agreement of the Acquirer that provides
that the Venturers are third party beneficiaries of the obligations of the
members to make such capital commitments.   7.12 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TAX
SHELTER REGULATIONS. Except as reasonably necessary to comply with applicable
securities laws and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (including the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 7.3
and Section 7.4) or in any other agreement to which a party hereto is bound,
the parties hereto (and each employee, representative, or other agent of any
of the parties) are expressly authorized to disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income "tax treatment" and
"tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg.
Sections 1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9), respectively) of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such parties relating to
such "tax treatment" and "tax structure" of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For these purposes, "tax structure" is limited to facts
relevant to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction
described herein.   7.13 TRADEMARKS, LOGOS, ETC. The Heritage Entities shall

IX  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may
be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned by written
notice at any time prior to the Closing in any of the following manners:  
(a) concurrently with any permitted termination of the
Contribution Agreement; provided, however, that if the Contribution Agreement
is terminated due to a breach or default (i) by La Grange (as such term is
defined in the Contribution Agreement) of its obligations thereunder or a
failure by La Grange to satisfy its conditions to closing thereunder, this
Agreement shall not be terminated automatically but may be terminated by
election of the Venturers furnished in writing to the other parties hereto,
or (ii) by Heritage MLP or Heritage OLP of their respective obligations
thereunder or a failure by Heritage MLP or Heritage OLP to satisfy their
conditions to closing thereunder, this Agreement shall not be terminated
automatically but may be terminated by election of the Acquirer furnished in
writing to the other parties hereto;   (b) by written consent of each of the
parties to this Agreement;   39     (c) by any party if the Closing has
not occurred on or before February 15, 2004, unless such failure to close
resulted from a breach of this Agreement by the party or its Affiliate
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c);   (d)
by any party if (i) there is any statute, rule or regulation that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
otherwise prohibited or (ii) a Governmental Authority (A) has issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable or (B) has made any order, decree, ruling or other
action consenting to or approving consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby contingent or conditional in any manner that has a
Material Adverse Effect, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have become final and nonappealable;   (e) by any party, if there has been
any violation or breach by any other party (other than an Affiliate or
related party of the first party) of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement that has rendered impossible the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of such other party set
forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 and such violation or breach has neither
been cured within 30 days after notice by such first party to the other party
nor waived by the first party;   (f) by any party, if any other event shall
occur that shall render the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations
of any other party (other than an Affiliate or related party of the first
party) impossible and such condition has not been waived by the other
parties; or   (g) by the Acquirer, if any amendment is made to any schedule
in accordance with Section 7.6 that in the Acquirer\'s reasonable judgment
(i) with respect to any Pre-Signing Event, is material or (ii) with respect
to any Post-Signing Event, the effect of the event or circumstance to which
such amendment relates materially impairs the financial condition,
business, properties, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the GP
or U.S. Propane.   9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 by any party, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other parties specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made. If this Agreement is terminated
for any reason, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, except
that (a) the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 and in Section 7.8
shall survive the termination hereof, (b) nothing contained in this Section
9.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement and (c) nothing shall relieve any party from any liability for a
breach of its obligations hereunder existing at the time of such termination.
If this Agreement is terminated (y) because the Acquirer is unable to arrange
the funding necessary to consummate the Closing, the Acquirer agrees to pay
$500,000 to the Venturers or (z) by the Acquirer pursuant to Section 9.1(g)
because of an amendment to any schedule with respect to a Pre-Signing Event,
the Venturers agree to pay $500,000 to the Acquirer. The parties stipulate
and agree that (a) the $500,000 amount referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall constitute liquidated damages payable in lieu of any
other costs or expenses incurred by a party upon such termination, shall
constitute the sole remedy upon a termination in accordance with clause (y)
or (z) of the preceding sentence and (b) they each believe that such
amounts constitute a fair and   40    reasonable resolution if this
Agreement is terminated under the circumstances referred to in such clauses
(y) or (z).   9.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.   9.4 WAIVER. Any
party may, on behalf of itself only and not on behalf of any other party, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party (other than an Affiliate or related party of the first party) contained
herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto,
(b) waive compliance by any other party (other than an Affiliate or related
party of the first party) with any of its agreements contained herein and (c)
waive fulfillment of any conditions to its obligations contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such party.
No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.   ARTICLE X 
INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS   10.1 INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS OF NEWLP AND THE VENTURERS. NewLP and, if NewLP is unable to
satisfy its obligations hereunder and, with respect to each Venturer, only to
the extent that a Venturer has received after the Closing from NewLP any
distribution of cash or property, each such Venturer shall, except for
indemnification in respect of the clause (b) below with respect to the last
sentence of Section 4.6, which indemnification shall only be several as among
NewLP and each of the Venturers, indemnify the Acquirer Indemnified Parties,
as the case may be, and hold the Acquirer Indemnified Parties harmless from,
against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of, based upon or
resulting from:   (a) the breach of any representation or warranty of any
Venturer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (other than those in
Section 4.2, Section 4.3, the last sentence of Section 4.6 or in Section
4.24);   (b) the breach of any representation or warranty of any
Venturer contained in or made pursuant to Section 4.2, Section 4.3, the last
sentence of Section 4.6 or in Section 4.24;   (c) the breach by any
Venturer or the failure of any of the Venturers to observe or perform in any
material respect, any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or any other Operative Document; and   (d) the Assumed
Liabilities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, NewLP and the Venturers will
not have any obligation to indemnify the Acquirer Indemnified Parties for
Losses under Section 10.1(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
such Losses under Section 10.1(a) exceeds $300,000 (regardless of whether, in
the case of third party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of
the foregoing, the Venturers may have a meritorious defense), at and after
which time NewLP and   41    the Venturers shall be liable for all
Losses in excess of $300,000 and which do not in the aggregate exceed
$3,000,000. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, none of the
Venturers shall be required pursuant to this Section 10.1 to make any payment
to any of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties for Losses unless such Acquirer
Indemnified Party has first sought to collect payment of such Losses from
NewLP and NewLP has failed or refused to make payment thereof to the extent
required under this Article 10, after which such Acquirer Indemnified Party
may, only to the extent specified in this Section 10.1, seek payment of such
Losses from a Venturer (unless the failure or refusal of NewLP to make such
payment is due to a good faith dispute regarding such Acquirer Indemnified
Party\'s right under this Section 10.1 to indemnification for such Losses).
The rights and remedies of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any clause of this Section
10.1 or any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or other
Operative Documents shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act,
omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such claim is
based may also be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement or other Operative Document that would not give
rise to any rights or remedies of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties.   10.2
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACQUIRER. The Acquirer, shall indemnify
the Venturer Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and hold the Venturer
Indemnified Parties harmless from, against and in respect of any and all
Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from:   (a) the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Acquirer contained in or made pursuant to
this Agreement (other than those in the second and third sentences of Section
5.1 and in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4);   (b) the breach of any
representation or warranty of Acquirer contained in or made pursuant to the
second and third sentences of Section 5.1, or in Section 5.3 or Section
5.4;   (c) the breach by the Acquirer or failure of the Acquirer or any of
its Affiliates to observe or perform in any material respect, any of their
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other Operative
Document; and   (d) the Retained Liabilities.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Acquirer will not have any obligation to indemnify the
Venturer Indemnified Parties for Losses under Section 10.2(a) unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under Section 10.2(a) exceeds
$300,000 of the Purchase Price (regardless of whether, in the case of third
party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, the
Acquirer may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time
the Acquirer shall be liable for all Losses in excess of $300,000 and which
do not in the aggregate exceed $3,000,000. The rights and remedies of the
Venturer Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of or otherwise in
respect of any clause of this Section 10.2 or any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement or other Operative Document shall in no way be
limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts upon which any such claim is based may also be the subject matter of
any representation, warranty or covenant in this   42    Agreement or
other Operative Document that would not give rise to any rights or remedies
of the Venturer Indemnified Parties.   10.3 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.  
(a) Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Article 10 (an
"Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action against such
Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Action") in respect of which indemnity
or reimbursement may be sought against a party or parties required to
make indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement of
such Third Party Action, but the failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve it of any liability which it may have to any Acquirer
Indemnified Party under Section 10.1 or any Venturer Indemnified Party under
Section 10.2, as applicable, unless such failure actually and materially
adversely affects the defense of such Third Party Action. In case notice of
commencement of any such Third Party Action shall be given to the
Indemnifying Party as above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense of such action at its
own expense, with counsel chosen by it that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that:   (i) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to  participate in the defense of such Third Party Action
and to employ  counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such
Third  Party Action (provided that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to  reimbursement for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such 
counsel in accordance with subclauses (A) and (B) below in this Section 
10.3(a));   (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written 
approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed, before entering into any settlement  of such Third Party
Action or ceasing to defend against such Third  Party Action, if pursuant to
or as a result of such settlement or  cessation, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed  against the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnified Party would be  adversely affected thereby;   (iii) no
Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of  any judgment or enter into
any settlement that does not include as an  unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to  each Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect of  such Third Party Action; and   (iv) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to  control the defense of any Third
Party Action unless within 15 days  after receipt of such written notice from
the Indemnified Party, the  Indemnifying Party confirms in writing its
responsibility to indemnify  the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Action and  reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the
full amount of  the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any such
Third Party  Action.  Except as set forth in the following sentence, after
written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume control of the defense of any such Third Party Action in
accordance with the foregoing, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the   43    Indemnified Party hereunder for any fees and expenses of
counsel subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party attributable to
defending against such Third Party Action, and (ii) as long as the
Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting such Third Party Action in good
faith, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge the claim underlying, such Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If (A)
the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such Third
Party Action in accordance with this Section 10.3(a), or (B) the Indemnified
Party has been advised in writing by counsel that representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct (in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of
such Third Party Action on behalf of the Indemnified Party), in each case the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Action in
such manner as it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to reimburse the Indemnified Parties for the costs and expenses of
only a single counsel for such Third Party Action and any matters related
thereto and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle or resolve such Third
Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party
therefor in accordance with this Article 10. The reimbursement of fees and
expenses of counsel required by this Article 10 shall be made by periodic
payments during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills
are received or expenses incurred.   (b) If the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to indemnify the indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 10, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
with respect to the claims to which such indemnification relates. If an
Indemnified Party becomes entitled to any indemnification from an
Indemnifying Party, such indemnification shall be made in cash upon demand,
unless the Indemnifying Party is disputing the right of such Indemnified
Party to indemnification hereunder.   (c) The right of indemnification
pursuant to this Article 10 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
each of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective Affiliates,
managers, directors, officers, members, employees and other agents and
representatives, other than with respect to fraud or willful breach by a
Party.   10.4 SURVIVAL. All representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive (and not be affected
in any respect by) the Closing, any investigation conducted by any party and
any information that any party may receive (other than information identified
in the Schedules attached hereto).   44     (a) The right to
indemnification:   (i) with respect to any breach or violation of any of
the  representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than 
those in the last sentence of Section 4.6, or Sections 4.11, 4.18,  4.22,
4.24 and 5.4), shall survive for one (1) year from the Closing  Date;  
(ii) with respect to any breach of violation of any of the  representations
and warranties contained in the last sentence of  Section 4.6 and in Sections
4.24 or 5.4, shall survive indefinitely;   (iii) with respect to any breach
or violation of any of the  representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.11, 4.18 and  4.22, shall survive for the applicable statute of
limitations; and   (iv) with respect to all covenants and agreements 
contained in this Agreement, shall survive for the applicable statute  of
limitations (including all periods of extension thereof, whether  automatic
or permissive).   (b) The expiration of any survival period under this
Agreement will not affect the liability of any Party under this Article 10
for any Losses as to which a bona fide claim has been asserted prior to the
termination of such survival period.   10.5 NO SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES. No party and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages from the other parties
or any Indemnifying Party in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this Article 10 or otherwise, and each party hereby waives any claim or
right to special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages hereunder,
even if caused by the active, passive, sole, joint, concurrent or comparative
negligence, strict liability, or other fault of any party, other than fraud
or intentional misconduct.   10.6 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
Neither NewLP nor any of the Venturers shall have any obligation to indemnify
the Acquirer Indemnified Parties hereunder with respect to any breach of a
representation or warranty of the Venturers resulting from a Pre-
Signing Event or Post-Signing Event to the extent that the Disclosure
Schedules of the Venturers to this Agreement were amended or supplemented in
accordance with Section 7.6 to reflect such Pre-Signing Event or Post-Signing
Event prior to Closing. Following the Closing, the determination of whether
any of the Venturers have breached any of their representations or warranties
shall be determined on the basis of the Disclosure Schedules of the Venturers
as amended or supplemented as of the Closing.   (b) The Acquirer shall not
have any obligation to indemnify the Venturer Indemnified Parties hereunder
with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty of the Acquirer
resulting from a Pre-Signing Event or from a Post-Signing Event to the extent
that the Acquirer submits Disclosure Schedules to the Venturers reflecting
such Pre-Signing Event or Post-Signing Event prior to Closing.   45    
(c) Following the Closing, the determination of whether the Acquirer has
breached any of its representations or warranties shall be determined on
the basis of the Disclosure Letter of the Acquirer as so amended or
supplemented as of the Closing.   ARTICLE XI  MISCELLANEOUS   11.1

the subject matter hereof.   11.3 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFIT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by any party without the
prior written consent of each of the parties, and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void; provided, however, that Acquirer may
assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Acquirer without the prior written consent of any of the other
parties, but no such assignment shall relieve the Acquirer of its obligations
hereunder. Except as provided in Article 10, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
the parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.   11.4 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed
unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect; provided, however, that if any such provision may be made
enforceable by limitation thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be
so limited and shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law.   11.5 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Texas, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Texas.   11.6 JURISDICTION. Any legal action, suit or
proceeding in law or equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may only be instituted in any
state or federal court located in the State of Texas, and each party agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such
action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of such court, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof may
not be enforced in or by such court. Each party further irrevocably submits
to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding.
Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such action, suit
or proceeding shall be effective against any party if given by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) or by any other means which
requires a signed receipt in accordance with, and at the address listed in,
Section 10.1. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of
any party to serve process in any manner permitted by law.   48     11.7

of any party and without further consideration, the other parties shall

U.S. Propane, NewLP or the Venturers to fulfill their respective obligations
under this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and (b) otherwise
consummate more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Operative Documents.   11.8 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The
