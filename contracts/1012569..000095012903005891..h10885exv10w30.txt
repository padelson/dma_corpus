         (d) It is the intention of the parties that immediately following the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by NewLP, neither U.S. Propane nor the GP
will have any liability or responsibility for any Liabilities of U.S. Propane or
the GP other than the Retained Liabilities, and such Assumed Liabilities and
Retained Liabilities will be the subject of the indemnity of NewLP and the
Venturers (with respect to the Assumed Liabilities) and U.S. Propane and
Acquirer (with respect to Retained Liabilities) as and to the extent provided in
Section 10.1 and Section 10.2. It is the further intention of the parties that
the characterization of Liabilities as Assumed Liabilities or Retained
Liabilities, respectively, will not diminish any right of the Venturer
Indemnified Parties to receive indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section
10.2 or any right of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties to receive indemnification
for Losses pursuant to Section 10.1 for a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement pertaining to Assumed Liabilities or Retained

note (the "GP Interests Note"), to be in a form mutually acceptable to the
Acquirer and the Venturers, such dividend to be declared and paid immediately
prior to the Closing. The GP Interests Note shall entitle NewGP and NewLP to
receive aggregate amounts calculated as described below, which amounts shall be
payable at the times specified below:

                  of the 1.0% general partner interest and the Incentive

cause such members to be removed from the Board of Directors, as members of the
Board of Directors of the GP and any other offices that such persons may hold
with the GP

                                       14

<PAGE>

or U.S. Propane, and concurrently with such resignations, the Acquirer will take
such actions as are necessary or appropriate to fill the vacancies created
thereby. In addition, upon the request of Acquirer received not less than three
business days in writing prior to Closing, each of Bill W. Byrne, Stephen L.

(the "Venturer Board Member") who shall have the right to serve as a member of
the Board of Directors of the GP, to receive notice of such meetings and to
receive information provided by the GP to the Board of Directors; provided,
however, that the GP may require as a condition precedent to the Venturers'
rights under this Section 3.6 that the Venturer Board Member shall agree to hold
in trust and confidence all information so received during such meetings;
provided further, that the GP reserves the right not to provide information and
to exclude the Venturer Board Member from any meeting or portion thereof if (i)
delivery of such information or attendance at such meeting by the Venturer Board
Member would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the GP and
its counsel or (ii) the GP determines in its sole discretion that it is
necessary or advisable to discuss matters relating to that certain Promissory
Note of Heritage MLP dated as of the Closing Date and payable to NewLP in the
original principal amount of $50,000,000 (the "MLP Note"). In the event of the
death or Disability of the person serving as the Venturer Board Member, the
Venturers shall have the right to designate a replacement to serve as the
Venturer Board Member, and the person so designated as a replacement shall be
subject to the approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) of not less
than a majority of the entire membership of Board of Directors of the GP

member of the Board of Directors), and if not so approved the Venturers may
propose a different person as such a replacement. The right of the Venturers to
designate the Venturer Board Member shall terminate upon the payment in full of
all amounts due and payable under the MLP Note and the Venturer Board Member
shall resign from the Board of Directors of the GP immediately upon such
payment. The Parties agree that Richard T. O'Brien shall be the initial Venturer
Board Member upon Closing. As used herein, "Disability" shall mean a physical or
mental condition of the Venturer Board Member that, in the good faith judgment
of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors
of the GP (excluding the Venturer Board Member, if the Venturer Board Member is
then a member of the Board of Directors), based upon certification by a licensed
physician reasonably acceptable to the Venturer Board Member and the Board of
Directors, (i) prevents the Venturer Board Member from being able to perform the
services required of a member of the Board of Directors, (ii) has continued for
a period of at least 180 days during any 12-month period and (iii) is expected
to continue.

distribution from U.S. Propane or the GP in violation of Section 17-607(a) of

interests in Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP have been validly issued. None of the

Common Units owned by U.S. Propane or HHI and all issuances and sales by
Heritage OLP of its outstanding general partner interests have been effected in
compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws, including

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         7.1 ACCESS TO INFORMATION.(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing,
the Venturers shall cause the GP, U.S. Propane and NewLP to (i) give the
Acquirer and its authorized representatives reasonable access to all facilities
and all books and records relating to the GP, U.S. Propane and NewLP, (ii)
permit the Acquirer and its authorized representatives to make such inspections
of the Assets and Properties of the GP and U.S. Propane as they may reasonably
require to verify the accuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Article 4 and (iii) shall furnish the Acquirer and their respective authorized
representatives with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the GP, U.S. Propane and NewLP as the Acquirer may from time to
time reasonably request; provided, however, that the Venturers shall have the
right to have a representative present at all times of any such inspections or
examinations conducted at the offices or other facilities of the GP or U.S.
Propane; and, provided further, however, that the Venturers shall not be
required to cause the GP, U.S. Propane or NewLP to disclose or make available to
the Acquirer any information or data the disclosure of which would violate any
confidential or non-disclosure obligation (other than any obligation exclusively
between or among one or more of the parties to this Agreement) to which the
party may be subject, provided that such party will use its reasonable
commercial efforts to limit the applicability of any confidential or
non-disclosure obligation to the extent reasonably practicable, including by (1)
obtaining a waiver thereof or (2) obtaining assurances from the Acquirer that
such information will remain confidential.

         (a) Acquirer agrees that at any time during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on November 6, 2009 NewLP and its Affiliates and
representatives shall have reasonable access to inspect and copy all books and
records of U.S. Propane relating to the Contributed Interests and Transferred
Interests (as such terms are defined in the Original Contribution Agreement) to
the extent that such access may reasonably be required in connection with
matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Business (as such term
is defined in the Original Contribution Agreement) prior to the Closing. U.S.
Propane shall, and shall cause the Heritage Parties to, afford such access upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. If U.S.
Propane or any of the Heritage Entities desire to dispose of any such books and
records prior to the expiration of such period, Acquirer agrees that U.S.
Propane shall, and shall cause such Heritage Party to, give NewLP a reasonable
opportunity, at its expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as
they select. NewLP shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses
incurred by it pursuant to this Section 7.1(b).

         7.2 MAINTENANCE OF BOOKS AND RECORDS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; REPORTS;
ETC. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the GP and U.S. Propane shall keep
adequate records and books of account with respect to each such Person's
business activities in which proper entries are made in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP reflecting all of their respective financial transactions.
The GP and U.S. Propane shall furnish to the Acquirer promptly after the sending
or filing thereof, as the case may be, copies of any financial statements or
reports that the GP or U.S. Propane has made available to its partners or
members.

         7.3 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The GP, U.S. Propane, NewLP, the Venturers,
the Acquirer and their respective Affiliates, will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other

                                       30

<PAGE>

the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Operative Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the advance approval of the other party
following such consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), except as each party may determine is required by
Applicable Law, court process or by the requirements of any securities exchange.

         7.4 CONDUCT AND PRESERVATION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE GP, U.S. PROPANE

Propane and their respective businesses consistent with available resources; and

to preserve intact the business organization of the GP and U.S. Propane and
their respective businesses, consistent with its available resources, to keep
available the services of the employees of the GP and U.S. Propane and to
maintain existing relationships with suppliers, contractors, distributors,
customers and others having business relationships with the GP and U.S. Propane.

         7.5 RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE GP, U.S. PROPANE AND OTHER
ENTITIES. Without limiting the generality of Section 7.4, except as otherwise
expressly contemplated by this Agreement and the Operative Documents, from and
after the date hereof and until the Closing Date, without the approval of the
Acquirer, with respect to the business of the GP and U.S. Propane:

         (a) None of the GP, U.S. Propane, any of the Venturers or, after its
formation, NewLP shall agree to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose, or grant or

this Agreement, the Venturers may cause the GP or U.S. Propane, at any time or
from time to time to distribute to their respective owners cash or cash
equivalents, to the extent that Current Assets exceed Current Liabilities at
such time.

         (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.5 or as otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement or the Operative Documents, none of the Venturers nor, after its
formation, NewLP shall cause or permit any of the GP or U.S. Propane to:

                  of, directly or indirectly, any of the Assets and Properties
                  of any such entity;

                           (vi)     enter into any lease, contract, agreement,

                  would have been paid in the ordinary course of business

                           (xii)    except as set forth in this Section 7.5,
                  take any action which would make any of the representations or
                  warranties of any of the Venturers untrue as of any time from
                  the date of this Agreement to the date of the Closing, or
                  would result in any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
                  this Agreement not being satisfied;

                           (xiii)   authorize or propose, or agree in writing or

<PAGE>

                  winding up of the business of such entity;

                           (xvii)   create any employee benefit plans (within

         (c) The Acquirer shall not take any action which would make any of the
representations and warranties of the Acquirer untrue as of any time from the
date of this Agreement to the date of Closing, or would result in any of the

         7.6 UPDATING SCHEDULES. The GP, U.S. Propane and the Venturers will,
promptly upon becoming aware of any fact, matter, circumstance or event, which
fact, matter, circumstance or event arose either (i) on or prior to the date
hereof (a "Pre-signing Event") or (ii) after the date hereof but prior to the
Closing (a "Post-Signing Event"), in any case, requiring supplementation or
amendment of the schedules provided by the Venturers in the Disclosure Schedules
of the Venturers, supplement or amend such schedules to this Agreement to
reflect any fact, matter, circumstance or event, which, if existing, occurring
or known on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such schedules which were or have been rendered inaccurate
thereby. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any such
supplements or amendments must be made prior to such date on which the last of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied
or waived by the party or parties entitled to waive the same, it being the
intention of the parties that such schedules may not be amended within 72 hours
prior to the Closing. All supplements and amendments to the schedules provided
by the Venturers are provided for the information of the Acquirer only and no
such supplement or amendment to the schedules shall (i) amend or supplement the
representations and warranties (and corresponding schedules) made as of the date
hereof or (ii) have any effect for the purpose of determining (A) satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof or (B) compliance by the GP,
U.S. Propane and the Venturers with their respective covenants and agreements
set forth herein; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs the Disclosure
Schedules as so supplemented or amended as of the Closing with respect to
Pre-Signing Events and Post-Signing Events shall be deemed to be the Disclosure
Schedules for purposes of determining whether or not any breach of the
representations and warranties of any of the Venturers has occurred.

         7.7 TAX REPORTING. The parties intend that this Agreement effect a sale
by U.S. Propane of the Retained Assets, including a general partner interest in
Heritage MLP and a general partner interest in Heritage OLP. The parties have
agreed to the transactions contemplated hereby in order to achieve the economic
and Tax consequences of such sales. In furtherance thereof, the parties agree to
report for federal income tax purposes the Tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that is consistent with the form (and

                                       33

<PAGE>

order) of the transactions described in Article 3, and in particular agree to
report the federal income tax consequences of such transactions as follows:

         (a) Each of US Propane and the GP is a partnership immediately prior to
the transaction for which provision is made in Section 3.2.

         (b) After the transfer of all of the equity in the GP to NewGP and the
transfer of all of the equity of U.S. Propane to NewLP as provided in Section
3.2, NewGP will be the continuation of the GP (that is, the same partnership for
federal income tax purposes as) and NewLP will be the continuation of (that is,
the same partnership for federal income tax purposes as) U.S. Propane, and the
GP and U.S. Propane are disregarded from and after such transfer until (at
least) all of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement have occurred.

         (c) The transfer of certain assets from U.S. Propane to NewLP and the
assumption by NewLP of certain liabilities of U.S. Propane, as provided in
Section 3.3, are each disregarded.

         (d) The purchase by Acquirer, as provided in Section 3.4, of the
Securities is treated as the purchase of the Assets and Properties of U.S.
Propane. The parties agree that the fair market value of each of the then Assets
and Properties of U.S. Propane is as set out in Schedule 7.7. Each of the
parties shall use such fair market values for all tax reporting purposes.
Further, the Parties agree that in determining the taxable income of each of the
Parties attributable to their ownership of interests in the Heritage MLP and
Heritage OLP for the taxable year of the Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP including
the Closing Date, Acquirer shall cause Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP to close
their books as of the Closing Date and to allocate the taxable income of
Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP for the period prior to the Closing Date allocable
to the Retained Assets to NewLP and the taxable income of Heritage MLP and
Heritage OLP allocable to the Retained Assets for the period beginning with the
Closing Date through the end of the taxable year to Acquirer. To the extent that
Heritage MLP or Heritage OLP is unable to close its books as of the Closing
Date, the Parties agree to cause the tax results to the Parties to equal as
nearly as possible those that would have resulted if the books of Heritage MLP
and Heritage OLP had been closed as provided in the preceding sentence.

In addition, each party agrees to so report the transactions for all other Tax
purposes in a manner consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section
7.7 unless such party receives a written opinion of counsel or its regular tax
adviser that one or more of such positions is not permitted under then
Applicable Law, in which case such party may then so report the transactions in
a manner that is inconsistent with the foregoing only after providing such
written opinion to the other parties hereto and consultation thereafter with
such other parties. The requirements of the foregoing (taking into account the
effect of the preceding sentence) are referred to herein as the "Reporting
Position." If any Tax authority proposes to characterize the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement as to a party in a manner that is inconsistent
with the Reporting Position, then such party agrees to contest such proposed
characterization in good faith using commercially reasonable efforts to defend
the Reporting Position and further agrees to keep the other parties hereto
reasonably informed as to the status of any such controversy. Likewise, the
Parties agree that Heritage OLP and Heritage MLP will allocate to NewLP taxable
income attributable to the amounts paid to NewLP pursuant to Section 3.3(f).

                                       34

         7.8 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Venturers shall cause NewLP to pay the out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of the GP, U.S. Propane, NewLP and the Venturers, on the one hand, and
the Acquirer shall pay its out-of-pocket fees and expenses, on the other hand,
incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the Closing
shall have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such out-of-pocket fees
and expenses incurred by the GP or U.S. Propane for time periods after the
Closing shall be paid by the GP, U.S. Propane or the Acquirer.

         7.9 ACTIONS BY PARTIES. Each party hereto agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth
in Article 8 and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to refrain from
taking any action within its control that would cause a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.
Each party hereto shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or
desirable, and proceed diligently and in good faith and shall use all reasonable
efforts to, as promptly as practicable, consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Operative Documents.

         7.10 EMPLOYEES OF U.S. PROPANE. The Acquirer shall not, at any time
prior to 60 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act ("WARN") affecting any employee of U.S. Propane or GP without
fully complying with the notice and other applicable requirements of WARN.

         7.11 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. The Acquirer will enforce the capital
commitments of the members of the Acquirer to make capital contributions to the
Acquirer, and will not permit the waiver, amendment or termination of (i) any of
such capital commitments, or (ii) any provision of the limited liability
agreement of the Acquirer that provides that the Venturers are third party
beneficiaries of the obligations of the members to make such capital
commitments.

         7.12 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TAX SHELTER REGULATIONS. Except as reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable securities laws and notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary (including the confidentiality provisions set
forth in Section 7.3 and Section 7.4) or in any other agreement to which a party
hereto is bound, the parties hereto (and each employee, representative, or other
agent of any of the parties) are expressly authorized to disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income "tax treatment"
and "tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg. Sections
1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9), respectively) of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to such parties relating to such "tax treatment" and
"tax structure" of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For these
purposes, "tax structure" is limited to facts relevant to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of the transaction described herein.

         7.13 TRADEMARKS, LOGOS, ETC. The Heritage Entities shall have the right
to continue to use all trademarks, service marks, trade names, service names and
logos (i) of AGL Propane Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, United Cities

Agreement dated June 15, 2000 among U.S. Propane, Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP,
except as specifically set forth on Schedule 7.13 (the "Trademarks"), until the
first anniversary of the Closing. From and after such first anniversary, the
Heritage Entities shall cease all use of the Trademarks, including all use of
the name "Peoples Gas."

         7.14 VOTE OF COMMON UNITS. Each of the Venturers hereby covenants and
agrees to vote, and to cause NewLP to vote at each meeting or other vote of the
holders of Common Units of Heritage MLP, with respect thereto, all of the Common
Units, if any, that such Venturer or NewLP may own as of the record date
established for determining the holders of Common Units entitled to vote at such
meeting or in such other vote for approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby and for approval of the conversion of the Class D Subordinated Units (as
defined in Amendment No. 5 to the Heritage MLP Partnership Agreement) to Common

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned by written notice at any time prior to the Closing
in any of the following manners:

         (a) concurrently with any permitted termination of the Contribution
Agreement; provided, however, that if the Contribution Agreement is terminated
due to a breach or default (i) by La Grange (as such term is defined in the
Contribution Agreement) of its obligations thereunder or a failure by La Grange
to satisfy its conditions to closing thereunder, this Agreement shall not be
terminated automatically but may be terminated by election of the Venturers
furnished in writing to the other parties hereto, or (ii) by Heritage MLP or
Heritage OLP of their respective obligations thereunder or a failure by Heritage
MLP or Heritage OLP to satisfy their conditions to closing thereunder, this
Agreement shall not be terminated automatically but may be terminated by
election of the Acquirer furnished in writing to the other parties hereto;

         (b) by written consent of each of the parties to this Agreement;

                                       39

<PAGE>

         (c) by any party if the Closing has not occurred on or before February
15, 2004, unless such failure to close resulted from a breach of this Agreement
by the party or its Affiliate seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(c);

         (d) by any party if (i) there is any statute, rule or regulation that
makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise
prohibited or (ii) a Governmental Authority (A) has issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable or (B)
has made any order, decree, ruling or other action consenting to or approving
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby contingent or conditional
in any manner that has a Material Adverse Effect, which order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

         (e) by any party, if there has been any violation or breach by any
other party (other than an Affiliate or related party of the first party) of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
has rendered impossible the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
such other party set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 and such violation or
breach has neither been cured within 30 days after notice by such first party to
the other party nor waived by the first party;

         (f) by any party, if any other event shall occur that shall render the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of any other party (other than
an Affiliate or related party of the first party) impossible and such condition
has not been waived by the other parties; or

         (g) by the Acquirer, if any amendment is made to any schedule in
accordance with Section 7.6 that in the Acquirer's reasonable judgment (i) with
respect to any Pre-Signing Event, is material or (ii) with respect to any
Post-Signing Event, the effect of the event or circumstance to which such
amendment relates materially impairs the financial condition, business,
properties, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the GP or U.S.
Propane.

         9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1 by any party, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination
is made. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, this Agreement shall
become void and have no effect, except that (a) the agreements contained in this
Section 9.2 and in Section 7.8 shall survive the termination hereof, (b) nothing
contained in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement and (c) nothing shall relieve any party from
any liability for a breach of its obligations hereunder existing at the time of
such termination. If this Agreement is terminated (y) because the Acquirer is
unable to arrange the funding necessary to consummate the Closing, the Acquirer
agrees to pay $500,000 to the Venturers or (z) by the Acquirer pursuant to
Section 9.1(g) because of an amendment to any schedule with respect to a
Pre-Signing Event, the Venturers agree to pay $500,000 to the Acquirer. The
parties stipulate and agree that (a) the $500,000 amount referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence shall constitute liquidated damages payable in
lieu of any other costs or expenses incurred by a party upon such termination,
shall constitute the sole remedy upon a termination in accordance with clause
(y) or (z) of the preceding sentence and (b) they each believe that such amounts
constitute a fair and

                                       40

<PAGE>

reasonable resolution if this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances
referred to in such clauses (y) or (z).

         9.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

         9.4 WAIVER. Any party may, on behalf of itself only and not on behalf
of any other party, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party (other than an Affiliate or related party of the
first party) contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto, (b) waive compliance by any other party (other than
an Affiliate or related party of the first party) with any of its agreements
contained herein and (c) waive fulfillment of any conditions to its obligations
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
such party. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

                                   ARTICLE X
                  INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

         10.1     INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF NEWLP AND THE VENTURERS. NewLP
and, if NewLP is unable to satisfy its obligations hereunder and, with respect
to each Venturer, only to the extent that a Venturer has received after the
Closing from NewLP any distribution of cash or property, each such Venturer
shall, except for indemnification in respect of the clause (b) below with
respect to the last sentence of Section 4.6, which indemnification shall only be
several as among NewLP and each of the Venturers, indemnify the Acquirer
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and hold the Acquirer Indemnified
Parties harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out
of, based upon or resulting from:

         (a) the breach of any representation or warranty of any Venturer
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (other than those in Section
4.2, Section 4.3, the last sentence of Section 4.6 or in Section 4.24);

         (b) the breach of any representation or warranty of any Venturer
contained in or made pursuant to Section 4.2, Section 4.3, the last sentence of
Section 4.6 or in Section 4.24;

         (c) the breach by any Venturer or the failure of any of the Venturers
to observe or perform in any material respect, any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any other Operative Document; and

         (d) the Assumed Liabilities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, NewLP and the Venturers will not have any
obligation to indemnify the Acquirer Indemnified Parties for Losses under
Section 10.1(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under
Section 10.1(a) exceeds $300,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third
party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, the
Venturers may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time NewLP and

                                       41

<PAGE>

the Venturers shall be liable for all Losses in excess of $300,000 and which do
not in the aggregate exceed $3,000,000. Notwithstanding anything else herein to
the contrary, none of the Venturers shall be required pursuant to this Section
10.1 to make any payment to any of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties for Losses
unless such Acquirer Indemnified Party has first sought to collect payment of
such Losses from NewLP and NewLP has failed or refused to make payment thereof
to the extent required under this Article 10, after which such Acquirer
Indemnified Party may, only to the extent specified in this Section 10.1, seek
payment of such Losses from a Venturer (unless the failure or refusal of NewLP
to make such payment is due to a good faith dispute regarding such Acquirer
Indemnified Party's right under this Section 10.1 to indemnification for such
Losses). The rights and remedies of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties based upon,
arising out of or otherwise in respect of any clause of this Section 10.1 or any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or other Operative
Documents shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such claim is based may also
be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement or other Operative Document that would not give rise to any rights or
remedies of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties.

         10.2     INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACQUIRER. The Acquirer,
shall indemnify the Venturer Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and hold
the Venturer Indemnified Parties harmless from, against and in respect of any
and all Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

         (a) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Acquirer
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (other than those in the second
and third sentences of Section 5.1 and in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4);

         (b) the breach of any representation or warranty of Acquirer contained
in or made pursuant to the second and third sentences of Section 5.1, or in
Section 5.3 or Section 5.4;

         (c) the breach by the Acquirer or failure of the Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates to observe or perform in any material respect, any of their covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other Operative Document; and

         (d) the Retained Liabilities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquirer will not have any obligation to
indemnify the Venturer Indemnified Parties for Losses under Section 10.2(a)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under Section 10.2(a)
exceeds $300,000 of the Purchase Price (regardless of whether, in the case of
third party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing,
the Acquirer may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time the
Acquirer shall be liable for all Losses in excess of $300,000 and which do not
in the aggregate exceed $3,000,000. The rights and remedies of the Venturer
Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any
clause of this Section 10.2 or any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement or other Operative Document shall in no way be limited by the fact
that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such
claim is based may also be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this

                                       42

<PAGE>

Agreement or other Operative Document that would not give rise to any rights or
remedies of the Venturer Indemnified Parties.

         10.3     INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

         (a) Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Article 10
(an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action against
such Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Action") in respect of which indemnity or
reimbursement may be sought against a party or parties required to make
indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement of such Third
Party Action, but the failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve it of any liability which it may have to any Acquirer Indemnified Party
under Section 10.1 or any Venturer Indemnified Party under Section 10.2, as
applicable, unless such failure actually and materially adversely affects the
defense of such Third Party Action. In case notice of commencement of any such
Third Party Action shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as above provided,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the
defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that:

                  (i)      the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
         participate in the defense of such Third Party Action and to employ
         counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such Third
         Party Action (provided that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
         reimbursement for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such
         counsel in accordance with subclauses (A) and (B) below in this Section
         10.3(a));

                  (ii)     the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
         approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed, before entering into any settlement
         of such Third Party Action or ceasing to defend against such Third
         Party Action, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
         cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
         against the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Party would be
         adversely affected thereby;

                  (iii)    no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of
         any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
         unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
         each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of
         such Third Party Action; and

                  (iv)     the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
         control the defense of any Third Party Action unless within 15 days
         after receipt of such written notice from the Indemnified Party, the
         Indemnifying Party confirms in writing its responsibility to indemnify
         the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Action and
         reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the full amount of
         the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any such Third Party
         Action.

Except as set forth in the following sentence, after written notice by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume control of
the defense of any such Third Party Action in accordance with the foregoing, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the

                                       43

<PAGE>

Indemnified Party hereunder for any fees and expenses of counsel subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party attributable to defending against such Third
Party Action, and (ii) as long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably
contesting such Third Party Action in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall
not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge the
claim underlying, such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party. If (A) the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Action in accordance with this Section 10.3(a),
or (B) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that
representation of such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same
counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such Third Party Action on behalf of the Indemnified Party), in
each case the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party
Action in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
to reimburse the Indemnified Parties for the costs and expenses of only a single
counsel for such Third Party Action and any matters related thereto and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or resolve such Third Party Action without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this
Article 10. The reimbursement of fees and expenses of counsel required by this
Article 10 shall be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

         (b) If the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the
indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 10, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to the claims to
which such indemnification relates. If an Indemnified Party becomes entitled to
any indemnification from an Indemnifying Party, such indemnification shall be
made in cash upon demand, unless the Indemnifying Party is disputing the right
of such Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder.

         (c) The right of indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the Parties to this
Agreement and their respective Affiliates, managers, directors, officers,
members, employees and other agents and representatives, other than with respect
to fraud or willful breach by a Party.

         10.4     SURVIVAL. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive (and not be affected in any
respect by) the Closing, any investigation conducted by any party and any
information that any party may receive (other than information identified in the
Schedules attached hereto).

                                       44

<PAGE>

         (a) The right to indemnification:

                  (i)      with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than
         those in the last sentence of Section 4.6, or Sections 4.11, 4.18,
         4.22, 4.24 and 5.4), shall survive for one (1) year from the Closing
         Date;

                  (ii)     with respect to any breach of violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in the last sentence of
         Section 4.6 and in Sections 4.24 or 5.4, shall survive indefinitely;

                  (iii)    with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.11, 4.18 and
         4.22, shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations; and

                  (iv)     with respect to all covenants and agreements
         contained in this Agreement, shall survive for the applicable statute
         of limitations (including all periods of extension thereof, whether
         automatic or permissive).

         (b) The expiration of any survival period under this Agreement will not
affect the liability of any Party under this Article 10 for any Losses as to
which a bona fide claim has been asserted prior to the termination of such
survival period.

         10.5     NO SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. No party and no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover special, consequential, exemplary
or punitive damages from the other parties or any Indemnifying Party in
connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article 10 or
otherwise, and each party hereby waives any claim or right to special,
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages hereunder, even if caused by the
active, passive, sole, joint, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict
liability, or other fault of any party, other than fraud or intentional
misconduct.

         10.6     LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) Neither NewLP nor any of the Venturers shall have any obligation to
indemnify the Acquirer Indemnified Parties hereunder with respect to any breach
of a representation or warranty of the Venturers resulting from a Pre-Signing
Event or Post-Signing Event to the extent that the Disclosure Schedules of the
Venturers to this Agreement were amended or supplemented in accordance with
Section 7.6 to reflect such Pre-Signing Event or Post-Signing Event prior to
Closing. Following the Closing, the determination of whether any of the
Venturers have breached any of their representations or warranties shall be
determined on the basis of the Disclosure Schedules of the Venturers as amended
or supplemented as of the Closing.

         11.2     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (where applicable, as
executed and delivered), and that certain letter agreement, dated September 15,
2003, among Acquirer and the Venturers, constitute the entire agreement between
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

         11.3     BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFIT. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) by any party without the prior written consent
of each of the parties, and any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void; provided, however, that Acquirer may assign its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Acquirer without the prior
written consent of any of the other parties, but no such assignment shall
relieve the Acquirer of its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in Article
10, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties, and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

         11.4     SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and such provision
shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed unenforceable, and in all
other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that if any such provision may be made enforceable by limitation
thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be so limited and shall be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

         11.5     GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

         11.6     JURISDICTION. Any legal action, suit or proceeding in law or
equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may only be instituted in any state or federal
court located in the State of Texas, and each party agrees not to assert, by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the
action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court. Each
party further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any
such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any other
notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against any
party if given by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or by
any other means which requires a signed receipt in accordance with, and at the
address listed in, Section 10.1. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

         11.7     FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time following the Closing,
at the request of any party and without further consideration, the other parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such instruments and
documents and take such other action as such requesting party may reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to (a) cause the Acquirer, the GP, U.S.
Propane, NewLP or the Venturers to fulfill their respective obligations under
this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and (b) otherwise consummate
more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Operative Documents.

         11.8     DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

         11.9     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
