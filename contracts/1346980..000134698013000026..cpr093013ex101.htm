ARTICLE III 
CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

3.1 Consideration. The consideration for the sale and conveyance of the Assets
to Buyer is One Hundred Sixty Million One Hundred Twenty-Eight Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($160,128,000), as adjusted in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (the "Purchase Price"). The "Adjusted Purchase Price" shall be
the Purchase Price (i) as adjusted by the Initial Adjustment Amount, (ii) as
may be adjusted for Title Defects, if any, in accordance with Section 6.2,
(iii) as may be adjusted for excluded Title Defect Properties, if any, in
accordance with Section 6.5, (iv) as may be adjusted for payments of portions
of the Purchase Price received by Seller from holders of Preference Rights
contemporaneously with Closing in accordance with and as contemplated by
Section 7.2, (v) as may be adjusted on account of Retained Assets as
contemplated by Section 7.3, and (vi) as adjusted downward by an amount equal
to the aggregate amount of proceeds which Seller is holding in suspense as of
the Effective Time in respect of past production of oil, gas or other
hydrocarbons attributable to the Assets.

3.2 Payment. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has
deposited an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price with
Seller as a deposit hereunder (the "Deposit"). At the Closing, Buyer shall
wire transfer the Adjusted Purchase Price minus the Deposit in immediately
available funds to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., ABA No. 021000021 for the
account of Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation, Account No. 636462608, or such other
account specified by Seller to Buyer on or prior to the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

3.3 Adjustments.

(a) The Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by
an amount equal to the Net Cash Flow with respect to the Assets for the time
period (the "Adjustment Period") beginning at the Effective Time and ending at
7:00 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date. Seller shall deliver to Buyer on
or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date a 

statement (the "Adjustment Statement") setting forth Seller's preliminary
determination ("Initial Adjustment Amount") of the Net Cash Flow. If the
Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the Adjustment Statement is a positive
number, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by such amount. If the
Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the Adjustment Statement is a negative
number, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by such amount.

(b) The Adjustment Statement shall be based upon actual information available
to Seller at the time of its preparation and upon Seller's good faith
estimates and assumptions. There shall be attached to the Adjustment Statement
such supporting documentation and other data as is reasonably necessary to
provide a basis for the Net Cash Flow shown therein.

(c) The "Net Cash Flow" shall be the sum of (i) a positive amount equal to the
aggregate amount paid by Seller as Seller's share of the costs and expenses of
exploration, maintenance, development, production and operation of the Assets
incurred with respect to the Adjustment Period (including prepayments of any
such costs or expenses but excluding overhead charges, costs or expenses),
(ii) a positive amount equal to the sum of (A) all overhead charges paid by
Seller to any operator of any of the Assets, and (B) with respect to any
properties operated by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, the overhead charges
payable to Seller or such affiliated operator on account of the Subject
Interests in such properties under existing operating agreements or, if no
overhead charge is applicable to a Subject Interest under an existing
operating agreement, an overhead charge to such Subject Interest equal to
$10,000 per month for each drilling well and $1,000 per month for each
producing well attributable to each such Subject Interest, and (iii) a
negative amount equal to the aggregate net proceeds received by Seller from
the sale or disposition of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced from the
Assets during the Adjustment Period or from the rental, sale, salvage or other
disposition of any other Assets during the Adjustment Period.

3.4 Post Closing Review. After the Closing, Seller shall review the Adjustment
Statement and determine the actual Net Cash Flow. On or prior to the ninetieth
(90th) day after the Closing Date, Seller shall present Buyer with a statement
of the actual Net Cash Flow and such supporting documentation as is reasonably
necessary to support the Net Cash Flow shown therein (the "Final Adjustment
Statement"). Buyer will give representatives of Seller reasonable access to
its premises and to its books and records for purposes of preparing the Final
Adjustment Statement and will cause appropriate personnel of Buyer to assist
Seller and Seller's representatives, at no cost to Seller, in the preparation
of the Final Adjustment Statement. Seller will give representatives of Buyer
reasonable access to its premises and to its books and records for purposes of
reviewing the calculation of Net Cash Flow and will cause appropriate
personnel of Seller to assist Buyer and its representatives, at no cost to
Buyer, in verification of such calculation. The Final Adjustment Statement
shall become final and binding on Seller and Buyer as to the Net Cash Flow
thirty (30) days following the date the Final Adjustment Statement is received
by Buyer, except to the extent that prior to the expiration of such thirty
(30) day period Buyer shall deliver to Seller notice, as hereinafter required,
of its disagreement with the contents of the Final Adjustment Statement. Such
notice shall be in writing and set forth all of Buyer's disagreements with
respect to any portion of the Final Adjustment Statement, together with
Buyer's proposed changes thereto, and shall include an explanation in
reasonable detail of, and such supporting documentation as is reasonably
necessary to support, such changes. If Buyer has timely delivered such a
notice of disagreement to Seller, 

then, upon written agreement between Buyer and Seller resolving all
disagreements of Buyer set forth in such notice, the Final Adjustment
Statement will become final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Net
Cash Flow. If the Final Adjustment Statement has not become final and binding
by the sixtieth (60th) day following its receipt by Buyer, then Buyer or
Seller may submit any unresolved disagreements of Buyer set forth in such
notice to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration
Procedures. Upon resolution of such unresolved disagreements of Buyer, the
Final Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as
to the Net Cash Flow. Within three (3) Business Days after the Final
Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding, Seller or Buyer, as
appropriate, shall pay to the other Party the amount, if any, by which the Net
Cash Flow as shown in the Final Adjustment Statement, is less than or exceeds
the Initial Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date until paid at the Agreed Rate.

or constitute a default under the terms, conditions or provisions of any
agreement, instrument or obligation to which Seller is a party or is bound; or
(iii) violate or be rendered void or ineffective under any Law applicable to

Seller which relate to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than Actions which are not reasonably expected by Seller to

violations of Law which would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(g) Material Contracts. Schedule 4.1(g) sets forth a list of all Material
Contracts that exist as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on

knowledge of Seller, no other Person is in breach of, or default under, any
Material Contract, and there does not exist under any provision thereof, to
the knowledge of Seller, any event that, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default by any Person
(exclusive of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller), except for such breaches,
defaults and events which would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(h) Tax Matters.

(i) Except for Taxes being contested in good faith, each material Tax Return
required to be filed with respect to the Assets has been timely and properly
filed and all material Taxes with respect to the Assets have been timely and
properly paid. All such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material

for expenditure or other commitments to conduct any operations or expend any
amount of money on or with respect to the Assets which are binding on Seller

$250,000.00 for any such operation (net to Seller's interest).

(k) Environmental. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(k):

(i) to the knowledge of Seller as of the date of this Agreement, the Assets

transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Buyer shall incur any
liability.

(m) Bankruptcy. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement
proceedings pending against, being contemplated by, or, to the knowledge of

transportation or redelivery of gas produced from the Assets for which Buyer
will have any liability or obligation in connection with or after the Closing.

(o) Suspense Accounts, Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1(o), as of the date
set forth on such schedule, Seller does not hold any funds in suspense with
respect to any of the Assets.

ARTICLE V 
INVESTIGATION OF ASSETS; CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1 Investigation of Assets. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement and until the Closing (or earlier termination of this Agreement),
Seller (i) shall permit Buyer and its representatives at reasonable times to
examine, in Seller's offices, all abstracts of title, title opinions, title
files, ownership maps, lease files, assignments, division orders, and other
Records relating to the Assets insofar as the same are in Seller's possession
and insofar as Seller may do so without (a) violating legal constraints or any
legal obligation or (b) waiving any attorney/client privilege (other than with
respect to title opinions and title curative correspondence) and (ii), subject
to any required consent of any third Person, shall permit Buyer and its
representatives at reasonable times and at Buyer's sole risk, cost and
expense, to conduct, in the presence of Seller's representatives, reasonable
inspections of the Assets; provided, however, that Buyer shall not conduct any
Phase II environmental testing or other invasive surface or subsurface testing
without Seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, Buyer shall repair any damage to the
Assets resulting from such inspections and Buyer does hereby indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons from and against any and all
Covered Liabilities to 

the extent arising from Buyer's inspection of the Assets, REGARDLESS OF ANY
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY ON THE PART OF ANY SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PERSON AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF CLAIM WHETHER AT COMMON LAW,
STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION, EXCLUDING,
HOWEVER, THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PERSON. Seller also shall permit Buyer and its representatives, both before
and for a reasonable time after Closing, to examine, in Seller's offices at
reasonable times, all financial and operating records and reports maintained
by Seller with respect to the Assets, including, without limitation, lease
operating statements and similar financial statements and reports, and have
reasonable access to members of Seller's accounting staff, as necessary to
permit Buyer to create an historical financial data base with respect to
operations on the Assets and to conduct a revenue and expense audit of the
Assets as necessary to comply with regulatory filings required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and shall permit and facilitate
communication by Buyer with Seller's independent auditors for such purpose.

5.2 Confidential Information. Buyer agrees to maintain all information made
available to it pursuant to Section 5.1 confidential and to cause its
officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to maintain all
information made available to them pursuant to Section 5.1 confidential, all
as provided in that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated September 14, 2013
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Seller and Buyer, the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE VI 
TITLE ADJUSTMENTS

6.1 No Warranty or Representation. Without limiting Buyer's right to adjust
the Purchase Price by operation of Section 6.2 and Section 6.5 and except for
the special warranty of title which is contained in the Conveyance, Seller
makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
with respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided above, Buyer's sole remedy
for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of
the Assets shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article VI,
which remedies (other than those provided for in Section 6.5) shall cease, and
be deemed to be finally and conclusively satisfied, in all respects, upon the
Closing. Furthermore, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the accuracy or completeness
of the information, records and data now, heretofore or hereafter made
available to Buyer in connection with this Agreement (including, without
limitation, any description of the Assets, pricing assumptions, potential for
production of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons from the Subject Interests or any
other matters contained in or related to the Reserve Report or any other
material furnished to Buyer by Seller or by Seller's agents or
representatives).

6.2 Buyer's Title Review.

(a) Buyer's Assertion of Title Defects. During the period commencing on the
execution of this Agreement and terminating on December 6, 2013 (the "Title
Examination Period"), Buyer 

shall notify Seller in writing of any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title
Defect with respect to any portion of a Property Subdivision pursuant to this
Article VI. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by
written notice given to Seller on or before the expiration of the Title
Examination Period. To be effective, Buyer's written notice of a Title Defect
must include (i) a brief description of the matter constituting the asserted
Title Defect, (ii) the claimed Title Defect Amount attributable thereto, and
(iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any
title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of such
asserted Title Defect. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to give Seller written notice of any Title
Defect which Buyer determines exists promptly following Buyer's determination
of the existence of same, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the end of the Title Examination Period. Buyer shall
also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Seller Title Credit
which is discovered by any of Buyer's employees or representatives while
conducting Buyer's title review, due diligence or investigation with respect
to the Subject Interests and Property Subdivisions.

(b) Purchase Price Allocations. A portion of the Purchase Price has been
allocated by Buyer to the various Subject Interests in Property Subdivisions
in the manner and in accordance with the respective values set forth in Part
II of the Property Schedule. If any adjustment is made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 6.2, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the affected Property Subdivision
in Part II of the Property Schedule.

(c) Seller's Opportunity to Cure. Seller shall have ten (10) days after the
expiration of the Title Examination Period, at its cost and expense, if it so
elects but without obligation, to cure all or a portion of such asserted Title
Defects at Seller's sole cost and expense. Any asserted Title Defects which
are waived by Buyer or cured within such time shall be deemed "Permitted
Encumbrances" hereunder. If Seller within such time fails to cure any Title
Defect of which Buyer has given timely written notice as required above and
Buyer has not and does not waive same on or before the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Property Subdivision affected by such uncured
and unwaived Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property".

(d) Buyer's Title Adjustments. Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6, as Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to Title Defects, Buyer shall be
entitled to reduce the Purchase Price by the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect
Properties exceeds an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Title Defect Deductible") plus the aggregate amount of
Seller Title Credits with respect to all Property Subdivisions. As used
herein, the term "Title Defect Amount" shall mean, with respect to a Title
Defect Property, the amount by which the value of such Title Defect Property
is impaired as a result of the existence of one or more uncured and unwaived
Title Defects, which amount shall be determined as follows:

(1) If the Title Defect results from Seller having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall
be equal to the product obtained by 

multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect
Property in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the reduction in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in
Part II(A) of the Property Schedule.

(2) If the Title Defect results from Seller having a greater Working Interest
in a Title Defect Property set forth in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule
than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property
Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the present value
(discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the increase in the costs and
expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with respect to such Title Defect
Property for the period from and after the Effective Time which is
attributable to such increase in Seller's Working Interest; provided, however,
that no Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to the extent
that an increase in Seller's Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision
has the effect of proportionately increasing Seller's Net Revenue Interest
therein.

(3) If the Title Defect results from Seller having fewer number of Net Acres
in a Title Defect Property set forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule
than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property
Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect
Property in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the reduction in the Net Acres and the denominator of which is the
number of Net Acres specified for such Title Defect Property in Part II(B) of
the Property Schedule.

(4) If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien, the Title Defect
Amount shall be an amount sufficient to discharge such lien.

(5) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal
to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by
such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect
Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated in Part II of the Property Schedule to such Title
Defect Property); provided, however, if such Title Defect is reasonably
susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than
the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect.

(6) If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect
Property throughout the entire productive life of such Title Defect Property,
such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.

(7) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a lien
affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect
to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the
curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title 

Defect Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and
expense of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect
Amount for one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect
Amount.

(8) If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision (as
contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Property
Subdivision) and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated
specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in the Property
Schedule, then for purposes of computing the Title Defect Amount, the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision shall be further
allocated among the portions of such Property Subdivision in the proportion
that the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) of such Property
Subdivision affected by such Title Defect bears to the net acreage (or net
acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property Subdivision. In the event
such Property Subdivision is subject to a unitization agreement, the foregoing
allocation shall be made in a manner which is consistent with the allocation
of production or productive acreage in such unitization agreement.

(9) The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or any
portion thereof shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such Title Defect Property or such portion thereof calculated in accordance
with paragraph (8) above. For example, but without limitation, if Seller does
not own fifty percent (50%) of the Net Revenue Interest specified in the
Property Schedule for a Title Defect Property and such unowned fifty percent
(50%) interest is also burdened by a lien, the Title Defect Amount for such
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price
allocable to such fifty percent (50%) interest notwithstanding that it may be
affected by multiple Title Defects.

(10) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to the foregoing with respect to a Title Defect Property is $20,000
or less (or, with respect to a Title Defect affecting a Property Subdivision
described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, $20,000 or less per oil and
gas lease affected thereby), then the Title Defect Amount with respect to such
Title Defect Property (or, with respect to a Title Defect affecting a Property
Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect
Amount with respect to such oil and gas lease) shall be deemed to be zero.

The Title Defect Deductible shall be restored to the extent that any portion
thereof is applied as a credit against a Title Defect Amount attributable to a
Title Defect which is subsequently cured by Seller or determined not to
constitute a Title Defect.

6.3 Determination of Title Defects. A portion of a Property Subdivision shall
be deemed to have a "Title Defect" if Seller does not have Defensible Title
thereto as of the Effective Time and as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters
shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and shall not be asserted as, and
shall not constitute Title Defects: (a) defects in the early chain of the
title consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document or
omissions of successions of heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides
affirmative evidence that such failure or omission results in another Person's
superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion
thereof, (b) defects arising out of lack of survey, (c) defects arising out of
lack of corporate authorization, 

unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate action was not
authorized and results in another Person's superior claim of title to the
relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof, (d) defects that have been
cured by possession under the applicable statutes of limitations or
prescription, (e) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to
probate proceedings or the lack thereof, which defects or irregularities have
been outstanding for four (4) years or more, (f) defects based solely on the
existence of prior oil and gas leases relating to the Subject Interests that
are expired and no longer in force and legal effect but not surrendered of
record, (g) defects arising from a mortgage encumbering the oil, gas or
mineral estate of any lessor (unless a complaint of foreclosure has been filed
or any similar action taken by the mortgagee thereunder and in such case such
mortgage has not been subordinated to the Subject Interests affected thereby),
(h) defects based solely on lack of information in Seller's files or
references to documents if such documents are not in Seller's files, and (i)
defects in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1950, unless Buyer provides
affirmative evidence that the defect results in another Person's superior
claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof.

6.4 Seller Title Credit. A "Seller Title Credit" shall mean, with respect to a
Property Subdivision, the amount by which the value of such Property
Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of (a) Seller having a greater Net Revenue
Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, (b) with respect to each
Property Subdivision described in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, Seller
having a lesser Working Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Working
Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule without a
corresponding reduction in Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Property
Subdivision specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule or (c)
with respect to each Property Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the
Property Schedule, Seller having a greater number of Net Acres than the number
of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule. The
amount of Seller Title Credits shall be determined as follows:

(1) If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest
specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title
Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of the
Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the
Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of the Property
Schedule.

(2) If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a lesser Working
Interest in a Property Subdivision than the Working Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule without a corresponding
reduction in Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Property Subdivision
specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title
Credit shall be equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded
annually) of the decrease in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve
Report with respect to such Property Subdivision for the period from and after
the Effective Time which is attributable to such decrease in Seller\'s Working
Interest; provided, however, no Seller Title Credit shall be allowed on
account of and to the extent that a decrease in Seller's 

Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision has the effect of
proportionately decreasing Seller's Net Revenue Interest therein.

(3) If the Title Defect results from Buyer having greater number of Net Acres
in a Property Subdivision than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in
Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to
the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the Net Acres and the
denominator of which is the number of Net Acres specified for such Property
Subdivision in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule.

(4) In determining the amount of Seller Title Credits, the principles and
methodology set forth in paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (10) of Section 6.2(d)
shall be applied, mutatis mutandis.

6.5 Exclusion of Title Defect Properties. On or before the Closing Date,
Seller may with respect to any Title Defect Property elect to retain and
exclude such Title Defect Property from the Assets to be conveyed by Seller to
Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof so long as the Purchase Price is reduced by
the portion of the Purchase Price allocated (or deemed allocated pursuant to
Section 6.2(d)(8)) to such Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property
Schedule. In the event Seller exercises its right under this Section 6.5 with
respect to a Title Defect Property, said Title Defect Property, together with
a pro rata share of all incidental rights, oil, gas and other hydrocarbons and
other assets attributable or appurtenant thereto, shall be retained by Seller
and excluded from the Assets which are conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
the Conveyance.

6.6 Deferred Claims and Disputes. In the event that Buyer and Seller have not
agreed upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by Buyer or
Seller pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this Article VI,
any such claim (a "Deferred Adjustment Claim") shall be settled pursuant to
this Section 6.6 and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.2(e), shall
not prevent or delay Closing. With respect to each potential Deferred
Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other a written notice
describing each such potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, the amount in
dispute and a statement setting forth the facts and circumstances that support
such Party's position with respect to such Deferred Adjustment Claim. At
Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on account of, and, except
as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.2(e), no effect shall be given to, the
Deferred Adjustment Claim. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) consecutive
calendar day following the Closing Date (the "Deferred Matters Date"), Seller
and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Deferred
Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve by written agreement all
disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment Claims. Any Deferred Adjustment
Claims which are not so resolved on or before the Deferred Matters Date shall
be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration Procedures; provided, however, that Seller may elect at any time
to resolve all disputes relating to the Deferred Adjustment Claims by the
payment to Buyer of the amount by which the Purchase Price would have been
reduced at Closing on account of the Title Defects which constitute Deferred
Adjustment Claims if same did not constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims.
Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, including Section
6.2(c), Seller shall be 

entitled to cure any Title Defect which constitutes a Deferred Adjustment
Claim at any time prior to the point in time when a final and binding written
decision of the board of arbitrators is made with respect thereto in
accordance with the Arbitration Procedures. The amount of any reduction in the
Purchase Price to which Buyer becomes entitled under the final and binding
written decision of the board of arbitrators shall be promptly refunded by
Seller to Buyer together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until
paid at the Agreed Rate.

6.7 No Duplication. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary,
if a Title Defect results from any matter which could also result in the
breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Section 4.1,
then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title Defect
pursuant to this Article VI and shall be precluded from also asserting such
matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty.

ARTICLE VII 
PREFERENCE RIGHTS AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Compliance. Buyer's purchase of the Assets is expressly subject to all
validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements.
To Seller's knowledge, all agreements containing a (i) Preference Right are
set forth in Part I of Schedule 7.1 and (ii) Transfer Requirement are set
forth in Part II of Schedule 7.1. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
initiate all procedures required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all
Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth on Schedule 7.1 with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall not
be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the
benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement in
order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

7.2 Effect of Preference Rights. If a third party who has been offered a
Preference Property pursuant to Section 7.1 elects prior to Closing to
purchase such Preference Property in accordance with the terms of such
Preference Right, and Seller receives written notice of such election prior to
the Closing Date, such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Assets
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Preference Property pursuant to the immediately following
sentence. The portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to any Asset or
portion thereof affected by a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") shall
be the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto in Part II of the
Property Schedule. If a Preference Right affects only a portion of a Property
Subdivision and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated
specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in Part II of the
Property Schedule, then the portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to
such Preference Property shall be determined in the same manner as provided in
Section 6.2(d)(8) when a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property
Subdivision. If a third party who has been offered a Preference Property or
who has been requested to waive its Preference Right pursuant to Section 7.1
does not elect to purchase such Preference Property or waive such Preference
Right with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to
the Closing Date, such Preference Property shall be conveyed to Buyer at
Closing subject to such Preference Right, unless such Preference Property has
been otherwise eliminated from the Assets in accordance with other provisions
of this Agreement. If a third party elects to purchase a Preference Property
subject to a Preference Right 

and Closing has already occurred with respect to such Preference Property,
Buyer shall be obligated to convey said Preference Property to such third
party and shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of such
Preference Property.

7.3 Transfer Requirements. If a Transfer Requirement is applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to satisfy such
Transfer Requirement would, by its express terms and applicable Law, render
the assignment of an Asset void or result in termination thereof, is not
obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date,
then, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, (i) any
Asset or portion thereof affected by such Transfer Requirement (a "Retained
Asset") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to
Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced
by the portion of the Purchase Price which would be allocated to such Retained
Asset pursuant to Section 7.2 if such Retained Asset were a Preference
Property. Any Retained Asset so held back at the Closing will be conveyed to
Buyer within ten (10) days following the date on which Seller obtains,
complies with or otherwise satisfies all Transfer Requirements with respect to
such Retained Asset for a purchase price equal to the amount by which the
Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained
Asset, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4; provided, however, if all Transfer
Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the Closing
are not obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied within one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Closing Date, then such Retained Asset shall
be eliminated from the Assets and this Agreement unless Seller and Buyer
mutually agree to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset in which case
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any objection with respect to non-
compliance with such Transfer Requirements.

7.4 Certain Governmental Consents. Seller and Buyer will each use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts after Closing to obtain all
approvals and consents from the United States Department of Interior and the
applicable state or Indian agencies or authorities that may be required under
the terms of (or regulations specifically applicable to) any federal, state or
Indian leases in connection with the assignment of the Subject Interests
therein from Seller to Buyer. Until such approvals and consents are obtained,
Seller shall continue to hold legal title to such Subject Interests as nominee
for Buyer. Seller shall not be obligated to incur any costs or expenses in
Seller's capacity as nominee. For purposes of Article XIII, Seller and Buyer
shall treat and deal with such Subject Interests as if full legal and
equitable title to such Subject Interests had passed from Seller to Buyer at
Closing.

7.5 Express Conditions on Sale. Buyer acknowledges that Seller desires to sell
all of the Assets and would not have entered into this Agreement but for
Buyer's agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided.
Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller does not desire
to sell any Preference Property unless the sale of all or substantially all of
the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller's obligation hereunder
to sell the Preference Properties to Buyer is expressly conditioned upon the
consummation by the Closing Date of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, either by conveyance to Buyer, exclusion by Seller or conveyance
pursuant to an applicable Preference Right; provided that, nothing herein is
intended or shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any
portion of the Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby. 

Time is of the essence with respect to the Parties' agreement to consummate
the sale of the Assets by the Closing Date.

ARTICLE VIII 
COVENANTS OF SELLER AND BUYER

8.1 Conduct of Business Pending Closing. Subject to Section 8.2 and the
constraints of applicable operating and other agreements, from the date hereof
through the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement), except as
disclosed on Schedule 8.1, or as otherwise consented to or approved by Buyer
in writing (which consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Seller covenants and agrees that:

(a) Sales. Seller shall not sell, transfer, assign, convey, farmout, release,
abandon or otherwise dispose of any Assets, or enter into any transaction the
effect of which would be to cause Seller's ownership interest in any of the
Assets to be altered from Seller's ownership interest as of the date of this
Agreement, other than (i) oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced, saved and
sold in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) personal property or
equipment which is replaced with personal property or equipment of comparable
or better value and utility in connection with the maintenance and operation

operations on the Assets the cost of which (net to Seller's interest) is in

of Buyer, which consent or non‑consent must be given by Buyer within the
lesser of (x) ten (10) days of Buyer's receipt of the notice from Seller or
(y) one-half (½) of the applicable notice period within which Seller is
contractually obligated to respond to third parties to avoid a deemed election
by Seller regarding such operation, as specified in Seller's notice to Buyer
requesting such consent; provided that, failure by Buyer to respond within the
aforesaid applicable period shall constitute Buyer's consent to Seller's
participation in such well or other operation;

(iv) maintain and keep the Assets in full force and effect, including, without
limitation, the timely and proper payment of all delay rentals and the timely
and proper exercise of optional renewals or primary term extensions under all
of the undeveloped leases included in the Assets for which expiration is
scheduled to occur on or before January 31, 2014, except where such failure is
due to (i) the failure to pay a delay rental, royalty, shut in royalty or
other payment by mistake or oversight (including Seller's negligence) unless 

caused by Seller's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) the failure
to participate in an operation which Buyer does not timely approve;

(v) not elect to go non-consent on any operation on the Assets proposed by a
third party, subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(b);

(vi) use Seller's commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its
relationships with suppliers, customers and others having material business
relations with Seller with respect to the Assets so that they will be
preserved for Buyer on and after the Closing Date;

(vi) subject to the immediately following sentence, not later than November 7,
2013, initiate and diligently continue repair, work or re-work, as applicable,
on the John W. Morgan "A" 1 Well located in Section 1, Township 1 North, Range
20 East CM, Beaver County, Oklahoma, to attempt to return such well to
production on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8.1(c), Seller shall not perform any operation on
such well in excess of $50,000 without the advance written consent of Buyer.

(d) Contracts and Agreements. Seller shall not:

(iii) grant or create any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement with
respect to the Assets except in connection with the performance by Seller of
an obligation or agreement existing on the date hereof or pursuant to this
Agreement;

(iv) enter into any oil, gas or other hydrocarbon sales, supply, exchange,
processing or transportation contract with respect to the Assets which is not
terminable without penalty or detriment on notice of sixty (60) days or less;

the Assets.

(e) Qualifications on Seller's Conduct. Seller shall:

or violation of Law or any investigation, suit, action or litigation by or
before a Governmental Authority, that (in each case) relates to the Assets and
of which Seller has knowledge; 

(i) not enter into any contract that would have been a Material Contract if it
had been in effect on the date hereof; and

(ii) not amend, modify or terminate any Material Contract or otherwise waive,
release or assign any material rights, claims or benefits of Seller under any
Material Contract (except for amendments or modifications to (A) compressor
contracts for the purpose of obtaining additional compressors and (B) oil, gas
or other hydrocarbon sales contracts for the purpose of selling oil, gas or
other hydrocarbons included in the Assets on the terms provided by such
existing contracts).

8.2 Emergencies; Legal Requirements. Seller may take (or not take, as the case
may be) any of the actions mentioned in Section 8.1 above if reasonably
necessary under emergency circumstances (or if required or prohibited (as the
case may be) pursuant to Law) and provided Buyer is notified as soon
thereafter as practicable.

(b) Non‑Operated Properties. If Seller is not the operator of a particular
portion of the Assets, the obligations of Seller in Section 8.1 above with
respect to such portion of the Assets, which have reference to operations or
activities which pursuant to existing contracts are carried out or performed
by the operator, shall be construed to require only that Seller use
commercially reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense
or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of such portion of the
Assets to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints
of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.

(c) Certain Operations. Should Seller not wish to pay any lease rental or
other payment or participate in any reworking, deepening, drilling,
completion, equipping or other operation on or with respect to any well or
other Property Subdivision which may otherwise be required by Section 8.1
above, Seller shall give Buyer written notice thereof at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date such rental or other payment is due or, in the case of
an operation, promptly after Seller receives notice of such proposed operation
from the operator of such property (or if Seller is the operator, at the same
time Seller gives or is required to give notice of such proposed operation to
the non‑operators of such property); and Seller shall not be obligated to make
any such payment or to elect to participate in any such operation which Seller
does not wish to make or participate in unless Seller receives from Buyer,
within a reasonable time prior to the date when such payment or election is
required to be made by Seller, the written election and agreement of Buyer (i)
to require Seller to take such action and (ii) to pay all costs and expenses
of Seller with respect to such lease rental or other payment or such
operation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be obligated to pay
any lease rental or other payment or to elect to participate in any operation
if the operator of the property involved recommends that such action not be
taken. If Buyer advances any funds pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) with
respect to a particular portion of the Assets, such portion of the Assets is
not conveyed to Buyer at Closing or Closing does not occur, and such funds are
not reimbursed to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the earlier of Closing
or termination of this Agreement, then, with respect to such particular
portion of the Assets, (i) Buyer shall own and be entitled to any interest of
Seller that would have lapsed but for such payment or (ii) in the case of
operations, Buyer shall be entitled to receive the penalty, if any, that
Seller, as nonconsenting party, would have suffered under the applicable
operating or other agreement with respect to such 

operations as if Buyer were a consenting party thereunder; in each case,
subject to and after deduction of any damages or other relief to which Seller
may be entitled with respect to any breach by Buyer of this Agreement.

8.3 Conveyance. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall execute and
deliver or cause the execution and delivery of the General Conveyance, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.3 (the "Conveyance"),
together with all special federal, state and tribal assignment forms as may be
required by Law to be executed in connection with the conveyance of specific
Assets; provided that, the terms and provisions of the Conveyance shall
control as to any conflict between the Conveyance and any such special
assignment forms.

8.4 Public Announcements. Without the prior written approval of the other
Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, no Party will issue,
or permit any agent or Affiliate to issue, any press releases or otherwise
make, or cause any agent or Affiliate to make, any public statements with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except
where such release or statement is deemed in good faith by the releasing Party
to be required by Law or any national securities exchange, in which case the
Party or Parties will use its or their, as the case may be, commercially
reasonable efforts to provide a copy to the other Party prior to any release
or statement.

8.5 Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer each agrees that, from time to time,
whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and
deliver or cause their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other action as
may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement. Any
separate or additional assignment of the Assets or any portion thereof
required pursuant to this Section 8.5 (i) shall evidence the conveyance and
assignment of the Assets made or intended to be made in the Conveyance, (ii)
shall not modify or be deemed to modify any of the terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Conveyance, and (iii) shall be deemed to contain
all of the terms and provisions of the Conveyance, as fully as though the same
were set forth at length in such separate or additional assignment.

8.6 Removal. Buyer shall have no right to use the name or mark of Seller or
any of its Affiliates (or any variation or derivative thereof) or the logos
relating thereto and, as promptly as practicable, but in any case within sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall remove the name and mark of
Seller and any of its Affiliates and any variations and derivatives thereof
and logos relating thereto from the Assets. Because damages would be an
inadequate remedy, the Parties agree that Seller shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach by Buyer
of this Section 8.6.

8.7 Records. Within a reasonable period of time following the Closing, Seller
shall make all Records available for delivery to Buyer in Houston, Texas.
Buyer agrees to maintain the Records that are acquired pursuant to this
Agreement until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such
longer period of time as Seller shall advise Buyer is necessary in order to
have Records available with respect to open years for tax audit purposes), or,
if any of such Records pertain to any claim or dispute pending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain 

any of such Records designated by Seller until such claim or dispute is
finally resolved and the time for all appeals has been exhausted. Buyer shall
provide Seller and its representatives reasonable access to and the right to
copy such Records for the purposes of (i) preparing and delivering any
accounting provided for under this Agreement and adjusting, prorating and
settling the charges and credits provided for in this Agreement, (ii)
complying with any Law affecting Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) preparing any audit of the books and records of any third
party relating to Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date,
or responding to any audit prepared by such third parties, (iv) preparing Tax
Returns, (v) responding to or disputing any tax audit or (vi) asserting,
defending or otherwise dealing with any claim or dispute under this Agreement
or with respect to the Assets. In no event shall Buyer destroy any Records
without giving Seller sixty (60) days' advance written notice thereof and the
opportunity, at Seller's expense, to obtain such Records prior to their
destruction.

8.8 Amendment of Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to (but only with
respect to) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall have the continuing right until the Closing to add,
supplement or amend all schedules hereto to its representations and warranties
with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
schedules; provided that, Seller may not add, supplement or amend any such
schedules to make any change arising out of any breach by Seller of this
Agreement. For purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 9.2(a) have been fulfilled, the schedules to Seller's representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only
that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be
deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition, supplement or
amendment thereto.

8.9 Recording. Immediately following the Closing, Buyer, at its cost and
expense, shall record the Conveyance and all other instruments of assignment
in the appropriate governmental offices of the jurisdictions in which the
Assets are located and in any other locations and records in which recordation
is required or advisable. Promptly following such recording, Buyer shall
advise Seller in writing of the pertinent recording data.

8.10 Casualty and Condemnation. If after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing any part of the Assets shall be destroyed or damaged by fire or
other casualty or if any part of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or
under the right of eminent domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be
pending or threatened, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding any such destruction, damage, taking or proceeding or the
threat thereof. To the extent insurance proceeds, condemnation awards or other
payments are not committed, used or applied by Seller prior to the Closing
Date to repair, restore or replace such destroyed, damaged or taken Assets,
Seller shall at the Closing (a) assign to Buyer Seller's right to receive all
insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or payments owed to Seller by
reason of such destruction or taking, less any reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by Seller in collecting same or in connection with such proceedings
or the threat thereof, and (b) pay to Buyer all insurance or condemnation
proceeds, awards or payments theretofore paid to Seller by reason of such
destruction, damage or taking, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by Seller in collecting same or in connection with such proceedings or the
threat thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any insurance or 

condemnation proceeds, awards or payments (or any rights thereto) by reason of
such destruction, damage or taking which are held by or owed to Seller for the
account or benefit of any third party joint interest owners shall not be paid
or assigned by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.10 and shall instead
be transferred to the successor operator or other Person responsible therefor
pursuant to the terms of the applicable operating or other agreement. In the
event (i) any condemnation action results in a condemnation payment in an
amount less than the allocated value of the affected Asset, or (ii) any
casualty event or condemnation action results in the loss or destruction of
personal property or equipment without compensation for the reasonable
replacement cost thereof, then in any such event the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward at Closing in the amount of the deficiency.

8.11 Operations. Seller agrees to execute and deliver to Buyer, at Closing,
change of operator forms as required by the applicable Governmental
Authorities and to recommend Buyer as successor operator (i) of each well
currently operated by a Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, to the extent
permitted under any applicable joint operating agreement, and (ii) under each
forced pooling order pursuant to which Seller or an Affiliate of Seller has
been designated as unit operator.

8.12 Revenues in Suspense. At the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer (by
adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.1) all revenues then
held in suspense by Seller and relating to the Assets, together with a current
suspense register detailing the suspense accounts. Buyer agrees to pay when
due to the owners thereof, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, all
suspense revenues so delivered by Seller and to indemnify and hold harmless
Seller with respect to the payment thereof up to but not exceeding the amount
delivered by Seller.

8.13 Certain Invoices. From and after the Closing Date until the first
anniversary thereof, Seller agrees to pay any unpaid invoice received by it or
by Buyer for services rendered and/or goods and materials delivered to or for
the benefit of Seller with respect to the exploration, construction,
ownership, maintenance or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that such obligation exists irrespective of the
fact that the costs and expenses reflected in such invoices were incurred
pursuant to liens, encumbrances or contracts that constitute Permitted
Encumbrances.

8.14 Settlement of Pending Action. Seller will not compromise or settle the
Action listed on Schedule 4.1(e), except to the extent such compromise or
settlement is for the payment of money for time periods before the Effective
Time, without the consent of Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer will not compromise or settle the
Action listed on Schedule 4.1(e), except to the extent such compromise or
settlement is for the payment of money for time periods after the Effective
Time, without the consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

BREACHING PARTY OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH BY THE
BREACHING PARTY OF ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may, however, include
indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages to the extent
(i) the injuries or losses resulting 

in or giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by a Person which
is not a Seller Indemnified Person, a Buyer Indemnified Person or an Affiliate
of any of the foregoing and (ii) such damages are recovered against an
Indemnified Person by a Person which is not a Seller Indemnified Person, a
Buyer Indemnified Person or an Affiliate of any of the foregoing. This Section
12.3 shall operate only to limit a Party's liability and shall not operate to
increase or expand any contractual obligation of a Party hereunder or cause
any contractual obligation of a Party hereunder to survive longer than
provided in Section 11.3.

ARTICLE XIII 
ASSUMPTION AND INDEMNIFICATION

13.1 Assumption and Indemnification By Buyer. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall assume, pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all Assumed
Liabilities and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, Seller's Affiliates,
each of Seller's and its Affiliates' respective past, present and future
directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents, and each of the
directors, officers, heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all (a) Assumed Liabilities incurred by or asserted against
any of the Seller Indemnified Persons, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
ASSUMED LIABILITY BASED ON NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF
ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR ON ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
LAW (WHETHER COMMON OR STATUTORY) OR EQUITY and (b) subject to the limitations
of Section 11.3 and Article XII, any Covered Liability resulting from any
breach or nonfulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer which is expressly set forth in this Agreement.

13.2 Indemnification By Seller. Subject to the provisions of Sections 11.3 and
13.4 and Article XII, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates, each of Buyer's and its Affiliates'

agents, and each of the directors, officers, heirs, executors, successors and
permitted assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Covered Liabilities
resulting from (a) any breach or nonfulfillment of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller which is expressly set
forth in this Agreement and (b) resolution of the lawsuit described in
Schedule 4.1(e) to the extent such resolution results in the obligation of
Seller, any Seller Indemnified Person, predecessors in interest, or Buyer to
pay amounts which are attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time, as
well as all attorney fees and costs incurred by Seller related to the lawsuit
attributable to periods prior to or after the Effective Time.

13.3 Indemnification and Defense Procedures. A Person which is entitled to be
indemnified under Section 5.1, 13.1 or 13.2 is herein referred to as an
"Indemnified Person" and the Party which is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Person under Section 5.1, 13.1 or 13.2 is herein referred to as
the "Indemnifying Party" with respect to the matter for which it is obligated
to indemnify such Indemnified Person. All claims for indemnification under
Sections 5.1, 13.1 and 13.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

(a) If a third-party claim for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2 (an "Indemnified Claim") is
made against an Indemnified Person, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto by or from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, then the Party electing to seek indemnity on
behalf of such Indemnified Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice ("Claim Notice") (i) notifying such Indemnifying Party
of such Indemnified Claim and requesting indemnity on behalf of such
Indemnified Person with respect to such Indemnified Claim under Sections 5.1,
13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be, (ii) setting forth the full name,
address for all notices and the authorized representatives of such Indemnified
Person with respect to such Indemnified Claim, and (iii) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Indemnified Claim, including a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Indemnified Claim (if any) and the basis of
such request for indemnification under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the
case may be. Failure to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not affect
the right of the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby; provided that, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or otherwise
hold harmless an Indemnified Person with respect to a third-party claim until
a Claim Notice meeting the foregoing requirements is furnished to the
Indemnifying Party by the Party seeking indemnity hereunder. Within thirty
(30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the "Election Period") from a
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice
(A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the
case may be, with respect to such third-party claim and (B) whether the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Person against such
third-party claim; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party fails to so notify
the Party who sent the Claim Notice during the Election Period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected to dispute such liability
and not to defend against such third-party claim.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Party who sent the Claim Notice
within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 13.1
and/or 13.2, as the case may be, and (ii) elects to assume the defense of such
Indemnified Person with respect to such third-party claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
expense, such third-party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 13.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third-party claim
in a manner) which provides for or results in any payment by or liability of
the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other amount, any lien, charge
or encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified Person, any finding of
responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Person or any
sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified
Person without the Indemnified Person's express written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Person is hereby
authorized, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only
if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder),
to file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings
which the Indemnified Person shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect
its interests or those of the 

Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected to be prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any such
third-party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including
the making of any related counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person
(other than a Buyer Indemnified Person, if the Indemnified Person is a Buyer
Indemnified Person, or a Seller Indemnified Person, if the Indemnified Person
is a Seller Indemnified Person). The Indemnified Person may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement of any third-party claim controlled
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.3(b), and the
Indemnified Person shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. The prosecution of the defense of a third-party claim with
reasonable diligence shall include the taking of such action (including the
posting of a bond, deposit or other security) as may be necessary to prevent
any action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the
Indemnified Person for payment of such third-party claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to notify the Party who sent the Claim
Notice within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) or (ii) elects to defend
the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) but fails to prosecute the
defense of (or to settle) the third-party claim with reasonable diligence,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), the third-party claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly and vigorously
prosecuted by the Indemnified Person to a final conclusion or settled. The
Indemnified Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Person may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such third-party claim, without the Indemnifying
Party's express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section 13.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) If an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under Sections 5.1, 13.1
and/or 13.2 for a claim or other matter which does not involve a third-party
claim, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek indemnity for itself or on
behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect thereto by or from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, then the Party
electing to seek indemnity on behalf of itself or an Indemnified Person shall
promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice describing in
reasonable detail the nature of such claim or other matter, the Indemnified
Person's reasonable estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such
claim or other matter and the basis for the Indemnified Person's entitlement
to indemnification under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Party who sent such notice
within thirty (30) days from its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party does not dispute such claim for indemnity, the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have disputed such claim.

13.4 Seller's General Liability Limitation.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement: 

(i) In no event shall Seller's aggregate liability arising out of or relating
to Section 13.2 with respect to a breach by Seller of any representation or
warranty made by Seller in this Agreement exceed an amount equal to twenty
percent (20%) of the Purchase Price;

(ii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 13.2
with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement unless the aggregate amount which would otherwise be payable by
Seller thereunder with respect to all breaches of any such representations and
warranties exceeds an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Deductible Amount"), and in such event, Seller shall be
responsible for only the amount in excess of the Deductible Amount; and

(iii) After the Closing, for purposes of the indemnification obligation set
forth in Section 13.2, the knowledge qualification set forth in Section
4.1(k)(i) shall be disregarded.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary but without in
any way affecting the obligations of a Buyer Indemnified Person to notify
Seller of a third-party claim pursuant to Section 13.3, Seller shall not have
any liability to any Person with respect to any Covered Liability pursuant to
Section 13.2 unless and until Buyer enforces any and all of the rights and
remedies that Buyer may have with respect to such Covered Liability against
any other Person pursuant to (i) any insurance maintained for the joint
account under any operating agreement with respect to the Assets and (ii) any
other agreements for insurance, indemnification, guarantee or similar
assurances which may be included in the Assets.

13.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 8.6, Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing Date, the
indemnification provisions of this Article XIII are the sole and exclusive
remedy of Seller and Buyer for the breach of any representation or warranty or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or Buyer
under this Agreement or confirmed in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, and Seller does hereby release, acquit and forever discharge all Buyer
Indemnified Persons and Buyer does hereby release, acquit, and forever
discharge all Seller Indemnified Persons from any such other remedies.

ARTICLE XIV 
TERMINATION; REMEDIES

14.1 Termination.

(a) Termination of Agreement. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

(i) By the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; or

(ii) If the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the
Closing Date (the "Termination Effective Time"), then (A) by Seller if any
condition specified in 

Section 9.1 has not been satisfied on or before the Termination Effective
Time, and shall not theretofore have been waived by Seller, or (B) by Buyer if
any condition specified in Section 9.2 has not been satisfied on or before the
Termination Effective Time, and shall not theretofore have been waived by
Buyer; provided, in each case, that the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or before such time did not result from the failure by
the Party seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill any undertaking or
commitment provided for herein on the part of such Party that is required to
be fulfilled on or prior to Closing.

(b) Effect of Termination. Without limiting Seller's or Buyer's respective
remedies and rights in regard to the Deposit under Section 14.2, in the event
of termination of this Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, pursuant to Section 14.1(a), written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party, and this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate; provided, however, that the last sentence
of Section 8.2 shall survive such termination and Buyer will continue to be
bound by its obligations set forth in Article V following such termination. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and
other submissions made to any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority to which they were
made.

14.2 Remedies.

(e) Seller's Remedies. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is not terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
14.1(a)(ii)(B) and the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.1(a),
9.1(b) or 9.1(c) are not satisfied, Seller may, at its sole option, either (i)
enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this
Agreement and, without waiving or releasing Buyer's obligations under Sections
5.1 and 5.2, retain the Deposit, including any interest and other amounts
earned thereon, as liquidated damages. Such remedies shall be Seller's sole
and exclusive remedies for such failure, all other remedies being expressly
waived by Seller. Seller and Buyer agree upon the Deposit as liquidated
damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience of measuring actual damages
and the uncertainty thereof, and Seller and Buyer agree that such amount is a
reasonable estimate of Seller's loss in the event of any such failure by
Buyer. Without waiving or releasing Buyer from any of its other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
specific performance with respect to clause (ii)(b) of Section 10.3 shall not
require Buyer to make a false statement in the officer's certificate of Buyer.
If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 14.1(a)(ii)(A)
and the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1(a), 9.1(b) and 9.1(c) have been
satisfied, Seller's sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement, in which
case Buyer shall receive back the Deposit.

(f) Buyer's Remedies. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is not terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
14.1(a)(ii)(A) and the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.2(a),
9.2(b) or 9.2(c) are not satisfied, Buyer may, at its sole option, either (i)
enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this
Agreement and receive back the Deposit, together with interest thereon from
the date of this Agreement to the date repayment is made by Seller to Buyer at
the Agreed Rate. Such remedies shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies
for such failure, all other remedies being expressly waived by Buyer. Without
waiving 

or releasing Seller from any of its other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, specific performance with respect
to Section 10.2(b) shall not require Seller to make a false statement in the
officer's certificate of Seller. If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 14.1(a)(ii)(B) and the conditions set forth in Sections
9.2(a), 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) have been satisfied, Buyer's sole remedy shall be to
terminate this Agreement, in which case Buyer shall receive back the Deposit.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by mutual written consent of Seller
and Buyer pursuant to Section 14.1(a)(i), then Buyer shall be entitled to
receive back the Deposit.

(c) Dispute Resolution. In the event of a dispute between Seller and Buyer
with respect to entitlement to the Deposit, then either Party may by written
notice to the other refer such dispute for resolution by binding arbitration
pursuant to and in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures, reasonably
modified by agreement of the Parties acting in good faith to define the
"Disputed Issues" as entitlement to the Deposit and eliminating all references
to Deferred Adjustment Claims.

ARTICLE XV 
MISCELLANEOUS

out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the
Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction
other than the above specified courts; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in

Law, that a final and unappealable judgment against a Party in any action or
proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the

and amount of such judgment. Except to the extent that a different
determination or finding is mandated due to the applicable law being that of a
different jurisdiction, the Parties agree that all judicial determinations or
findings by a state or federal court in Houston, Texas with respect to any

benefit of Buyer, Seller and their respective successors and assigns as

contained herein, receive any rights hereunder or be a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement. Any Indemnified Person which is a third Person shall be

Section 13.3; and no Party shall have any direct liability or obligation to
any third Person or be liable to any third Person for any election or non-

15.12 Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing Party in any legal proceeding brought
under or to enforce this Agreement shall be additionally entitled to recover

15.13 Severability. If any term, provision or condition of this Agreement, or
any application thereof, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect under any Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent
necessary to conform, in each case consistent with the intention of the
Parties, to such Law, and to the extent such term, provision or condition
cannot be so reformed, then such term, provision or condition (or such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed deleted
from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining terms, provisions and
conditions contained herein (and any other application such term, provision or
condition) shall not in any way be affected 

or impaired thereby. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

15.14 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

15.15 Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer and Seller consent to any assignment by the
other Party of certain of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (a
"1031 Assignment") to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in
Section 1.1031(k)‑1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations), or to a Qualified
Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in Rev. Proc.
2000‑37), in connection with effectuation of a like-kind exchange (an
"Exchange"). For the purposes of this Section 15.15, the Party executing an
Exchange shall be referred to as the "Exchangor" and the other Party shall be
referred to as the "Consenting Party". In the event the Exchangor makes a 1031
Assignment to a Qualified Intermediary or a Qualified Exchange Accommodation
Titleholder pursuant to this Section 15.15, the Exchangor agrees to notify the
Consenting Party in writing of such assignment at least one (1) Business Day
before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the occurrence of a 1031 Assignment,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that any such assignment of any portion of
the Exchangor's rights and obligations under this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary or to a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder, does not
release either Party from any of their respective liabilities and obligations
to each other (including, without limitation, indemnification obligations)
under this Agreement. The Consenting Party agrees to cooperate with the
Exchangor to attempt to structure the transactions contemplated hereby as a
like-kind exchange; provided (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected
by reason of the Exchange, and (ii) the Exchangor shall indemnify the
Consenting Party against any additional costs or liabilities directly incurred
by the Consenting Party on account of the Exchangor's consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby through an Exchange.

| 
---|---

Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to such terms in the Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

(a) With respect to unresolved Deferred Adjustment Claims, on or before the
Deferred Matters Date, Seller and Buyer shall each submit to the other the
list of what such Party considers to comprise the remaining unresolved
Deferred Adjustment Claims. The two lists shall together comprise the
"Disputed Issues" relating to Deferred Adjustment Claims which shall be
resolved by the binding arbitration provided for herein. 

(b) If, pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Agreement, either Buyer or Seller elect
to submit any Final Adjustment Statement disagreements to arbitration, such
disagreements will also constitute "Disputed Issues" to be resolved by the
binding arbitration provided for herein.

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Seller and Buyer, each being duly authorized by all necessary corporate,
limited partnership or other proceedings, shall submit the Disputed Issues to
binding arbitration by a board of arbitration to be selected by the following
procedures. Notices hereunder shall be sufficient if sent in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement. With respect to Disputed Issues involving Deferred
Adjustment Claims, within five (5) days after the Deferred Matters Date,
Seller shall by written notice to Buyer name one arbitrator and Buyer shall by
written notice to Seller name one arbitrator. With respect to Disputed Issues
involving Final Adjustment Statement disagreements, within five (5) days after
either Buyer or Seller provides the other Party with written notice that such
Party desires to submit such Final Adjustment Statement disagreements to
arbitration, Seller shall by written notice to Buyer name one arbitrator and
Buyer shall by written notice to Seller name one arbitrator. If a Party fails
to name an arbitrator, the other Party shall by further written notice to the
other Party name the second arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed shall
name the third arbitrator within ten (10) days after the selection of the
second arbitrator. If they fail to do so, either arbitrator may request the
judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas
having greatest tenure, but not yet on retired or senior status, to appoint
the third arbitrator. If that judge fails to do so within thirty (30) days,
either Party may request the judge of that court next senior to name the third
arbitrator, and if that judge fails to do so after ten (10) days, either Party
may make the request of the judge of that court next senior, and so on, until
the 

 

Exhibit A-1, Page 1

* * *





board of arbitration is constituted. Each arbitrator must be experienced in
and knowledgeable about the oil and gas exploration and production business
and, to the extent the Disputed Issues relate to accounting, must be
experienced in and knowledgeable about oil and gas accounting matters. In
addition, the third arbitrator, in each case, shall be required to meet the
qualification requirements of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"), whether appointed by the
arbitrators or by a judge as provided above.



| 
---|--- 

4.

|

If prior to rendering a decision an arbitrator resigns or becomes unable to
serve, the arbitrator shall be replaced as follows. If that arbitrator was one
of the two arbitrators appointed by a Party, the Party that named him or her
shall name a replacement; provided, however, that if that replacement is not
named within five (5) days from notice of resignation or inability to serve,
the other Party shall name a replacement. If he or she was the third
arbitrator, the other two arbitrators shall name a replacement; provided,
however, that if they fail to agree on a replacement within ten (10) days,
either arbitrator may follow the procedures specified in Paragraph 3 above and
request judicial appoint of the replacement. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

No Party subject to these Arbitration Procedures will commence or prosecute
any suit or action against the other Party subject to these Arbitration
Procedures relating to the Disputed Issues, other than as may be necessary to
compel arbitration under these Arbitration Procedures or to enforce the award
of the board of arbitration. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

The board of arbitration may in all matters act through a majority of its
members on each matter if unanimity is not attained. It shall not be necessary
that the same majority agree on each and every item; that is, the Parties will
be bound by majority rulings on each Disputed Issue even though the majority
is not the same as to each Disputed Issue. In fulfilling their duties
hereunder with respect to Deferred Adjustment Claims, each of the arbitrators
shall be bound by the matters set forth in Article VI of the Agreement. The
arbitrators shall not add any interest factor reflecting the time value of
money to any Title Defect Amount. 

|

7.

|

No matters whatsoever, other than the Disputed Issues, are subject to the
agreement to arbitrate embodied in these Arbitration Procedures. The board of
arbitration shall be empowered hereunder solely to resolve the Disputed
Issues. The board of arbitration shall not have any authority to award
indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages. The sole forum for the
arbitration shall be Harris County, Texas and all hearings shall be conducted
in Harris County, Texas. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

The decision of the board of arbitration shall be rendered in writing and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties as to the Disputed Issues. The
expenses of arbitration, including reasonable compensation to the third
arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the Parties. Each Party shall bear the
compensation and expenses of its own counsel, witnesses and employees and of
any arbitrator it has appointed. If the testimony of a witness is obtained by
both Parties, the costs associated with obtaining such testimony shall be
borne equally between the Parties.
