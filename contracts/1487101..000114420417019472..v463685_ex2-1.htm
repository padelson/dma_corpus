&ldquo;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&rdquo;) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is reasonably
likely to be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice will not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is
otherwise prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail, will include copies of all material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying

in good faith and shall not settle any such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Third-Party Claim includes allegations for which the Indemnifying
Party both would and would not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may, in that case, jointly
assume the defense thereof with the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;7.05(b)</U>, it will have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party
Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s right
to control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim or fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
may, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;7.05(b)</U>, pay, compromise, and defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim, including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period following notice of such Third-Party Claim during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and Parent will cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available
records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses)
to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.</P>

Affiliates; therefore (i)&nbsp;irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its terms and, (ii) although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and undertakings, monetary
damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, subject to <U>Section 9.11(c)</U>, each party agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, that if the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, breaches or threatens
to breach any provision of this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain such breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide, furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such order or injunction,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other

each party waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. The rights in this <U>Section 9.11</U> are in addition
to any other remedy to which a party may be entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations herein), and the exercise
by a party of one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.</P>
