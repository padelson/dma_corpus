time as the parties may agree in writing and as is provided in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with and as permitted by the DGCL (such
time that the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the DGCL
and, without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the

liabilities, obligations, debts, restrictions, duties and penalties, of the
Company and Merger Sub.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of

Section 2.07 _Conversion of Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock then issued
and outstanding (other than (i) the shares of Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)_ and (ii) the Appraisal Shares, which
shall only have those rights set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ ) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub, the holders of such shares of Common Stock or any other
Person, (x) be automatically converted into, and thereafter only evidence, the
right to receive the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payable as
provided in this Agreement and (y) no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that are held by any holder that (i) is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_
") pursuant to Section 262, (ii) complies in all respects with Section 262
and (iii) has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holder's right to
such appraisal, shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.07(a)_. At
the Effective Time each such share of Common Stock shall automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall be
entitled to only such rights granted to such holder under Section 262. If any
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise effectively waives, withdraws or
loses such holder's rights under Section 262, each of such holder's Appraisal
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall thereafter only evidence, the right to receive the Aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.07(a)_ , without
interest, following the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal and surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Appraisal Shares. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
amend or waive any obligation of any holder of Common Stock who has waived or
limited the right to assert dissenters' rights in a separate Contract.

  



  

(c) The Company shall provide notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in
respect of the Appraisal Shares. Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), voluntarily make any payment to any holder of shares of Common
Stock with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent
shall be entitled to retain any portion of the Merger Consideration not paid
on account of such Appraisal Shares pending resolution of the claims of
holders of Appraisal Shares, and the other Securityholders shall not be
entitled to any portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time,

  



  

(i) each share of Common Stock held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

  



  

(ii) each share of Common Stock held by Merger Sub, Parent, or any
parent entity or Subsidiary of Merger Sub or Parent shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.08 _Company Stock Options_. Parent shall not assume or
otherwise be required to replace any Options, whether vested or unvested, in
connection with the Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof administering the Stock Option Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to (w)
terminate the Stock Option Plan as of or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (x) ensure that except as provided in this _Section 2.08_, as of the
Effective Time, no holder of any award granted under the Stock Option Plan
shall have any right thereunder to acquire any Equity Securities of the
Company or to receive any payment or benefit with respect thereto, and (y)
provide that at the Effective Time, without any further action on the part of
any holder of any Option, each vested Participating Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
terminate, be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the
right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in respect of
each share of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such vested
Participating Option, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, _minus_
(ii) the exercise price applicable to such share of Common Stock, subject to
any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with _Section 2.10_.

  



  

Section 2.09 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and thereafter evidence one fully paid and nonassessable Surviving
Corporation Common Share with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding Equity
Securities of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub capital stock shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of Surviving Corporation
Common Shares into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Withholding_. No withholding with respect to any
holder of Common Stock shall be required at Closing if (a) such holder shall
have delivered to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective agents a complete
IRS Form W-8 or W-9 and (b) the Company has delivered to Parent or Merger Sub
the certificate described in _Section 5.10(b)_. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, the Surviving Corporation (or its designated payroll agent) shall
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to the holders of Options or the holders of Common Stock such
amounts as it or any of its Subsidiaries is required to deduct and withhold
under any applicable Tax Law. All amounts withheld and paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time there is any change in the
outstanding Equity Securities of the Company as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the amounts payable under this Agreement in
respect of the shares of Common Stock and the Options shall be proportionately
adjusted to account for such change.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Letter of Transmittal_. On or promptly following the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide a Letter of Transmittal to each holder of
record of shares of Common Stock.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Payment for Shares of Common Stock_. After the Effective Time,
upon surrender of any Certificate to Parent, together with a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of the
shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate and relating to such
Letter of Transmittal shall be entitled to promptly receive from Parent in
exchange therefor (and in no event more than two Business Days thereafter),
(i) if prior to the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount,
an amount in cash equal to (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, _multiplied by_ (B) the Closing Per Share
Merger Consideration, and (ii) if following the final determination of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, an amount in cash equal to (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate, _multiplied
by_  (B) the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration then payable, in each
case for such shares of Common Stock. If a transfer of ownership of any
shares of Common Stock occurs that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, Parent shall pay the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration
or the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of
Common Stock to the transferee if such transferee presents the applicable
Certificate and Letter of Transmittal properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and such other documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and reasonable evidence that any applicable
stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

  



  

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, and the holder of the shares of Common Stock
represented thereby (i) makes an affidavit of that fact and (ii) if required
by Parent, executes an indemnification agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Company shall issue in exchange for each
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, a replacement Certificate or in lieu
thereof, Parent shall pay the amounts that would otherwise be payable in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Liability for Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, any Affiliate of the foregoing or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, Closing Per Option Merger
Consideration, Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Stock or Options two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date, prior to such time, as of which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any Lien.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. The
applicable portion of Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II _shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Common Stock, other than the right to receive all
applicable post-Closing amounts payable under this Agreement. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided for in  _Section 2.07_ and
_Section 2.12_.

Section 2.16 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any case no later than 60
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
prepare and deliver to the Stockholders' Representative a written statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Surviving Corporation's good
faith calculation of (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Working Capital, (iii)
Closing Indebtedness, (iv) Transaction Expenses and (v) Company Tax Benefits,
together with such schedules and data with respect to the determination of
the foregoing as may be appropriate to support the calculations set forth in
the Closing Statement. The foregoing items shall be calculated by the
Surviving Corporation in a manner consistent with the form, methodologies,
estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used to prepare the
Estimated Closing Statement ( _provided_ that such methodologies, estimation
techniques, assumptions and principles must be in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with those used in the Financial Statements). Following delivery
of the Closing Statement and until the Closing Statement has become final and
binding as set forth in this _Section 2.16_ , Parent shall provide to the
Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives, on reasonable advance
notice and during regular business hours, reasonable access to relevant
information, personnel and properties of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as well as to any documents or work papers used in the
preparation of the Closing Statement, in each case, as the Stockholders'
Representative may reasonably request in connection with its review of the
Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) If the Stockholders' Representative disagrees with the Closing
Statement or the calculations of the amounts set forth therein, the
Stockholders' Representative may, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing
Statement, deliver written notice to Parent (such notice, a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the reason for such disagreement
and alternative calculations with respect to the items or amounts with which
it disagrees (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "). Any item or amount not objected
to in the Dispute Notice (an " _Undisputed Item_ ") shall become final and
binding on the parties for purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent
that an adjustment to a Disputed Item made in accordance with this  _Section
2.16_ requires an offsetting adjustment to be made to an Undisputed Item. If
the Stockholders' Representative fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Parent
within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement to the Stockholders'
Representative, or if the Stockholders' Representative notifies Parent in
writing that it will not deliver a Dispute Notice, then the Closing Statement
in its entirety shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative delivers a Dispute Notice,
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve each Disputed Item set forth therein, and any resolution agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative with respect to each
Disputed Item shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement. If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative are able to resolve
all of the Disputed Items, then the Closing Statement, adjusted to reflect
such resolution of all Disputed Items, shall be final and binding on the
parties for purposes of this Agreement. If Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative are unable to resolve all Disputed Items within 20 days after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, then either Parent or the Stockholders'
Representative may refer the unresolved Disputed Items to the
Accounting Arbitrator for final determination.

  



  

(d) Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall each have the
opportunity to provide written submissions regarding their positions on the
unresolved Disputed Items; _provided_ that such written submissions are
delivered to the Accounting Arbitrator, if at all, no later than 20 days
after the date the unresolved Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting
Arbitrator. Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall make available
to the Accounting Arbitrator the relevant information in their possession and
relevant personnel and properties of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as well as any documents or work papers used in the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice, and all other items in their
possession reasonably requested by the Accounting Arbitrator, and shall
provide copies of all of the foregoing to each other.

(e) The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only (i) those Disputed
Items submitted to it for resolution and (ii) any Undisputed Items or
Disputed Items previously resolved between Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative that require an offsetting adjustment to be made in connection
with the resolution of such Disputed Items. In resolving each such Disputed
Item, the Accounting Arbitrator (i) shall resolve such Disputed Item in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) shall make its
determination based solely on the presentations and supporting material
provided by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative and not pursuant to
any independent review and (iii) may not assign a value to any item (A)
_greater than_ the greatest value for such item claimed by either Parent or
the Stockholders' Representative or (B) _less than_ the smallest value
for such item claimed by either Parent or the Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(f) The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event
shall endeavor to do so within 30 days after its appointment, a written report
(i) setting forth (x) the resolution of each Disputed Item submitted to it
and (y) any adjustments that are required to be made to any Undisputed Items
or Disputed Items previously resolved between Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative to reflect such resolution and (ii) containing a revised
Closing Statement reflecting the foregoing (the " _Arbitrator 's Report_").
The Arbitrator's Report and the revised Closing Statement contained therein
shall be final and binding upon the parties for purposes of this
Agreement and shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable.

  



  

(g) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be borne by (i) Parent in the proportion that (A) the aggregate dollar amount
of the Disputed Items that are resolved in favor of the Stockholders'
Representative bears to (B) the aggregate dollar amount of the Disputed Items
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator and (ii) the Stockholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) in the proportion that (A)
the aggregate dollar amount of the Disputed Items that are resolved in
favor of Parent bears to (B) the aggregate dollar amount of the Disputed
Items submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator, in each case, as finally
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

  



  

(h) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number or
zero, then, within two Business Days after final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount, (i) Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Escrow Account to the Stockholders' Representative an aggregate amount
equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, and (ii) Parent shall
pay the Stockholders' Representative an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by the Stockholders'
Representative and for distribution by the Stockholders' Representative in
accordance with _Section 2.16(j)_.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
then, within two Business Days after final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall
deliver a Joint Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Escrow Account (i) to Parent, the lesser of (A) the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount and (B) the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, and (ii) to the Stockholders'
Representative, any remaining amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount following the payment to Parent made pursuant to clause (i),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in writing by the Stockholders' Representative and for distribution
by the Stockholders' Representative in accordance with _Section 2.16(j)_. If
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount payable to Parent exceeds the
Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, Parent shall, in addition to its
rights to receive the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, be entitled to receive the amount of such
excess as a distribution from the General Indemnity Holdback Amount, and
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction
instructing the Escrow Agent to release such excess amount from the Escrow
Account to Parent.

  



  

(j) Promptly following receipt by the Stockholders' Representative
of the Net Adjustment Amount, the Stockholders' Representative shall pay:

of shares of Common Stock held by such Direct Payment Holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the Net Per Share Adjustment

Common Stock held by the Direct Payment Holders and shares of Common Stock
to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.07(d)_ ), _plus_ (2) the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Participating
Options, _multiplied by_ (B) the Net Per Share Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(k) As soon as practicable after Parent's receipt of the amounts
paid to it pursuant to _Section 2.16(j)(ii)_ , Parent shall deliver to each
holder of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time who has delivered a Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with _Section 2.12_ (other than the Direct Payment Holders referenced in
_Section 2.16(j)(i)_ ), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock held by such holder, _multiplied
by_ (ii) the Net Per Share Adjustment Amount, subject to any applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with _Section 2.10_.

  



  

(l) As soon as practicable after Parent's receipt of the amounts
paid to it pursuant to _Section 2.16(j)(ii)_ , Parent shall deliver to each

Section 4.08 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.02(a)_ and _6.02(b)_ , and that the Financing (or
Alternate Financing) is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter,
at the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall have funds sufficient to
enable Parent and Merger Sub to pay the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration
and the other amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ , to consummate the
Transactions, to refinance any indebtedness required to be refinanced in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and to pay related fees
and expenses. Parent has delivered to the Company an accurate and complete
copy of (i) a fully executed debt commitment letter (together with all
annexes, schedules, supplements, term sheets exhibits and other agreements
thereto, collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the financial
institutions party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") together with
the executed fee letter related thereto of even date therewith (which fee
letter may be redacted to cover economic terms, so long as no such redaction
covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate principal amount,
conditionality, enforceability, availability or termination of the debt
financing contemplated therein), pursuant to the terms, but subject to the
conditions expressly set forth therein, of which certain of the Lenders
have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein for purposes of partially financing the
Transactions (such debt financing, the " _Financing_ ").

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is (x) a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent (to the extent party
thereto) and Merger Sub (to the extent party thereto) and, to the knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, in accordance with their respective
terms, (y) enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent (to the
extent party thereto) and Merger Sub (to the extent party thereto) and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and (z) in full force and
effect, except, in each case, as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable Bankruptcy Laws and Principles of Equity. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are not, and there are not contemplated to be, any side
letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Commitment
Letter other than as expressly contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
fee letter delivered to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
and the commitments and obligations contained therein have not been
withdrawn, modified, terminated or rescinded in any respect,
amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived (and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no such withdrawal, modification, termination, amendment, restatement
or waiver is contemplated (other than as set forth in the fee letters with
regard to flex rights or to add additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement)). As of the date of
this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, there are no
facts or circumstances that could result in Parent, Merger Sub or any other
party to the Debt Commitment Letter not being able to satisfy on a timely
basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by such party,
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in a default or breach on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, or to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto,
under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees payable under the Debt
Commitment Letter (or fee letter related thereto) that are payable on or prior
to the date hereof, and will pay in full any such additional amounts payable
under the Debt Commitment Letter (or fee letter related thereto) on or before
the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions
precedent or contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in
the form delivered to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and such Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent and contingencies to the obligations of the parties thereunder to
make the Financing available to Parent and Merger Sub.

influence" as defined at §2-300(a) of the NISPOM, and is not a "foreign

entry, enactment or promulgation thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Affiliates be obligated to commit to take any action pursuant to _Section
5.03_,  _Section 5.04_ or this _Section 5.05_ , the consummation of which or
effectiveness thereof is not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing,

any listing agreement with or listing rules of a securities exchange.

any provision in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
equivalent governing documents of any of them relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any DandO
Indemnified Person with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time and (ii) all DandO Indemnified Persons shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and no change, modification or
amendment of such documents or arrangements shall be made that could
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person's right thereto without the prior
written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for, at Parent's expense, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
ratings as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to
officers' and directors' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") for the Persons who are covered
by the existing DandO Insurance of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, with
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage (including as coverage
relates to deductibles and exclusions) at least as favorable as the
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters arising out of or relating to
acts or omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or
existed) at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the
Transaction Agreements and the Transactions);  _provided_ that one-half of
the cost of the DandO Insurance shall be deemed to be a Transaction Expense.
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, cancel or
change the DandO Insurance.

  



  

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys 50% or more of its
properties and other assets to any Person (including by liquidation,
dissolution or assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action),
then in each such case Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.08_.

  



  

(d) Except for DandO Losses and DandO Expenses to the extent actually
covered by the DandO Insurance, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be a full indemnitor of first resort, shall be required to advance the
full amount of all DandO Expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified Person and
shall be liable for the full amount of all DandO Losses to the extent required,
without regard to any rights a DandO Indemnified Person may have against (i)
any insurer providing insurance coverage under an insurance policy (other
than the DandO Insurance) issued to, or covering, such Person or (ii) any other
Persons.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights and
benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.08_ shall not
be terminated or modified in any manner adverse to any DandO Indemnified Person
without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person. The
provisions of this _Section 5.08_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and
his or her executors, administrators and personal representatives, each of
whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.08_ , and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights, including
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ shall survive
the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 5.09 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, to the extent commercially
practicable, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each continuing employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries with base
salary or hourly wage and benefits, comparable in the aggregate to those that
he or she was eligible to receive immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual (other
than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree
medical plan) and entitlement to benefits, including the determination of the
level of vacation and severance pay benefits under the benefit and
compensation plans, programs, Contracts and arrangements of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which
employees are eligible to participate following the Closing (collectively, the
" _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall credit each
employee with his or her years of service with the Company, its Subsidiaries
and any predecessor Persons, to the same extent as such employee was entitled
immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under any similar
Parent Plan, except where such crediting would result in duplication of
benefits. To the extent commercially reasonable, the Parent Plans shall not
deny employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent
such conditions were waived or satisfied under similar Plans immediately
prior to the Closing and shall credit such employees for any deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses in the applicable plan year to which
such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses relate.

  



  

(c) Upon Parent's written request with respect to one or more
specified Plans, made at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best
efforts to amend such specified Plan effective upon the Closing to exclude
all employees and other service providers of Parent and Affiliates of Parent,
other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, from eligibility and
participation in each such specified Plan, effective as of the Closing, in
each case, to the extent such amendment is permitted by applicable Law, such
Plan and any other applicable Contracts. The form and substance of such Plan
amendments shall be subject to the prior review and consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(d) All provisions contained in this _Section 5.09_ with respect to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties, and shall not create any right (i) in any
other Person or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained in this
_Section 5.09_ is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or
adoption of any plan, program, Contract, arrangement or policy of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation nor
shall it interfere with Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or any of the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or terminate any
plan, program, Contract, arrangement or policy in accordance with its
provisions (subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.09_ ) or
to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for any reason, _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.09(a)_.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but
in any event prior to the Closing Date, the Company will submit to a
stockholder vote (in a manner intended to be in compliance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code) the right of any individual who is or could
reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive payments
and benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), _provided_ that, prior to such stockholder
vote, such disqualified individual consents to waive his or her right to the
parachute payment, in a manner intended to cause the payments and benefits
that would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" to be exempt from the
definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to procure any necessary waivers from each disqualified individual
with respect to his or her rights to the parachute payments. Stockholder
approval shall be sought by the Company in a manner that satisfies all
applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury
Regulations. The form and substance of all stockholder approval documents
contemplated by this _Section 5.09(e)_ , including the waivers, shall be
subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of Parent (not to be
unreasonably delayed).

  



  

Section 5.10 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Any Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Parent when due, whether
levied on Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any holder of shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall file, or
cause to be filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall duly execute and deliver
to Parent a certificate meeting the requirements of U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), and a notice to the Internal Revenue
Service, in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
1.897-2(h)(2), dated as of the Closing Date, together with written
authorization for Parent to deliver such notice to the Internal Revenue
Service on behalf of the Company after the Closing, in each case, validly
executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

  



  

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall make any election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Preservation of Records_. For a period of seven years
after the Closing Date, Parent shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of
corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other books and
records of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (including
(i) any documents relating to any Litigation or investigations and (ii) all
Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and other material Tax records or
documents) relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date without
first offering to deliver such books and records to the
Stockholders' Representative at least 30 days prior to the date of such
proposed destruction or disposition.

this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of

Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates not to, (i) solicit, encourage, seek, initiate,
facilitate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or enter into
any Contract with, any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates) concerning (x) the purchase of any material portion of the Equity
Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) any sale of any
material portion of the consolidated assets (measured by fair market value)
of, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (whether by stock
sale, asset sale, merger or other business combination) (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "), (ii) provide any non-public information to any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives) relating to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
or (iii) consummate any reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or initial
public offering of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) shall
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations relating to or in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that are ongoing and promptly request

Person in connection with such discussions.

necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under each
Transaction Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth therein. Prior to
the Closing, Parent shall not distribute or dividend, or otherwise
transfer, any significant portion of its assets (other than cash) to any of
its direct or indirect parent entities unless, prior to any such
distribution, dividend or transfer, The KeyW Holding Corporation delivers an
executed guarantee to the Company of all of Parent's obligations hereunder,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Drag-Along Notice; Termination of Certain Contracts_.

Parent, within 20 days after the date of this Agreement, evidence that the
"Drag-Along Notice" (as such term is defined in Section 4(b) of the
Stockholders Agreement) has been delivered to the Company's stockholders who
have not consented to the principal terms of the Merger within 15 days after
of the date of this Agreement, which Drag-Along Notice shall notify such
stockholders that they are required to (a) transfer all or any portion of the
shares of Common Stock held by each such stockholder, (b) vote, or execute a
written consent with respect to, all of the shares of Common Stock held by
each such stockholder in favor of the Transactions and (c) waive any
applicable dissenters' rights, appraisal rights or similar rights which any
such stockholder may have in connection with the Transactions. At Parent's
request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce the
Stockholders Agreement to cause such stockholders to comply with their
obligations to take the foregoing actions.

terminated effective as of the Closing, without further obligations to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall deliver to Parent evidence of

Section 5.15 _Financing Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) to, use reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period) to take all actions and to do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, and obtain the proceeds
of, the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter; _provided_  that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement so long as such amendment is in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and is otherwise in accordance with
this Section 5.15(a). Parent shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment or
modification to be made to, any waiver of any provision under, or the giving
of any consent under or with respect to, or any termination of, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
supplement, modification, termination, waiver or consent:

  



  

(i) reduces or would reasonably be expected to reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount as compared to such fees and original issue
discount contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters
(including pursuant to any "flex" provisions thereof) in effect on the date
hereof) unless (A) the Financing is increased by such amount, (B) such amount
is available to be borrowed under any revolving credit facility of Parent or
(C) such amount is available through additional equity contributions and,
after giving effect thereto, the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.08 are true and correct in all material respects;

  



  

(ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of
the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case of this subsection (ii), in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay, hinder or prevent the
ability of Parent to consummate the Closing or in a manner that would cause
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur; or

  



  

(iii) would otherwise materially adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing or
otherwise to timely consummate the Transactions.

  



  

Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment,
modification or waiver to or under the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing entered into in accordance
with this Section 5.15(a).

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) to, use reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i) maintain in effect and comply with the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with its terms (as the Debt Commitment Letter may be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced as otherwise permitted hereby);

  



  

(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) or on other terms not less favorable to Parent in any
material respect than the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof but in no event later than
the Closing; _provided_ that in no event shall any such definitive financing
agreement contain terms (other than those included in the Debt Commitment
Letter) that would reasonably be expected to materially delay, hinder or
prevent the ability of Parent to consummate the Closing;

  



  

(iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of)
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent that are within
its control as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing and to comply with all of its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing;

  



  

(iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing; and

  



  

(v) give the Company prompt written notice of (A) any material
breach (or material breach threatened in writing) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter, any event or circumstance that makes a condition precedent
to the Financing unable or unlikely to be satisfied, any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements relating to the Financing with respect to the amount of
or the obligation to fund the Financing, or any termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement relating to the Financing, in
each case, of which Parent has become aware and (B) otherwise keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any Alternate Financing); _provided_  that in no event shall
Parent be under any obligation to disclose information that would waive the
protection of attorney-client privilege if such party shall have used
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this _Section 5.15_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent or any
Affiliate thereof to pay any fees or other amounts materially in excess of
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letter related
thereto (including pursuant to the "flex" provisions contained therein),
other than its legal and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

  



    

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter is terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to
Parent for any reason, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources for such
portion as promptly as practicable following such event (but no later than
the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur under _Section 2.02_ ) on
terms no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and in an amount sufficient, together with cash, if any, on hand of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company, to pay the Aggregate Closing
Merger Consideration and the other payments payable pursuant to _Article II_
and to consummate the Transactions (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") and, if
obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of the new financing commitment
on terms and conditions (including all terms, termination rights, flex
provisions and funding conditions) not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent than those included in the Debt Commitment Letter (an "
_Alternate Debt Commitment Letter_ "); _provided_ that the
Alternate Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, include any conditions precedent that are more onerous than or in
addition to the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) to, use
reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) to take all actions and things necessary, proper or
advisable to comply with the terms of _Section 5.15(a)_ as though the
references therein to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Financing were
instead references to the Alternate Debt Commitment Letter and the Alternate
Financing, respectively. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take all actions and things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the
Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any Alternate
Debt Commitment Letter, including by complying with its obligations under
_Section 5.15(b)_ as though the references therein to the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Financing were instead references to the Alternate
Debt Commitment Letter and the Alternate Financing, respectively.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to promptly provide, to Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is customary in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i) assist with the provision, execution and delivery of a credit
agreement, guarantees, pledges of collateral, certificates, documents as may
be reasonably requested by Parent to otherwise facilitate the pledging of
collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing
indebtedness to the extent contemplated by this Agreement and the release of
related Liens and termination of security interests and guarantees) and other
customary documents in connection with the Financing (or Alternate Financing,
as applicable);

  



  

(ii) provide Parent the Required Information and such other financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent that is required by the Debt Commitment
Letter and otherwise customarily required for completion of similar debt
financing as the Financing;

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|---

sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the Financing (or Alternate
Financing, as applicable); and (B) reasonably assist Parent and its Financing
Sources in obtaining ratings if and as contemplated by the Financing (or the
Alternate Financing, as applicable) and the preparation of all agreements
(including review of schedules for completeness), ratings agency

confidential and public bank information memoranda (including the
execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with
bank information memoranda to be included in the offering
documents contemplated in connection with the Financing (or Alternate
Financing, as applicable)), and other marketing materials reasonably required
for the Financing (or Alternate Financing, as applicable), in each case
subject to reimbursement by Parent pursuant to  _Section 5.15(e)_ ;

  



  

(iv) request its independent auditors to provide, consistent with
customary practice, (i) reasonable assistance in preparing offering
documents, bank information memorandum, and similar marketing documents that
include or incorporate the Company's consolidated financial information and
their reports thereon, in each case, to the extent such consent is required,
(ii) reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma financial
statements by Parent, (iii) customary comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort) upon completion of customary procedures, and
(iv) reasonable assistance and cooperation to Parent with respect to any
auditor due diligence;

  



  

(v) permit the Lenders to evaluate the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of
establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing Date and to assist
with other reasonable and customary collateral audits and due diligence
examinations;

  



  

(vi) take all corporate actions reasonably requested by Parent that
are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Financing (or
Alternate Financing, as applicable) and to permit the proceeds thereof,
together with the cash at the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, if any
(not needed for other purposes), to be made available at the Closing to
consummate the Transactions; and

  



  

(vii) promptly provide all documentation and other information about
the Company and its Subsidiaries under "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to the extent required to consummate the
Financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (subject
to the receipt by Parent of customary confidentiality undertakings from the
recipients of such information);

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(viii) _provided_  that (u) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing shall be
responsible for the preparation of any pro forma financial information or
required to deliver any legal opinions or "cold comfort letters", (v) no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Lien on any of
their respective assets, in connection with the Financing or Alternate
Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time; (w) none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing
shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or expense or incur any
other liability in connection with the Financing or Alternate Financing prior
to the Effective Time; (x) no director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any agreement, certificate,
document or instrument with respect to the Financing or Alternate Financing
that would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other than the customary

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action
contemplated by this Section 5.15(d) that, in the good faith determination of
the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to
any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (z)
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any
information or take any action that will conflict with or violate its
organizational documents or applicable Law, or would result in a violation or
breach or default under any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or which would result in the waiver of a legal
privilege ( _provided_ that in the event that the Company or any other
Subsidiary thereof does not provide any information in reliance on this
clause (z), the Company or such Subsidiary (as applicable) shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide notice to Parent promptly upon obtaining
knowledge that such information is being withheld, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to communicate, to the extent permitted, the applicable
information in a way that would not have such an effect and to eliminate such
restrictions); it being understood and agreed that information and documents
provided by the Company may be delivered (i) as is customarily required to be
disclosed in any rating agency presentations, offering documents, placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda (confidential and public) and similar
documents related to any Financing or Alternate Financing or (ii) to any
agents, Lenders or prospective Lenders, ratings agencies and other financial
institutions and investors or their respective Representatives that are or

connection with any Financing or Alternate Financing (and, in each case, to
their respective counsel and auditors) in each case subject to confidentiality
undertakings customary for financings of the same type as such Financing or
Alternate Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing (
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

  



  

(e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable outside
attorneys' fees) incurred by such Person in connection with its cooperation
contemplated by this Section 5.15 (collectively, the " _Financing Expenses_
"), and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all Losses,
damages, Litigations, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with such
cooperation, the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in
connection therewith (other than any information provided in writing by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith),
except (x) to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of any such
indemnitee's, or such indemnitee's respective Representative's, gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (y) with respect to any
misstatement or omission in any information provided hereunder by any of the
foregoing Persons expressly for use in connection therewith. All Financing
Expenses and all Losses described in the immediately preceding sentence shall
not constitute Transaction Expenses or Current Liabilities and, to the extent
unreimbursed by the Cut-off Time, the amount thereof shall be added to the
calculation of Closing Cash. The provisions of this Section 5.15(e) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

  



  

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 7.01 _Survival_. The parties, intending to modify any
applicable statute of limitations, agree that (a) the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and in any other Transaction Agreement
will survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, at which date such representations and
warranties shall terminate, (b) the Pre-Closing Covenants of the Company will
survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, at which date such Pre-Closing Covenants
shall terminate and (c) the Post-Closing Covenants shall survive the
Closing and be enforceable in accordance with their respective terms until
each such Post-Closing Covenant has been performed. The applicable survival
periods described in this _Section 7.01_ supersede any applicable statute of
limitations with respect to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, and any claim brought by any party pursuant to this _Article VII_
must be brought in accordance with _Section 7.05_ or filed prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period. The limitations on survival set
forth in this _Section 7.01_ shall not apply to claims based on Actual Fraud,
which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. If a party makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_ in accordance with _Section 7.05_ on or prior to the date on
which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim
is based terminates as set forth in this _Section 7.01_ , and such claim is
not fully and finally resolved prior to the end of the applicable survival
period, such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall
survive with respect to such claim until such claim is finally and fully
resolved. No claim for indemnification may be asserted for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless
written notice of such claim is received in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

  



  

Section 7.02 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_.
Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VII_ , from and
after the Closing Date, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
make a claim for, and may recover:

  



  

(a) solely from the General Holdback Escrow Account and under the
RWI Policy (and not from any other Person), all Losses that the Parent
Indemnified Parties may incur, sustain or pay based upon, arising out of or
by reason of any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the
Company contained in any Transaction Agreement; and

  



  

(b) solely from the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account (as may be
increased by the Other Matters Excess Claim Amount) (and not from any other
Person), all Losses that the Parent Indemnified Parties may incur, sustain or
pay based upon, arising out of or by reason of: (i) any breach or non-
fulfillment of any Pre-Closing Covenant to be performed by the Company or the
Stockholders' Representative or any Post-Closing Covenant to be performed by
the Stockholders' Representative or (ii) the matter set forth on
_Appendix A_.

  



  

Section 7.03 _Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties_.
Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VII_ , from and
after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify each Seller Indemnified Party
against, and shall hold each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from and
against all Losses incurred, sustained or paid by such Seller Indemnified
Party based upon, arising out of or by reason of:

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Parent
or Merger Sub contained in any Transaction Agreement; or

  



  

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any Pre-Closing Covenant to be
performed by Parent or Merger Sub or Post-Closing Covenant to be performed by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.04 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for
in _Section 7.02_ and _Section 7.03_ will be subject to the following
limitations:

  



  

(a) There shall be no liability for indemnification under _Section
7.02(a)_ , until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of all
indemnification claims asserted by the Parent Indemnified Parties thereunder
exceeds the Deductible, in which event the Indemnifying Party will only be
required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible. With
respect to any claim for indemnification under _Section 7.02(a)_, no Parent
Indemnified Party may recover, and no Indemnifying Party will be liable for,
any individual or series of related Losses that do not exceed the Mini-Basket
(which Losses will not be counted towards the Deductible); _provided_  that
the foregoing limitations in this _Section 7.04(a)_ shall not apply to the
Company Fundamental Representations or claims based on Actual Fraud, with
respect to which, in each case, all Losses in connection therewith shall be
recoverable from the first dollar. There shall be no liability for
indemnification under _Section 7.02(b)(ii)_ , until the aggregate amount of
all Losses in respect of all indemnification claims asserted by the Parent
Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds the Mini-Basket, in which event the
Indemnifying Party will only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in
excess of the Mini-Basket.

  



  

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses that the Parent Indemnified
Parties may recover pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ shall not exceed the
General Indemnity Holdback Amount; _provided_ that no provision herein will
prohibit any Parent Indemnified Party from recovery of amounts under the RWI
Policy. The aggregate amount of all Losses that the Parent Indemnified Parties
may recover pursuant to _Sections 7.02(b)(i)_ and _7.02(b)(ii)_ shall not
exceed an amount equal to the sum of the Other Matters Indemnity Holdback
Amount and the Other Matters Excess Claim Amount. A Parent Indemnified Party
may only recover Losses (i) pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ from the General
Holdback Escrow Account and under the RWI Policy and (ii) pursuant to
_Sections 7.02(b)(i)_ and _7.02(b)(ii) from_ the Other Matters Holdback
Escrow Account (as may be increased by the Other Matters Excess Claim
Amount), and in no event may a Parent Indemnified Party recover any Losses
under _Article VII_ directly from any Securityholder (or any other Person).

  



  

(c) There shall be no liability for indemnification under _Section
7.03(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
all indemnification claims asserted by the Seller Indemnified Parties
thereunder exceeds the Deductible, in which event the Indemnifying Party will
only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible.
With respect to any claim for indemnification under _Section 7.03(a)_, no
Seller Indemnified Party may recover, and no Indemnifying Party will be liable
for, any individual or series of related Losses that do not exceed the Mini-
Basket (which Losses will not be counted towards the Deductible); _provided_
 that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the Parent Fundamental
Representations or claims based on Actual Fraud, with respect to which, in
each case, all Losses in connection therewith shall be recoverable from the
first dollar.

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_ will be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Parties in respect of any such claim
from insurance policies, and all indemnity, contribution and similar payments
received by the Indemnified Party (or its parent or any of its Subsidiaries)
from third parties in respect of any such claim. The Indemnified Party will
use its reasonable best efforts (for a reasonable period of time) to
recover under insurance policies and indemnity, contribution and similar
agreements for any Losses prior to collecting any amounts under  _Article
VII_ of this Agreement; _provided_ that using such efforts by the Indemnified
Parties shall not be a precondition to making a claim for Losses by such
Indemnified Party in accordance with this _Article VII_. If the Indemnified
Party (or its parent or any of its Subsidiaries) receives any such payment
with respect to a claim after it has already received an
indemnification payment on account of such claim, then such payment shall be
applied first, to reimburse the Indemnified Party for any Losses with respect
to such claim for which it has not been fully compensated and any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)
expended by it in pursuing such recovery or defending any claims arising
therefrom, second, to reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses) expended by it in pursuing such recovery or defending any claims
arising therefrom, and third, to reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the
amount of the indemnification payment made to the extent that such amount was
not already deducted from the indemnification payment made by the
Indemnifying Party or from the General Holdback Escrow Account or Other
Matters Holdback Escrow Account (as applicable), or, prior to the Escrow
Expiration Date, return such amount to the General Holdback Escrow Account or
Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account (as applicable).

  



  

(e) Payments from the General Holdback Escrow Account or Other
Matters Holdback Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 7.02_ or by
an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 7.03_ , in each case, in respect
of any Loss will be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax benefit to the
extent realized or reasonably expected to be realized (within the taxable year
in which the Loss was incurred or the immediately following taxable year) as
a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party (or its parent or any of its
Subsidiaries).

  



  

(f) In no event will any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover
any punitive, exemplary, speculative damages, damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable or any damages based on any type of multiple (except
to the extent any Parent Indemnified Party is liable for the same pursuant to
any Third-Party Claim).

  



  

(g) In no event will any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to
recover any Losses to the extent such Losses (i) were reserved for in the
Interim Financial Statements, (ii) are taken into account in the calculation
of Final Closing Working Capital or (iii) are included in the calculation of
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount.

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) In no event will an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover for
any Losses relating to such Indemnified Party's (or its Affiliates') own
general and administrative time, allocation of personnel wages, other overhead
expenses or other similar internal costs.

  



  

(i) For purposes of determining the existence of any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant and for calculating the amount of any
Losses arising from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant,
all representations, warranties and covenants shall be treated as if the
words "material," "materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar words or phrases containing such words were omitted from
such representations, warranties and covenants, except for (i) the
representations set forth in _Section 3.05_, which shall, for purposes of
determining any breach of _Section 3.05_ and Losses related thereto, retain
the Material Adverse Effect qualification therein and (ii) the
representations set forth in _Section 3.13(a)_. The indemnification
obligations of the parties hereto or recovery from the General Holdback
Escrow Account or the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account, as applicable,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by an Indemnified Party
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of any of
the Indemnified Parties or any of their Representatives.

  



  

(j) Each Indemnifying Party waives, and acknowledges and agrees that
such Indemnifying Party shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, subrogation, right
of indemnity or other similar right or remedy against any of the
Securityholders, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which such Indemnifying Party may become subject under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.05 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



    

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice
of the assertion or commencement of any Litigation made or brought by
any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to
this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_
") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which an Indemnifying Party
is reasonably likely to be obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice will
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third-Party
Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, within five Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of having received
notice of the applicable Third-Party Claim, to assume, the defense of any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in
good faith in such defense; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (i) unless the
Indemnifying Party confirms in writing to the Indemnified Party that, as
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated with respect to such Third-Party Claim (subject in
all respects to the limitations contained in this Agreement), or (ii) if
such Third-Party Claim (A) involves a material customer or subcontractor of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) is likely to result in
Losses that will exceed the amount of indemnification that the Indemnifying
Party would be liable to pay to the Indemnified Party or that remains in the
General Holdback Escrow Account or the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account,
as applicable, (C) involves any Tax matter applicable to Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (D)
involves the matter set forth on _Appendix A_; _provided_ that, with respect
to the matter set forth on _Appendix A_, the Indemnified Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to contest any Third-Party Claim related thereto in
good faith and shall not settle any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If the Third-Party Claim includes allegations for
which the Indemnifying Party both would and would not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may, in that case,
jointly assume the defense thereof with the Indemnifying Party if the
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to
_Section 7.05(b)_, it will have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party will have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 7.05(b)_, pay, compromise, and
defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim, including the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period following notice of such Third-Party Claim
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of such
Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and Parent
will cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Any settlement or
compromise made or caused to be made by an Indemnified Party or an
Indemnifying Party of a Third-Party Claim may only be made with the prior
written consent of the applicable other party; _provided_ that if such Third-
Party Claim consists only of money damages in an amount to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party (or from the General Holdback Escrow Account or the Other
Matters Holdback Escrow Account) and such settlement or compromise provides,
in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party
Claim, the prior written consent of an Indemnified Party is not required.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party will have assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, no Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates will admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account
of a Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_
") will be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
will not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

Section 7.06 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party will use
reasonable best efforts to mitigate all indemnifiable Losses after becoming
aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in
connection herewith; _provided_ that the exhaustion of all such efforts by
the Indemnified Parties shall not be a precondition to the making of a claim
of Losses by such Indemnified Party in accordance with _Article VII_. Except
pursuant to a settlement agreed to by the Indemnifying Party, no Indemnified
Party will waive or release any contractual right to recover from a third
party any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

Section 7.07 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement will be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

Section 7.08 _Exclusive Remedies_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that from and after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to all claims (other than claims for breaches of Post-Closing
Covenants), regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed (whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in, or
otherwise relating to the subject matter of, any Transaction Agreement, will
be the remedies provided in _Section 2.16_, _Section 9.11_ and the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VII_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
under Law, all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims for
breaches of Post-Closing Covenants) for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements it may have
against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to _Section 2.16_, _Section 9.11 _and the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ ; provided that the foregoing shall
not limit any claims or rights of (a) the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to the RWI Policy or (b) any Parent Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party with respect to Actual Fraud.

  



    

 | 61|

Section 7.09 _General Indemnity Holdback Amount; Other Matters
Holdback Escrow Amount; Escrow Release_.

  



  

(a) Any amounts owing under _Section 7.02_ shall be satisfied by
wire transfer of immediately available funds solely from, and the rights of
the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification relating to this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be strictly limited to recovery from, the then
remaining balance of the General Holdback Escrow Account, the Other Matters
Holdback Escrow Account and the RWI Policy. Any amounts owing under _Section
7.03_ shall be paid by Parent to the applicable Seller Indemnified Party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business Days after
the final determination thereof.

  



  

(b) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow
Expiration Date_ "), Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall
deliver a Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to, or as directed by, the Stockholders' Representative, for the
benefit of the Securityholders such amount, if any, of the General
Indemnity Holdback Amount then remaining in the General Holdback Escrow
Account less an amount equal to (i) the aggregate dollar amount of claims for
Losses made by the Parent Indemnified Parties in good faith through the Escrow
Expiration Date pursuant to Section 7.02(a) that are then outstanding and
unresolved, _plus_ (ii) the Other Matters Excess Claim Amount (such amounts of
the retained General Indemnity Holdback Amount, as it may be further reduced
after the Escrow Expiration Date by distributions to, or for the benefit of,
the Securityholders as set forth below and recoveries by a Parent Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Article VII_ , the " _Retained General Indemnity Escrow
Amount_ ").

  



  

(c) On the Escrow Expiration Date, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to, or as directed by, the
Stockholders' Representative, for the benefit of the Securityholders such
amount, if any, of the Other Matters Indemnity Holdback Amount then remaining
in the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account less an amount equal to the
aggregate dollar amount of claims for Losses made by the Parent Indemnified
Parties in good faith through the Escrow Expiration Date pursuant to _Section
7.02(b)(i)_ and _7.02(b)(ii)_ that are then outstanding and unresolved (such
amounts of the retained Other Matters Indemnity Holdback Amount, as it may be
further reduced after the Escrow Expiration Date by distributions to, or for
the benefit of, the Securityholders as set forth below and recoveries by a
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article VII_ and increased by the Other
Matters Excess Claim Amount, the " _Retained Other Matters Escrow Amount_ ");
provided that if the aggregate dollar amount of claims for Losses made by the
Parent Indemnified Parties in good faith through the Escrow Expiration Date
pursuant to _Section_ _7.02(b)(i)_ and _7.02(b)(ii)_ that are
then outstanding and unresolved exceeds the Other Matters Indemnity Holdback
Amount as of the Escrow Expiration Date, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall deliver a Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to withdraw an amount equal to the Other Matters Excess
Claim Amount from the General Holdback Escrow Account and deposit such amount
into the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account.

  



    

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any amount received by the Stockholders Representative from the
General Holdback Escrow Account or the Other Matters Holdback Escrow Account
shall be allocated among and paid to the Securityholders as if such amount had
been included in the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration at the Closing
Date. If and to the extent that after the Escrow Expiration Date, any claim
for Losses is resolved for any amount less than what was retained for such
claim in the applicable escrow account at the Escrow Expiration Date,
then Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall deliver a Joint
Direction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to,
or as directed by, the Stockholders' Representative, for the benefit of the
Securityholders, an aggregate amount of the Retained General Indemnity Escrow
Amount or the Retained Other Matters Escrow Amount (as the case may be) equal
to such difference; _provided_ that such distribution shall only be made, in
the case of the Retained General Indemnity Escrow Amount, to the extent that
the Retained General Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining after such distribution
would be sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all unresolved claims
for Losses made by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
7.02(a) and, in the case of the Retained Other Matters Escrow Amount, to the
extent that the Retained Other Matters Escrow Amount remaining after such
distribution would be sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all
unresolved claims for Losses made by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 7.02(b)(i) and 7.02(b)(ii). If and to the extent that, after the
Escrow Expiration Date, any outstanding claim made by any Parent Indemnified
Party for a Loss is resolved in favor of such Parent Indemnified Party,
such Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover an amount from the
Retained General Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Retained Other Matters Escrow
Amount (as the case may be) equal to the amount of the outstanding claim
resolved in favor of such Parent Indemnified Party.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. On or prior to
the date hereof, Parent or Merger Sub shall obtain ( _i.e._ , have bound), at
its sole cost and expense, a purchaser-side representations and warranties
policy in connection with the Transactions (the " _RWI Policy_ ") on terms
and conditions substantially equivalent to those set forth on _Appendix C_.
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into or
consent to, any amendment to, or termination, cancellation or revocation of,
the RWI Policy following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of any Seller Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, neither any revocation, cancellation or
modification of the RWI Policy after the Closing Date, nor any inability of,
nor any denial by the RWI Policy insurer to pay Losses, shall result in
additional liability hereunder to any Seller Indemnified Party.

TERMINATION

  



  

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

  



  

(b) by either Parent or the Company at any time after 5:00 p.m. New
York City time on June 5, 2017 (the " _Termination Date_ ") if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to such date; _provided_ that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_ if such party's or any of
its Affiliate's breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenants of such party set forth in this Agreement has resulted
in or has caused the failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ that if the Marketing Period has commenced, but the
Marketing Period has not been completed on or before such Termination Date,
the Termination Date shall be extended for the remainder of the Marketing

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) by the Company or Parent, if (i) any restraint or other Order of
the type set forth in _Section 6.01(a)_ permanently prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions shall have become final and non-appealable or
(ii) any Law has been enacted or promulgated by any Governmental Authority
that makes the consummation of the Transactions illegal;

  



  

(d) by Parent, if any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in _Article III_ shall be or shall have become inaccurate or the
Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants set
forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would
give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02_
, and which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform cannot be cured by the
Company or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to
the earlier of (i) two Business Days prior to the Termination Date and (ii)
the date that is 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of notice in
writing from Parent specifying the nature of such inaccuracy, breach or
failure to perform and requesting that it be cured; _provided_ that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.01(d)_ if either Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of this
Agreement and such breach would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.03_ ;

  



  

(e) by the Company, if any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in _Article IV_ shall be or shall have become inaccurate
or Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective covenants set forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or
failure to perform would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in  _Section 6.03_ , and which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or, if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) two
Business Days prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is 30
calendar days after receipt by Parent of notice in writing from the Company
specifying the nature of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform and
requesting that it be cured; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if it is
then in breach of this Agreement and such breach would give rise to the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02_ ;

  



  

(f) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions to the Closing set
forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until
the Closing but which were capable of being satisfied assuming the Closing
occurred), (ii) Parent and the Merger Sub fail to fulfill their obligation to
effect the Closing by the date they were required to do so pursuant to
_Section 2.02_ , (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Parent that the Company is ready, willing and able to
perform its obligations to effect the Closing, and (iv) Parent fails to
consummate the Closing within two Business Days following the later of receipt
of the writing described in clause (iii) and the date the Closing should have
occurred in accordance with _Section 2.02_ ; or

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) by Parent, if the closing condition set forth in _Section
6.01(c)_ shall not have been satisfied within 24 hours following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(g)_  must be exercised, if
exercisable, within 48 hours following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of clause (b),
(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this _Section 8.01_ shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.01_
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected (it being understood that such terminating party may only specify one
provision pursuant to which such termination is effected).

  



  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination; Etc._

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
8.01_ , this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect and
the Transactions shall be abandoned, and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Stockholders' Representative except (i) that _Article I_ , _Section 5.07_ ,
_Section 5.15(e)_ , this  _Section 8.02_, _Article IX_ (other than _Section
9.12_ ) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of this
Agreement and remain valid and binding obligations of each of the parties
hereto and thereto and (ii) that termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ shall not release (x) any party from any liability for any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by another party, to the extent
such liabilities or damages were the result of Actual Fraud or the
knowing and intentional breach by such party of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement or (y) Parent from any
obligation to pay the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 8.02_.
For purposes of this Agreement, "knowing and intentional breach" shall mean a
material breach that is a consequence of an omission by, an act undertaken by
or caused by, or a breach of a representation or warranty by the breaching
party with the actual knowledge that the omission, the taking or causing of
such act or the making of such representation or warranty would cause a breach
of this Agreement. If the sole reason that Parent and Merger Sub fail to
fulfill their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.02_ is due to a Financing Failure, such failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on such date shall not be deemed
to be a knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement. If Parent and
Merger Sub fail to fulfill their obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the date the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section 2.02_ other than as a result of a Financing Failure,
such failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
such date shall be deemed to be a knowing and intentional breach of this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.01(f)_ or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_  and, at
the time of such termination, this Agreement could have been terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_  (notwithstanding any advance notice
requirements set forth in such section), then Parent shall pay to the Company
(or its designees) the Termination Fee as soon as practicable (but in any
case no later than two Business Days) following any such termination.

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If Parent fails to pay the Termination Fee when due, then
interest shall accrue on the amount of such Termination Fee from (and
including) the date of termination of this Agreement to the date of payment
at the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made (as published by The Wall Street Journal)
per annum, compounded quarterly.

  



  

(d) If Parent pays the Termination Fee when due, such Termination
Fee will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of this Agreement that will fairly compensate the Company for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and that, if paid pursuant
to _Section 8.02_ , shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all
damages and liability arising as a result of any termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of a Specified Termination, the Company's right to receive payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.02_ (together with any interest due
thereon pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ ) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and any Company Related Party for any Loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith,
and all other rights or claims of the Company or any Company Related Party,
arising out of this Agreement, the Transactions or the Financing, or the
failure of any of the foregoing to be consummated, whether at Law or in
equity, on any theory of liability, including in contract, tort or otherwise,
against Parent, Merger Sub, all Parent Related Parties and any Financing
Sources are hereby deemed waived (except for Parent's obligation to reimburse
the costs and expenses specified in and pursuant to _Section 5.15(e)_ ).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon
payment of the Termination Fee (together with any interest due thereon
pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ ) following a Specified Termination, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party or any Financing Sources shall
have any further liability or obligation to the Company or any Company Related
Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transactions or the
Financing, or the failure of any of the foregoing to be consummated, in each
case whether based on contract (including the Debt Commitment Letter (or
Alternate Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable), this Agreement
or otherwise), tort or otherwise, by enforcement of any assessment, by any
legal, equitable or arbitral proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation
or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto
or another Person (except for Parent's obligation to reimburse the costs and
expenses specified in and pursuant to _Section 5.15(e)_ ). In no
circumstances will Parent be required to (x) pay the Termination Fee more
than once, or (y) pay any amount of damages in excess of the Termination Fee
if the Company has received the Termination Fee in connection with a
Specified Termination.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a court has
determined to grant an award of damages for a knowing and intentional breach
of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub agree that
(i) such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-
pocket costs and shall, in addition to any damage to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, include damages resulting from the benefit of the bargain lost
by the Securityholders (taking into consideration all relevant matters,
including the loss of the expected premium, other combination opportunities
and the time value of money), and (ii) the Company may assign or transfer all
right, title and interest to, or direct Parent and Merger Sub to make payment
of, all or any portion of such award to the Securityholders. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this _Section 8.02(f)_ shall
be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under _Section 9.11_.

Section 8.03 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary and subject to and without derogation of the
rights of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates under the Debt
Commitment Letter (or Alternate Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable), the
parties hereto agree, on behalf of themselves and each of their former,
current or future officers, directors, managers, employees, members,
partners, stockholders, agents and other representatives and Affiliates (the "
_Applicable Parties_ "), that the Financing Sources, each other Lender and
each of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives and
Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns, shall be subject to no
liability or claims to the Applicable Parties in connection with financing any
portion of the Financing or Alternate Financing or in any way relating to
this Agreement, any of the Transactions, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Financing (or any Alternate Debt Commitment Letter or Alternate Financing, as
applicable), whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and hereby waives any rights or claims and agrees not to commence any
proceedings against such Persons in connection with this Agreement, any of
the Transactions, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing (or any
Alternate Debt Commitment Letter or Alternate Financing, as applicable).
Nothing in this _Section 8.03_ shall in any way expand the circumstances in
which Parent or Merger Sub may be liable under this Agreement, any of the
Transactions, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing (or any Alternate
Debt Commitment Letter or Alternate Financing, as applicable).

Section 9.02 _Amendment; Waiver, Etc._ Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if,
such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, modification or supplement, by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and the Stockholders' Representative, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_
 that _Section 8.02(f)_ , _Section 8.03_ , _Section 9.03_ , _Section 9.06_ ,
_Section 9.08(c)_ and this _Section 9.02_ shall not be amended or otherwise
modified in any way that materially and adversely affects the rights of
any Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing
Source. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement may assign any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any attempt to assign this Agreement
without such consent shall be void and of no effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall be permitted, without the consent of any other party
hereto, to make a collateral assignment of its rights under this Agreement to
any Financing Source in connection with the Closing; _provided_ , that no such
assignment shall (i) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under
this Agreement, or (ii) enlarge, alter or change any right or obligation of
any other party hereto.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement_

  



  

. The Transaction Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to such matters. The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon
the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.06 _Parties in Interest_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
provided in _Section 9.06(b)_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub, the
Stockholders' Representative, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
of their respective successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement.

provisions of:

  



  

(i) _Section 2.07_ , _Section 2.12_ , _Section 2.15_ , _Section

shall be entitled to rely on, such sections;

  



  

(ii) _Section 2.08_ , _Section 2.15_ , _Section 2.16_ and _Section
5.09_ , to the extent they apply to holders of Options, which shall be

sections;

Persons, which shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on, such section;

  



  

(iv) _Section 7.10_ , to the extent it applies to Seller Indemnified
Parties, which shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on, such section;

  



  

(v) _Section 9.12_ , to the extent it applies to Proskauer, which
shall be an express third-party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to rely
on, such section;

  



  

(vi) _Section 8.02(f)_ , _Section 8.03_ , _Section 9.02_ , _Section
9.03_ , _Section 9.08(c)_ and this _Section 9.06_ , to the extent they apply
to the Financing Sources, which shall be express third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to rely on, such sections; and

  



  

(vii) _Section 9.15_ , to the extent it applies to Released Persons,
which shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to
rely on, such section.

a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

this Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the
Transactions shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses.

Section 9.08 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and any Litigation in any way arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, the Transactions or the legal relationship of the parties (whether
at law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise), shall
be governed by and enforced pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to rules of conflict of laws that would result in the
application of Laws of any other jurisdiction. Each party hereby
irrevocably agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware situated in New Castle
County and any State of Delaware appellate court therefrom or, to the extent
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware situated in New Castle County
does not have subject matter jurisdiction or declines to accept personal
jurisdiction over any party, any state or federal court within New Castle
County in the State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom
(collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") in any Litigation described in the
immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 9.08(a)_  that is brought by
any such party or its successors or assigns. Each party irrevocably consents
to the service of any and all process in any such Litigation by the delivery
of such process in the manner provided in _Section 9.01_. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any Litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, the Transactions
or the legal relationship of the parties (whether at law or in equity, and
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) in the Chosen Courts, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Chosen Court that any such Litigation brought in any Chosen Court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that it will not
bring or support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any
Litigation (including any cross-claim or third-party claim) of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
in any forum other than the Chosen Courts, and that the provisions of
_Section 9.08(b)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
such Litigation. Each party further agrees that any final and nonappealable
judgment against any of them in any Litigation described in the first
sentence of this _Section 9.08(a)_ shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on
judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact
and amount of such judgment.

  



  

(b) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such
party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or
the legal relationship between the parties (whether at law or in equity, and
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise). Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no Representative of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, if there is any
Litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) such party understands
and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes
this waiver voluntarily and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section 9.08(b)_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.08 to the contrary,
with respect to any disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions (whether in law, contract, tort, equity or
otherwise), in each case, to the extent involving the Financing Sources, each
of the parties hereto (i) agrees that such dispute or controversy shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New
York, (ii) consents to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (iii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such exclusive jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iv) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to any such matter in any court other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York
(and appellate courts thereof) and (v) waives any right to trial by jury with
respect to any action related to or arising out of any such matter.

Section 9.09 _Counterparts, Etc._ This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party
and, except as otherwise set forth herein, at the expense of the party so
requesting, each other party shall execute and deliver to such
requesting party such documents and take such other action as such requesting
party may reasonably request to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement are uniquely related to the
desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate
the Transactions, and the Transactions represent a unique business
opportunity at a unique time for each of the parties and their
respective Affiliates; therefore (i) irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms
and, (ii) although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such
covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
therefor. Accordingly, subject to _Section 9.11(c)_ , each party agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that if the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, breaches or threatens to breach any
provision of this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain such
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any such order or injunction, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or other security. If any Litigation should be
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall
allege, and each party waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy
at law. The rights in this _Section 9.11_ are in addition to any other remedy
to which a party may be entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations herein), and the exercise by a party of one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) To the extent any party brings any Litigation to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when available to such
party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall be
extended to such time period as may be established by the court presiding
over such Litigation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including _Section 9.11(a)_ ), neither the Company nor the
Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other
form of specific performance or equitable relief described in
_Section 9.11(a)_ , to cause (x) the Closing to be consummated or (y) the
Merger Consideration, or any portion thereof, to be paid, unless each of the
following conditions has been satisfied:

  



  

(i) all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 6.01_
and _Section 6.02_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but which
conditions are fully capable of being satisfied assuming the Closing occurs);

  



  

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to fulfill their obligation to effect
the Closing by the date they were required to do so pursuant to
_Section 2.02_ ;

  



  

(iii) the Lenders have funded or will fund the Financing or Alternate
Financing at the Closing; and

  



  

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to
Parent that the Company is ready, willing and able to perform its
obligations to effect the Closing.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Section 9.11(c)_ or anywhere else herein to the contrary, under no
circumstances will the Company, the Stockholders' Representative or any
Company Related Party be permitted or entitled to receive payment of a
Termination Fee in circumstances in which the Closing is consummated and the
Merger Consideration is paid.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that each of
Proskauer and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (each, " _Seller
's Counsel_") has acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries,
the Stockholders' Representative, certain of the direct and indirect holders
of shares of Common Stock and certain of their respective Affiliates prior to
the date hereof, and that Seller's Counsel intends to act as legal counsel to
the Stockholders' Representative, certain of the direct and indirect holders
of shares of Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (which will no
longer include the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees
to cause its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Seller's Counsel
representing the Stockholders' Representative, any direct or indirect holders
of the shares of Common Stock or their respective Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or the Transactions. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between the
Stockholders' Representative, direct and indirect holders of shares of Common
Stock, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller's Counsel, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions shall be
deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Stockholders' Representative, the direct and indirect holders of shares of
Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Seller's Counsel relating to such engagement
from and after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, (a) the Stockholders'
Representative, the direct and indirect holders of shares of Common Stock and
their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Seller's Counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Stockholders' Representative, the direct and
indirect holders of shares of Common Stock and their respective Affiliates
(and not the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Seller's Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between Seller's Counsel and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is waiving any attorney-
client privilege (including relating to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transactions) in connection with any third party
Litigation.

Section 9.13 _Disclaimer_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set
forth in _Article III_ are and shall constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties made with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person has made or is making any express or implied
representations or warranty, statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including
with respect to any express or implied representation or warranty as to the
merchantability, quality, quantity, suitability or fitness for any particular
purpose of the business or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder, all other warranties, express
or implied, statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including with respect to
any express or implied representation or warranty as to the merchantability,
quality, quantity, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose of the
business or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are hereby
expressly disclaimed. Parent and Merger Sub represent, warrant, covenant and

the Transactions, they are not relying upon, and have not been induced by,
any representation or warranty made or purportedly made by or on behalf of any
Person, other than those expressly made by the Company as set forth in
_Article III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder. In determining to
purchase the Company, Parent and Merger Sub further represent, warrant,
covenant and agree that they did not rely (and expressly disclaim
reliance) on any estimate, projection, forecast, plan, budget or other

(including in any "data rooms" or management presentations), and that all
of the foregoing materials and all similar materials shall not be deemed to

explicitly set forth in the representations and warranties made by the Company
in _Article III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder (including
representations and warranties relating to the delivery, and accuracy, of
documents and other materials).

Section 9.14 _Due Diligence Review_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
represents, warrants, covenants and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that: (a) it has completed to its satisfaction its own due
diligence investigation, and based thereon, formed its own
independent judgment with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
(b) it has been furnished with or given full access to such documents and
information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses and operations as it and its Representatives have deemed necessary
to enable it to make a fully informed decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions. In entering
into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub further represents,
warrants, covenants and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that it
has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article
III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder and that other than the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article
III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder, no representation or warranty
has been or is being made by the Company or any other Person as to the
accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives (including
any "data rooms" or management presentations). Each of Parent and Merger Sub
represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that: (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make estimates, projections, forecasts, plans,
budgets and similar materials and information; (ii) they are familiar with
such uncertainties, and are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy of any and all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans, budgets and other materials or information
that may have been delivered or made available to it or any of their
Representatives and advisors; (iii) they have not relied or will not rely on
such information; and (iv) that neither they nor any of their respective
Affiliates will assert, any claims against the Company (or against its
Subsidiaries or any Company Related Party) with respect thereto; _provided _
that nothing in _Section 9.13_ or this _Section 9.14_ will limit any of the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article
III_ or any certificate delivered hereunder or the rights of any
Indemnified Party with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Release_.

  



  

(a) As of the Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and all of their
respective Affiliates, the Company and its Subsidiaries and, as of
immediately following the Closing, the Affiliates of the Company (each, a "
_Releasing Person_ "), hereby releases and forever discharges each of (i) Ares
Corporate Opportunities Fund III, L.P. and Sotera Equity Partners, L.P. (in
each case, in its capacity as a Securityholder) and the former or current

Litigation, covenants, torts, damages and all defenses, offsets, judgments,
demands and liabilities whatsoever, of every name and nature, both at Law and
in equity, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued, that have been or could
have been asserted against any Released Person, which any Releasing Person
has or ever had, that arises out of or in any way relates to
events, circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken prior to or as
of the Closing Date in respect of matters directly or indirectly relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 9.15_ does not limit the provisions of _Section 7.02_ or the rights
of any Indemnified Party thereunder or any representation, warranty, covenant

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub:

  



  

(i) represents and warrants that it is fully aware of the provisions
of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides as follows: "A general
release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect
to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if
known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with
the debtor."

  



  

(ii) expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits that
the Releasing Persons may have under applicable Law, including any state
Law (including the above referenced California Civil Code section) or any
common Law principles limiting waivers of unknown claims,

and Merger Sub gives this full and complete release and discharge of the
Released Persons may hereafter prove to be different than now known or
believed to be true by Parent and Merger Sub and

  



  

(iv) accepts and assumes the risk thereof and agrees that the
Releasing Persons' full and complete release and discharge of the
Released Persons with respect to the matters described in this _Section 9.15_
shall remain effective in all respects and not be subject to termination,
rescission or modification by reason of any such difference in facts and
circumstances.

  



  

Section 9.16 _Stockholders ' Representative_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto have agreed that it is desirable to designate
the Stockholders' Representative to act on behalf of the Securityholders for
certain limited purposes, as specified herein, and the Stockholders'
Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed, to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable Law, as the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of
the Securityholders to act as the Stockholders' Representative under the
Transaction Agreements in accordance with the terms thereof and the
Stockholders' Representative is authorized and empowered to act for, and on
behalf of, any or all of the Securityholders in matters reasonably necessary
or advisable for the consummation of the Transactions, including having the
authority to (i) execute and deliver all documents that the Stockholders'
Representative is authorized to execute and deliver under the Transaction
Agreements, (ii) make all other elections or decisions that the Stockholders'
Representative is authorized to make under any Transaction Agreement, (iii)
enter into or approve waivers, amendments, clarifications or post-Closing
modifications to any Transaction Agreement, (iv)(A) dispute, negotiate or
compromise or refrain from disputing, negotiating or compromising on behalf of
each Securityholder, any remedies or amounts to be received by such

perform each such act and thing whatsoever that the Stockholders'
Representative may be or is required to do, or which the Stockholders'
Representative in its sole good faith discretion determines is desirable to
do, pursuant to or to carry out the intent of the Transaction Agreements. All
such actions and determinations shall be deemed to be facts
ascertainable outside of the Transaction Agreements and shall be binding on
the Securityholders. The Stockholders' Representative shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Transaction
Agreements, and no implied covenants, agreements, functions, duties,
responsibilities, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The grant of authority provided for in this _Section 9.16_ , (i)
is an agency coupled with an interest and is being granted, in part, as an
inducement to the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement

Stockholders' Representative acting by signing as the

that it is unavailable to perform its duties hereunder, then, as soon as
practicable after notice of such advice, an alternative Stockholders'
Representative will be appointed by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Common Stock. Any references in this Agreement to the
Stockholders' Representative shall be deemed to include any duly appointed
successor Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(d) The Stockholders' Representative will not be entitled to any
fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services
hereunder, but shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the
Securityholders, for any and all Stockholders' Representative Expenses. In
furtherance thereof, the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount shall be
paid to and held by the Stockholders' Representative in an account
established by the Stockholders' Representative and set forth on the Closing
Payments Statement (the " _Stockholders ' Representative Expense Fund_") to
enable it to satisfy its obligations hereunder and out of which the
Stockholders' Representative may cause to be paid, or reimburse itself
for the payment of, any Stockholders' Representative Expenses. If the
Stockholders' Representative determines that any then-remaining balance of
the Stockholders' Representative Expense Fund is not sufficient to pay actual
or anticipated Stockholders' Representative Expenses, the Stockholders'
Representative shall be entitled to (i) withhold funds from any payment
to the Securityholders to be made hereunder or any other Transaction
Agreement (including from the Net Adjustment Amount or the Indemnity Holdback
Released Amount) or (ii) seek reimbursement or indemnification from the
Securityholders, in each case, on a Proceeds Percentage basis in respect of
such insufficiency of funds as determined by the Stockholders' Representative;
_provided_  that (A) any obligation of the Securityholders shall be several
and not joint, (B) the Stockholders' Representative shall not be indemnified
or receive reimbursement for any such expenses, charges or liabilities
incurred as a result of the Stockholders' Representative's gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud and (C) if it is finally adjudicated that a
Stockholders' Representative Expenses or any portion thereof was primarily
caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the
Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders' Representative shall reimburse
the Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Stockholders'
Representative Expenses attributable to such gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) In dealing with the Transaction Agreements and any instruments,
agreements or documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to
exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholders'
Representative thereunder, (i) the Stockholders' Representative and its
Representatives do not and will not assume any, and do not and will not incur
any, liability whatsoever to any Securityholder or any other Person because
of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted in
connection with the Transaction Agreements that does not constitute gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud and (ii) the
Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives will be entitled to rely
on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any good faith error in judgment or
other act or omission of the Stockholders' Representative or its
Representatives pursuant to such advice will not subject the Stockholders'
Representative or its Representatives to liability to any Securityholder or
any party hereto.

  



  

(f) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Stockholders' Representative is party to this Agreement solely for
purposes of serving as the "Stockholders' Representative" and that no claim
shall be brought by or on behalf of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Merger Sub against the Stockholders' Representative with respect
to any Transaction Agreement or the Transactions except to require the
performance of its covenants expressly set forth herein (it being understood
that any covenant or agreement that requires performance by the "parties" or a
"party" at or prior to the Closing shall not be deemed to require performance
by the Stockholders' Representative unless performance by the Stockholders'
Representative is expressly provided for in such covenant or agreement).

  



  

(g) Parent and Merger Sub may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, and until the receipt of written notice of a change of
the Stockholders' Representative delivered pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , may
continue to rely, without inquiry, upon the actions of the Stockholders'
Representative as the actions of each Securityholder in all matters referred
to in this _Section 9.16_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Stockholders' Representative is party to this Agreement solely for
purposes of serving as the "Stockholders' Representative" and that no claim
shall be brought hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreement by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation against the
Stockholders' Representative or any of its Representatives, except with
respect to obligations of the Stockholders' Representative that are
expressly set forth herein or therein.

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) No later than 30 days following the Closing, the Stockholders'
Representative shall take all action reasonably required to change the entity
name of the Stockholders' Representative and to cause Sotera Equity Partners,
L.P. (" _Sotera EP_ ") to change its partnership name, in each case, to a
name that does not include "Sotera". From the Closing Date and thereafter,
the Stockholders' Representative and Sotera EP shall cease using any

shall cease to operate under an entity name, trade name or any marks or names
substantially similar or confusingly similar to, "Sotera".
