SECTION 3.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each
Company Preferred Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of Company
Ordinary Shares at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant
to the Company Charter. All of the Company Preferred Shares converted into
Company Ordinary Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Company Preferred Shares shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such securities.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of HCAC, First Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:

  



  

(i) each Company Ordinary Share (including each Company Restricted Share, and
including Company Ordinary Shares resulting from the conversion of Company
Preferred Shares described in _Section 3.01(a)_ ) that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
converted into (A) the right to receive the number of shares of HCAC Class A
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, and (B) the contingent right to
receive a number of Earnout Shares following the Closing in accordance with
_Section 3.06_ and _Annex I_ (which consideration, collectively, shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ");
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that each share of HCAC Class A Common Stock
issued in exchange for Company Restricted Shares shall be subject to the
terms and conditions giving rise to a substantial risk of forfeiture that
applied to such Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time to the extent consistent with the terms of such Company Restricted
Shares;

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(ii) each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company shall be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto;

  



  

(iii) each share of First Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

(iv) each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by HCAC and converted into (A) an option to
purchase shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Converted Option_ "),
_provided_ that the assumption and conversion of any such Company Options
that are incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code will be
effected in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the applicable
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder, and (B) the contingent right to receive a number of
Earnout Shares following the Closing in accordance with _Section 3.06_ and
_Annex I_. Each Converted Option will have and be subject to the same terms
and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable
to such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time, except that (x)
each Converted Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of HCAC
Class A Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (1) the number of shares of Company Ordinary Shares subject to the
Company Option immediately before the Effective Time and (2) the Exchange
Ratio; and (y) the per share exercise price for each share of HCAC Class A
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Converted Option will be equal to
the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1)
the exercise price per share of Company Ordinary Shares of such
Company Option immediately before the Effective Time by (2) the Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of
shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock purchasable under each Converted Option
will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder; and

  



  

(v) each award of Company RSUs that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by HCAC and converted into (A) an award of

" _Converted RSU Award_ "), and (B) the contingent right to receive a number
of Earnout Shares following the Closing in accordance with _Section 3.06_
 and _Annex I_. Each Converted RSU Award will have and be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were
applicable to such award of Company RSUs immediately before the Effective
Time, except that each Converted RSU Award will represent the right to
acquire that number of shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (1) the number of
shares of Company Ordinary Shares subject to the Company RSU
award immediately before the Effective Time and (2) the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(c) In connection with the assumption of the Converted Options and Converted
RSU Awards pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ , the Company and HCAC shall cause
HCAC to assume the Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time and subject to the prior reasonable review and approval of
HCAC (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned), the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
effect the transactions anticipated by _Section 3.01(b)_ under the Company
Option Plan and any Contract applicable to any Company Option or Company RSUs
(whether written or oral, formal or informal), including delivering all
required notices, obtaining all necessary approvals and consents, and
delivering evidence reasonably satisfactory to HCAC that all necessary
determinations by the Company Board or applicable committee of the
Company Board to assume and convert Company Options and Company RSUs in
accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ have been made.

  



  

(d) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any action on the part of HCAC, Surviving Corporation, Second Merger Sub, or
the holders of any securities of HCAC or the Surviving Corporation or the
Second Merger Sub: (a) each ordinary share of the Surviving Corporation
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor; and (b) each membership interest in Second Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership
interest in the Surviving Entity, which shall constitute the only outstanding
equity of the Surviving Entity. From and after the Second Effective Time, all
certificates, if any, representing membership interests in Second Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of membership
interests of the Surviving Entity which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

SECTION 3.02 _Exchange of Company Securities_.

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, HCAC shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be designated
by HCAC and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Ordinary Shares, for exchange
in accordance with this _Article III,_ the number of shares of HCAC Class A
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of HCAC Class A
Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). HCAC
shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay
the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with the Merger Payment Schedule and the other applicable provisions contained
in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, and in any event within two (2) Business Days following the Effective
Time (but in no event prior to the Effective Time), HCAC shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of Company Ordinary Shares, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented by book-entry
(including Company Ordinary Shares resulting from the conversion of the
Company Preferred Shares and the Company Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant),
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.01(b)(i)_ and such Company Ordinary Shares shall
forthwith be cancelled.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(c)  _No Further Rights in Company Ordinary Shares or Company Preferred
Shares_. The Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the
Company Shares (including Company Shares resulting from the conversion of the
Company Preferred Shares and the Company Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant) in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.

  



  

(d)  _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to HCAC Class A Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Ordinary Shares for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to HCAC, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Ordinary Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this _Section 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to HCAC for the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Ordinary Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of HCAC free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)  _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, HCAC, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Company
Shares (including Company Shares resulting from the conversion of the Company
Preferred Shares and the Company Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant) for any
such Company Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law in accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(g)  _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Surviving Corporation, Surviving Entity, HCAC, First
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts (including shares, options or other
property) otherwise payable, issuable or transferable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Shares
(including Company Shares resulting from the conversion of the Company
Preferred Shares and the Company Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant) such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment, issuance or transfer under the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or non U.S. Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid, issued or transferred to the holder of the
Company Securities (or intended recipients of compensatory payments) in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(h)  _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the
exchange of Company Shares and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
HCAC or a holder of shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock. In lieu of any
fractional share of HCAC Class A Common Stock to which any holder of Company
Shares would otherwise be entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down
to the nearest whole share of HCAC Class A Common Stock, as applicable, with a
fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements shall be made with respect to
fractional shares eliminated by rounding.

  



  

(i)  _Merger Payment Schedule_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to HCAC and the Exchange Agent a
schedule (the " _Merger Payment Schedule_ ") showing the percentage allocation
of the Company Merger Shares to each of the holders of Company Securities at
the Closing (such holder's " _Pro Rata Share_ ") as well as the corresponding
number of shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock to be issued to such holders of
Company Securities pursuant to _Section 3.01_.

  



  

SECTION 3.03 _Register of Members_. At the Effective Time, the register of
members of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Shares thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

SECTION 3.04 _Payment of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) No sooner than five (5) nor later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide to HCAC a written report setting
forth a list of all of the following fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation and

immediately preceding the Closing Date: (i) the fees and disbursements of
outside counsel to the Company incurred in connection with the Transactions
and (ii) the fees and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants,

forth a list of all fees, expenses and disbursements incurred by or on behalf
of HCAC, First Merger Sub, or Second Merger Sub for outside counsel, agents,
advisors, consultants, experts, financial advisors and other service
providers engaged by or on behalf of HCAC, First Merger Sub or Second Merger
Sub in connection with the Transactions or otherwise in connection with
HCAC's operations (together with written invoices and wire transfer
instructions for the payment thereof) (collectively, the " _Outstanding HCAC
Transaction Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date, HCAC shall pay or cause to be
paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all such Outstanding
HCAC Transaction Expenses.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.04_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated, except that the
Company shall pay all filing fees relating to all SEC and other regulatory
filing fees (including those incurred in connection with the Proxy Statement
and the filing fee for the Notification and Report Forms filed under the HSR
Act).

  



  

(d) HCAC shall not be required to pay or cause to be paid any Outstanding
HCAC Transaction Expenses or Outstanding Company Transaction Expenses other
than in accordance with this _Section 3.04_.

  



  

SECTION 3.05 _Dissenters ' Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the CCC and Cayman Companies Law, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by shareholders of the Company who shall have demanded properly in writing
dissenters' rights for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 238 of
the Cayman Companies Law or, to the extent applicable, Chapter 13 of the CCC,
and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the Cayman Companies Law
relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights, or, to the
extent applicable, complied with all of the provisions of the CCC relevant to
the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such stockholders
shall have no right to receive, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses his, her or its right to dissenters' rights under the Cayman Companies
Law, or, to the extent applicable, the CCC. Any stockholder of the Company
who fails to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her
or its dissenters' rights pursuant to the Cayman Companies Law, or, to the
extent applicable, Chapter 13 or the CCC, shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give HCAC (i) prompt notice of
any demands for dissenters' rights received by the Company and any
withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters' rights
under the Cayman Companies Law, or, to the extent applicable, CCC. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of HCAC (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to
any demands for dissenters' rights or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing

have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Open Source Software or any modification or derivative thereof (i) in a

(h) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries owns, leases, licenses, or
otherwise has the legal right to use all Business Systems, and such Business
Systems are sufficient in all material respects for the current needs of the
business of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as currently
conducted by the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and each

security safeguards designed to protect the security and integrity of the
Business Systems constituting Company Owned IP and any Personal Information.
The Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' employees and contractors receive
commercially reasonable training on information security issues. To the

Formation Date, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
liability material to the Company or Company Subsidiary, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has (i) to the Company's knowledge,

or use of any Personal Information or Business Data; or (ii) to the
Company's knowledge, been subject to or received written notice of any
audits, proceedings or investigations by any Governmental Authority or any
customer, or received any material claims or complaints regarding the
collection, dissemination, storage or use of Personal Information, or the
violation of any applicable Data Security Requirements.

Company Subsidiaries are not subject to any material legal obligations,
including based on the Transactions contemplated hereunder, that would
prohibit First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or HCAC from receiving or using
Personal Information after the Closing Date, in a similar manner in which the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries receive and use such Personal
Information immediately prior to the Closing Date or result in material
liabilities in connection with Data Security Requirements.

a member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or
similar standard setting organization that could require or obligate the

SECTION 5.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

  



  

(a) HCAC has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since February 28,
2019, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto
(collectively, the " _HCAC SEC Reports_ "). HCAC has heretofore furnished
to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and modifications
that have not been filed by HCAC with the SEC to all agreements, documents
and other instruments that previously had been filed by HCAC with the SEC and
are currently in effect. As of their respective dates, the HCAC SEC Reports
(i) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "),
and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date
of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each director and executive officer of
HCAC has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with
respect to HCAC by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the HCAC SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows of HCAC as at the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate be material). HCAC has no off-balance sheet arrangements that
are not disclosed in the HCAC SEC Reports. No financial statements other than
those of HCAC are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of HCAC.

  



  

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the HCAC SEC Reports, neither
HCAC, First Merger Sub nor Second Merger Sub has any liability or obligation
of a nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to
be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for
liabilities and obligations arising in the ordinary course of HCAC's, First
Merger Sub's and Second Merger Sub's business.

listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Capital
Market.

  



  

(e) HCAC has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as

procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to HCAC
and other material information required to be disclosed by HCAC in the
reports and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to HCAC's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting HCAC's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in HCAC's periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(f) HCAC maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that
are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that HCAC maintains records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material
respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. HCAC has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten,
a summary thereof) by any representative of HCAC to HCAC's independent
auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls and any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that
would adversely affect the ability of HCAC to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. HCAC has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-blower
allegations, whether or not material, that involve management or other
employees or consultants who have or had a significant role in the
internal control over financial reporting of HCAC. Since March 31, 2020,
there have been no material changes in HCAC internal control over financial
reporting.

  



  

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by HCAC
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of HCAC and HCAC has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(h) Neither HCAC (including any employee thereof) nor HCAC's independent
auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency
or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls utilized by
HCAC, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves HCAC's
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by HCAC or
(iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

  



  

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC
with respect to the HCAC SEC Reports. To the knowledge of HCAC, none of the
HCAC SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing
SEC review or investigation as of the date hereof.

  



  

SECTION 5.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2019,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (a) HCAC has conducted
its business in all material respects in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practice, other than due to any actions taken due to a
"shelter in place," "non-essential employee" or similar direction of any
Governmental Authority, (b) there has not been any HCAC Material Adverse
Effect, and (c) HCAC has not taken any action that, if taken after the date
of this Agreement, would constitute a material breach of any of the covenants
set forth in Section 6.02.

  



  

SECTION 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of HCAC, threatened against HCAC, or any property or asset of HCAC,
before any Governmental Authority. Neither HCAC nor any material property or
asset of HCAC is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the
knowledge of HCAC, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority,
or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of
any Governmental Authority.

SECTION 5.13 _HCAC Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, HCAC has no
less than $308,737,340 in the trust fund established by HCAC for the benefit
of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ") maintained in a trust
account (the " _Trust Account_ "). The monies of such Trust Account are
invested in United States Government securities or money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2019, between HCAC and the Trustee (the "
_Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified
and is valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions. HCAC has complied in all
material respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach
thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust
Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default by HCAC or the Trustee. There are no
separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between HCAC and the Trustee
that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the HCAC SEC
Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of
HCAC, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of HCAC who shall
have elected to redeem their shares of HCAC Class A Common Stock pursuant to
the HCAC Organizational Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise Taxes from
any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of
Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the HCAC
Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of HCAC, threatened in writing with respect to
the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the Mergers and notice thereof to the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, HCAC shall cause the Trustee to, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to HCAC as promptly as
practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which
point the Trust Account shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
liabilities and obligations of HCAC due and owing or incurred at or prior to
the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts
payable (a) to stockholders of HCAC who shall have exercised their Redemption
Rights and (b) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with
the Trust Agreement. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance
by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, HCAC has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to HCAC at the Effective Time.

or retained any contractors. Other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by HCAC's officers and directors in connection with
activities on HCAC's behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the
amount of cash held by HCAC outside of the Trust Account, HCAC has no
unsatisfied material liability with respect to any officer or director. HCAC,

maintain, sponsor, or contribute to or have any direct or material liability
under any Employee Benefit Plan.

SECTION 6.03 _Claims Against Trust Account_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of HCAC, dated as of February 28, 2019 and filed with the SEC
(File No. 333- 229608) on March 4, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company
hereby represents and warrants that it has read the Prospectus and
understands that HCAC has established the Trust Account containing the
proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and the overallotment
shares acquired by its underwriters and from certain private placements
occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to
time thereon) for the benefit of HCAC's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by HCAC's underwriters the " _Public
Stockholders_ "), and that, except as otherwise described in the Prospectus,
HCAC may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the
Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their HCAC Class A
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of HCAC's initial business
combination (as such term is used in the Prospectus) (the " _Business
Combination_ ") or in connection with an extension of its deadline to
consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if HCAC
fails to consummate a Business Combination within eighteen (18) months after
the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect to any interest earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any Taxes, or (d)
to HCAC after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business
Combination. For and in consideration of HCAC entering into this Agreement,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself
and its affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates do now or shall at
any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any
claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom),
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or
relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business
relationship between HCAC or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any
other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively
referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of
itself and its affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that
the Company or any of its affiliates may have against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with HCAC or its
Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including
for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with HCAC or
its affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable
waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by HCAC and
its affiliates to induce HCAC to enter in this Agreement, and the Company
further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable against the Company and each of its affiliates under
applicable Law. To the extent the Company or any of its affiliates commences
any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to HCAC or its Representatives, which
proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against HCAC or its
Representatives, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company's
and its affiliates' sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the
Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit the Company or its
affiliates (or any person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of any
of them) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In the event the
Company or any of its affiliates commences any action or proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
HCAC or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or
the Public Stockholders of HCAC, whether in the form of money damages or
injunctive relief, HCAC and its Representatives, as applicable, shall be
entitled to recover from the Company and its affiliates the associated legal
fees and costs in connection with any such action, in the event HCAC or its
Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such action or proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of
this paragraph shall survive indefinitely with respect to the obligations set
forth in this Agreement.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and

the other party (and the other party's officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access at reasonable times
upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of such party and its subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other party such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of such party and its subsidiaries as the other
party or its Representatives may reasonably request, including in connection
with any Tax disclosure in any statement, filing, notice or application
relating to the Intended Tax Treatment or any Tax opinion requested or
required to be filed pursuant to _Section 7.11(c)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor HCAC shall be required to provide access to
or disclose information where the access or disclosure would jeopardize the
protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene applicable Law (it
being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in
such jeopardy or contravention).

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(b) All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this _Section 7.04_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the non-disclosure agreement,
dated as of June 30, 2020 (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "), between HCAC
and the Company.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
(and its respective Representatives) may consult any Tax advisor as is
reasonably necessary regarding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transactions and may disclose to such advisor as reasonably necessary, the
intended Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Transactions and all materials
(including any Tax analysis) that are provided relating to such treatment or
structure, in each case in accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 7.05 _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement and ending on the
earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement, but
only, in the case of HCAC, except to the extent it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the HCAC Board,
the parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
enter into, knowingly solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or
negotiations with, or knowingly encourage or respond to any inquiries or
proposals by, or participate in any negotiations with, or provide any
information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person or other
entity or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
concerning any sale of any material assets of such party or any of the
outstanding capital stock or any conversion, consolidation,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving such party or any
of such party's Subsidiaries other than with the other parties to this
Agreement and their respective Representatives (an " _Alternative Transaction_
"), (ii) enter into any agreement regarding, continue or otherwise knowingly
participate in any discussions regarding, or furnish to any person
any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way that would otherwise
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction or (iii)
commence, continue or renew any due diligence investigation regarding any
Alternative Transaction; _provided_  that the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed a
violation of this _Section 7.05_. Each party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
person conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction. Each
party also agrees that it will promptly request each person (other than the
parties hereto and their respective Representatives) that has prior to the
date hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an Alternative Transaction to return or destroy all
Confidential Information furnished to such person by or on behalf of it prior
to the date hereof (to the extent so permitted under, and in accordance with
the terms of, such confidentiality agreement). If a party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives receives any
inquiry or proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction at any time
prior to the Closing, then such party shall promptly (and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after such party becomes aware of such inquiry or
proposal) notify such person in writing that such party is subject to an
exclusivity agreement with respect to the Transaction that prohibits such
party from considering such inquiry or proposal, but only, in the case of
HCAC, except to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the HCAC Board. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 7.05_ by a party or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective affiliates or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 7.05_ by such party.

SECTION 7.06 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) HCAC shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of its
subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and determining the level of benefits, as applicable,
under any Employee Benefit Plan established or maintained by the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries (excluding any retiree health plans or
programs or defined benefit retirement plans or programs) for service accrued
or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In
addition, HCAC shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause to be waived
any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under each of the
Employee Benefit Plans established or maintained by the Surviving Entity or
any of its subsidiaries that cover the Continuing Employees or their
dependents, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, during the portion of the plan
year in which the Closing occurs, under those health and welfare benefit
plans in which such Continuing Employee currently participates to be taken
into account under those health and welfare benefit plans in which such
Continuing Employee participates subsequent to the Closing Date for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year. Following the Closing, the Surviving
Entity will honor all accrued but unused vacation and other paid time off of
the Continuing Employees that existed immediately prior to the Closing with
respect to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. As a condition to
HCAC's obligations under this _Section 7.06(a)_ , the Company shall provide
HCAC or its designee with all information reasonably requested and necessary
to allow HCAC or its designee to comply with such obligations.

  



  

(b) The Company shall cause all notices to be timely provided to each
optionee under the Company Stock Option Plan as required by the Company Stock
Option Plan.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Agreement, and nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or legal representative or
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person, any rights or remedies
of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement,
whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, including, without
limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, or level of compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an amendment or modification
of any Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement or shall
require the Company, HCAC, the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries to
continue any Plan or other employee benefit arrangements, or prevent their
amendment, modification or termination.

SECTION 7.07 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Corporation
and the operating agreement of the Surviving Entity shall each contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement or
expense reimbursement than are set forth in the Company Charter, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
the Company, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law.
From and after the Effective Time, HCAC agrees that it shall indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable
Law, the Company Charter in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). HCAC further agrees that with respect
to the provisions of the bylaws or limited liability company agreements of the
Company Subsidiaries relating to indemnification, advancement or expense
reimbursement, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of such Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required
by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof, and for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, HCAC shall maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (true, correct and
complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to HCAC or its
agents or Representatives in the Virtual Data Room) on terms not less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in
no event shall HCAC be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for
such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) HCAC may cause
coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms
not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time so long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made
within such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained under
this  _Section 7.07(b)_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the
final disposition thereof.

  



  

(c) On the Closing Date, to the extent not already entered into, HCAC shall
enter into customary indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to
each of the Company and HCAC with the post-Closing directors and officers of
HCAC, which indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective
following the Closing.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

SECTION 7.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to HCAC, and HCAC shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
any event which a party becomes aware of between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article IX_), the occurrence, or non-occurrence of which causes or
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ to fail.

  



  

SECTION 7.09 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as
are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise, and
each shall cooperate with the other, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including, without limitation, using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of, and the expiration or termination of waiting
periods by, Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section 4.05_ necessary
for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the
Mergers. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each party shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all such action.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other
parties of any communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permitting the other parties to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No party
to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, video or
telephone conference, or other communications with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting, conference or other communications. Subject to
the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing. Subject to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
parties will provide each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications, including any documents, information and data
contained therewith, between them or any of their Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall take or
cause to be taken any action before any Governmental Authority that is
inconsistent with or intended to delay its action on requests for a consent or
the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, HCAC shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Private Placements in accordance
with the Subscription Agreements, and the Company shall cooperate with HCAC in
such efforts. HCAC shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification
to any Subscription Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause the
condition set forth in _Section 8.01(f)_ to fail.

this Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_) unless otherwise prohibited by
applicable Law or the requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, each of HCAC
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior written consent of the other party.
Furthermore, nothing contained in this _Section 7.10_ shall prevent HCAC or
the Company or its respective affiliates from furnishing customary or other
reasonable information concerning the Transactions to their investors and
prospective investors that is substantively consistent with public statements
previously consented to by the other party in accordance with this _Section
7.10_.

  



  

SECTION 7.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) None of HCAC, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or the Company shall
(and each shall cause its affiliates not to) take any action (or fail to take
any reasonable action) which action (or failure to act), whether before or
after the Effective Time, would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of HCAC, First
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the Company shall report the Mergers, taken
together, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing if, before
the Closing Date, such party knows or has reason to believe that the Merger
may not qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment (and whether the terms of this
Agreement could be reasonably amended in order to facilitate the Merger
qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment). In the event either HCAC or the
Company seeks a tax opinion from its respective tax advisor regarding the
Intended Tax Treatment, or the SEC requests or requires tax opinions, each
party shall use reasonable efforts to execute and deliver customary tax
representation letters to the applicable tax advisor in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such advisor.

  



  

SECTION 7.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. HCAC will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the HCAC Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the

the U.S. Federal Trade Commission a Notification and Report Form as required
by the HSR Act. The parties hereto agree to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may
reasonably be requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods or obtain required approvals, as applicable
under Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, including by requesting early
termination of the waiting period provided for under the HSR Act.

  



  

(b) HCAC and the Company each shall, in connection with its efforts to obtain
all requisite approvals and expiration or termination of waiting periods for
the Transactions under any Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to:
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other party or its affiliates in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private person; (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private person, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions, and promptly furnish the other with copies of all such written
communications; (iii) permit the other to review in advance any written
communication to be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private person, with any other person, and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or other person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences; (iv) in the event a party is prohibited from participating in or
attending any meetings or conferences, the other shall keep such
party promptly and reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (v) use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument, or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority;  _provided_ that materials required to be provided pursuant to
this Section 7.13(b) may be limited to outside counsel and may be redacted
(i) to remove references to the valuation of the Company, and (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements.

  



  

(c) No party hereto shall take any action that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect or materially delay the approval of any Governmental
Authority, or the expiration or termination of any waiting period of any
required filings or applications under Antitrust Laws, including by agreeing
to merge with or acquire any other person or acquire a substantial portion of
the assets of or equity in any other person. The parties hereto further
covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the Transactions, to use reasonable best efforts to

for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons).

  



  

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to

Merger Sub. All legal actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to

jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect to their
respective properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence
any Action relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware

the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

SECTION 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have
been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as

other Transaction Document may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery by email
to counsel for the other parties of a counterpart executed by a party shall
be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

  



  

SECTION 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties' obligation to consummate the
Merger) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court
does not have jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the
State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as
expressly permitted in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security
or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

SECTION 10.11 _No Recourse_. Except in the case of fraud, all actions,
claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of actions (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement,
(b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement), (c) any breach of this Agreement and (d) any
failure of the Merger to be consummated, may be made only against
(and, without prejudice to the rights of any express third party beneficiary
to whom rights under this Agreement inure pursuant to _Section 10.11_), are
those solely of the persons that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement and not against any Nonparty Affiliate (as defined below). Except
in the case of fraud, no other person, including any director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, optionholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or
lender to, any party to this Agreement, or any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to (each of
the foregoing, a " _Nonparty Affiliate_ ") any of the foregoing shall have
any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil) for any claims,
causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in
connection with or related in any manner to the items in the
immediately preceding _clauses (a)_ through _(d)_ and each party, on behalf
of itself and its affiliates, hereby irrevocably releases and forever
discharges each of the Nonparty Affiliate from any such liability or
obligation.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Sidley Austin LLP ("
_Sidley_ ") and Ellenoff Grossman and Schole LLP (" _EGS_ ") has each acted as
legal counsel to HCAC, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Sponsor,
certain HCAC security holders and certain of their respective affiliates
prior to the Closing, and that Sidley and EGS may act as legal counsel to
HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Entity and one or more of
its subsidiaries, Sponsor, certain HCAC security holders and certain of their
respective affiliates after the Closing, each of HCAC and the Surviving
Corporation (including on behalf of the Surviving Corporation's subsidiaries)
hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with each of Sidley's and EGS'
representing HCAC, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, Sponsor, any
HCAC security holder and any of their respective Affiliates after to the
Closing. In addition, all communications involving attorney-
client confidences by or among HCAC, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub,
Sponsor, HCAC security holders or their respective affiliates in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Sponsor, such HCAC security holder or such affiliate (and not
to HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of its
subsidiaries). Accordingly, HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Sidley or EGS relating to such engagement,
whether or not the Closing will have occurred. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Sponsor or the applicable
HCAC security holder and its affiliates (and not HCAC, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries) will be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to
such engagement, and none of HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity and its subsidiaries will be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that
files of each of Sidley and EGS in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only Sponsor, the applicable HCAC security holder or
their respective affiliates (and not HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries) will hold such property rights
and (iii) each of Sidley and EGS will have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to HCAC after the
Closing and before or after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Sidley and EGS (as applicable) and HCAC, First Merger
Sub, and Second Merger Sub before the Closing and after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and any of its subsidiaries or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of its
subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any
of their respective affiliates) after the Closing, HCAC, the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity (including on behalf of its
subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by Sidley and EGS to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither HCAC, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity nor any of its subsidiaries may waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Sponsor.

"); _provided_ , that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the filing deadline if the
Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives comments from, the
Commission. The Registration Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to
this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall be a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (a
" _Form S-3 Shelf_ ") or, if Form S-3 is not then available to the Company,
on Form S-1 (a " _Form S-1 Registration Statement_ ") or such other form of
registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for
resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such Registrable Securities,
and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell
such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at any time beginning on the
effective date for such Registration Statement. A Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall provide for the
resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to,
and requested prior to effectiveness by, the Holders. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant
to this _subsection 2.1.1_ to remain effective, and to be supplemented and
amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is
available or, if not available, that another Registration Statement is
available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the
Holders until all such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities. When effective, a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_subsection 2.1.1 _ (including the documents incorporated therein by
reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus contained in
such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which
such statement is made).

  



  

2.1.2 _Form S-3 Shelf_. If the Company files a Form S-3 Shelf and thereafter
the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a Form S-1 Registration
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable to replace the shelf
registration statement that is a Form S-3 Shelf and have the Form S-1
Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to cause such Form S-1 Registration Statement to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such
Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.

2.1.3 Underwritten Offering. At any time and from time to time following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement required by subsection 2.1.1 or
2.1.2, any Holder may request to sell all or a portion of their Registrable
Securities (a " _Demanding Holder_ ") in an underwritten offering that is
registered pursuant to such Registration Statement (an " _Underwritten Demand_
"),  _provided_ that such Holder(s) (a) reasonably expect aggregate gross
proceeds in excess of $50,000,000 from such Underwritten Offering or (b)
reasonably expects to sell all of the Registrable Securities held by such
Holder in such Underwritten Offering but in no event less than $10,000,000 in
aggregate gross proceeds. All requests for an Underwritten Offering shall be
made by giving written notice to the Company (the " _Underwritten Demand
Notice_ "). Each Underwritten Demand Notice shall specify the approximate
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Underwritten
Offering and the expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and
commissions) of such Underwritten Offering. Within five (5) business days
after receipt of any Underwritten Demand Notice, the Company shall give
written notice of such requested Underwritten Offering (the " _Company
Underwritten Demand Notice_ ") to all other Holders of Registrable Securities
(the " _Requesting Holders_ ") and, subject to reductions consistent with the
Pro Rata calculations in Section 2.1.5, shall include in such Underwritten
Offering all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has
received written requests for inclusion therein, within five (5) days after
sending the Company Underwritten Demand Notice. The Company shall enter into
an underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings
of securities by the Company with the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters selected by the initiating Demanding Holders with the written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) and shall take all such other reasonable actions as are
requested by the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. In connection with
any Underwritten Offering contemplated by this subsection 2.1.3, subject to
Section 3.3 and Article IV, the underwriting agreement into which each Holder
and the Company shall enter shall contain such representations, covenants,
indemnities and other rights and obligations of the Company and such Holders
as are customary in underwritten offerings of securities. Under no
circumstances shall the Company be obligated to effect (x) more than an
aggregate of three (3) Underwritten Offerings pursuant to an Underwritten
Demand by the Holders under this subsection 2.1.3 with respect to any or all
Registrable Securities held by such Holders and (y) more than two (2)
Underwritten Offerings per year pursuant to this subsection 2.1.3; _provided_
, _however_ , that an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an Underwritten
Demand shall not be counted for such purposes unless a Registration Statement
that may be available at such time has become effective and all of the
Registrable Securities requested by the Requesting Holders and the Demanding
Holders to be registered on behalf of the Requesting Holders and the Demanding
Holders in such Registration Statement have been sold, in accordance with
Section 3.1 of this Agreement.

  



  

2.1.4 _Holder Information Required for Participation in Underwritten
Offering_. At least ten (10) business days prior to the first
anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Article
II_ , the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to notify each Holder in
writing (which may be by email) of the information reasonably necessary about
the Holder to include such Holder's Registrable Securities in such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be obligated to include such Holder's Registrable
Securities to the extent the Company has not received such information, and
received any other reasonably requested agreements or certificates, on or
prior to the fifth business day prior to the first anticipated filing date of
a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

   

A-8

 



    



  

2.1.5 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering, in good faith, advises the Company,
the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the
dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders
and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all
other Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to
sell and the Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights held by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum
dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering
price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success
of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such
securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the
Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first,
the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders (pro rata based on the
respective number of Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder has
requested be included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders have requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration (such proportion is referred to
herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the
Registrable Securities of Requesting Holders (Pro Rata, based on the
respective number of Registrable Securities that each Requesting Holder has so
requested) exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities
pursuant to _subsection 2.1.3_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the

Demanding Holders initiating an Underwritten Demand or a majority-in-
interest of the Requesting Holders (if any), pursuant to a Registration under
_subsection 2.1.3_ shall have the right to withdraw from a Registration
pursuant to an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _subsection 2.1.3_ for any or
no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of their intention to withdraw from such
Registration at least five (5) business days prior to the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to the
Registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to such Underwritten
Offering (or in the case of an Underwritten Registration pursuant to Rule
415, at least five (5) business days prior to the time of pricing of the
applicable offering). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with a Registration pursuant to an Underwritten
Offering prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.6_.

  



  

2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of
equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, for its own account
or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by
the stockholders of the Company, including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for a
rights offering or an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the
Company's existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is
convertible into equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend
reinvestment plan, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed

securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of the Holders
of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale of such number
of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing within five
(5) days after receipt of such written notice (such Registration a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good faith, cause
such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this _subsection 2.2.1_ to
be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities of the Company included in such Registration and to
permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such
Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

  



  

   

A-9

 



    



  

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a
Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of the shares of Common Stock that the
Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock,
if any, as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder (ii) the Registrable
Securities as to which registration has been requested pursuant to _Section
2.2_ hereof, and (iii) the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which

exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to  _subsection

stockholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities;

  



  

(b) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities other

Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_, Pro Rata, which can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other equity
securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D) fourth, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (A), (B) and (C), the Common Stock or other equity securities for the
account of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register
pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or
entities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration at least five (5) business days prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Piggyback Registration (or in the case of an
Underwritten Registration pursuant to Rule 415, at least five (5) business
days prior to the time of pricing of the applicable offering). The Company
(whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a request for
withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations)
may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection
with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

  



  

   

A-10

 



    



  

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof shall not be counted
as a Registration pursuant to an Underwritten Offering effected under
_subsection 2.1.3_.

  



  

2.3 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to (but may, at
its sole option) (A) effect an Underwritten Offering (i) within sixty (60)
days after the closing of an Underwritten Offering or (ii) during the period
starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good faith
estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to
the Holders prior to receipt of an Underwritten Demand pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.3_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all
reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to
become effective or (B) file a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or effect an Underwritten Offering (or, if the Company has filed a
shelf Registration Statement and has included Registrable Securities therein,
the Company shall be entitled to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) for a period of up to
forty-five (45) days (i) if the Holders have requested an Underwritten Demand
and the Company and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of
Underwriters to firmly underwrite the offer; or (ii) in the good faith
judgment of the Board such Underwritten Offering would be materially
detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a result that it is
essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement at such time,
_provided_ that in each case of (i) and (ii) the Company shall furnish to
such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in
the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially detrimental to
the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the near future and
that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration
Statement and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not defer its
obligation in this manner more than once in any 12 month period.

  



  

2.4 _Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless the Company is notified in writing to the contrary by the
Anchor Investor, (A) each Anchor Investor hereby waives any and all rights
(i) to receive notice of any Underwritten Offering as provided for in this
_Section 2_ or (ii) to participate in any such Underwritten Offering, and (B)
the Company hereby agrees not to notify any Anchor Investor of any
Underwritten Offering or provide any Anchor Investor with any information
relating thereto.

majority-in-interest of the participating Holders;

  



  

3.1.12 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant

entity may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder

Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that the
Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as
soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in
respect of any Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company
for reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the
shortest period of time, but in no event more than forty-five (45) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in
connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Company
shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during
which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

  



  

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of
the Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144,
including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the
Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly
authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

  



  

   

A-14

 



    



  

3.6 _Lock-Up Restrictions_.

  



  

3.6.1 During the applicable Lock-Up Periods, none of the Existing Holders
shall offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase,
make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or distribute any shares of Common
Stock that are subject to an applicable Lock-Up Period or any securities
convertible into, exercisable for, exchangeable for or that represent the
right to receive shares of Common Stock that are subject to an applicable
Lock-Up Period, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, that is owned
directly by such Existing Holder (including securities held as a custodian)
or with respect to which such Existing Holder has beneficial ownership within
the rules and regulations of the Commission (such securities that are subject
to an applicable Lock-Up Period, the " _Restricted Securities_ "), other than
any transfer to an affiliate of an Existing Holder or to a Permitted
Transferee, as applicable. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to
preclude each Existing Holder, as applicable, from engaging in any hedging or
other transaction with respect to Restricted Securities which is designed to
or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or
disposition of the Restricted Securities even if such Restricted
Securities would be disposed of by someone other than such Existing Holder.
Such prohibited hedging or other transactions include any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including any put or call option) with
respect to any of the Restricted Securities of the applicable Existing
Holder, or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives
any significant part of its value from such Restricted Securities.

  



  

3.6.2 Each Existing Holder hereby represents and warrants that it now has
and, except as contemplated by this _subsection 3.6.2_ for the duration of
the applicable Lock-Up Period, will have good and marketable title to its
Restricted Securities, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims
that could impact the ability of such Existing Holder to comply with the
foregoing restrictions Each Existing Holder agrees and consents to the entry
of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar
against the transfer of any Restricted Securities during the applicable Lock-
Up Period.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused
by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls
such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same
extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of
the Holder.

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; The Holders of Registrable Securities shall
indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who
controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the
same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to indemnify
under this _Section 4.1.2_ shall be several, not joint and several, among the
Holders of Registrable Securities, and the total liability of a Holder under
this _Section 4.1.2_ shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds
received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement.

  



  

   

A-15

 



    



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5 _shall be limited
to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering
giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by Pro
Rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Re: Lock-Up Agreement

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter agreement (this " _Letter Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you
in accordance with the Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") entered into by and among Canoo Inc., a
Delaware corporation f/k/a Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (the "
_Company_ "), HCAC IV First Merger Sub, Ltd., an exempted company
incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a direct, wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company (" _First Merger Sub_ "), HCAC IV Second
Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Second Merger Sub_ "), and Canoo Holdings
Ltd., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman
Islands (" _Canoo_ "), pursuant to which, through a series of mergers at the
Closing with HCAC IV First Merger Sub, Ltd. and HCAC IV Second Merger Sub,
LLC, Canoo will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Capitalized
terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

In order to induce the Company to proceed with the Transactions and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the undersigned (the " _Securityholder_ ") hereby agrees
with the Company as follows:

  



  

1. Subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not
to, without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the
Company, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate,
pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to
dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent
position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the
meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
" _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, any shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Common Stock_ ") held by it
immediately after the Closing, any shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of options to purchase shares of Common Stock held by it immediately
after the Closing, or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock held by it immediately after the Closing, (ii)
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such
shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled
by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly
announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or
(ii) (the actions specified in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, " _Transfer_
") until 180 days after the Closing (the " _Lock-up_ ").

  



  

2. The restrictions set forth in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:

  



       | (i)  | in the case of an entity, Transfers to a
stockholder, partner, member or affiliate of such entity; 
---|---|--- 
    



  

   

B-1

 



    



       | (ii)  | in the case of an individual, Transfers by gift to
members of the individual's immediate family (as defined below) or to a
trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of one of the individual's
immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (iii)  | in the case of an individual, Transfers by virtue
of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (iv)  | in the case of an individual, Transfers pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (v)  | in the case of an entity, Transfers by virtue of
the laws of the state of the entity's organization and the entity's
organizational documents upon dissolution of the entity; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (vi)  | transactions relating to Common Stock or other
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock
acquired in open market transactions after the Closing, _provided _ that no
such transaction is required to be, or is, publicly announced (whether on Form
4, Form 5 or otherwise, other than a required filing on Schedule 13F, 13G or
13G/A) during the Lock-Up; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (vii)  | the exercise of any options or warrants to
purchase Common Stock (which exercises may be effected on a cashless basis to
the extent the instruments representing such options or warrants permit
exercises on a cashless basis); 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (viii)  | Transfers to the Company to satisfy tax
withholding obligations pursuant to the Company's equity incentive plans or
arrangements; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (ix)  | Transfers to the Company pursuant to any
contractual arrangement in effect at the Closing that provides for the
repurchase by the Company or forfeiture of the Securityholder's Common Stock
or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Stock in connection with the termination of the Securityholder's service to
the Company; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (x)  | the entry, by the Securityholder, at any time
after the Closing, of any trading plan providing for the sale of Common Stock
by the Securityholder, which trading plan meets the requirements of Rule
10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that such plan does
not provide for, or permit, the sale of any Common Stock during the Lock-Up
and no public announcement or filing is voluntarily made or required regarding
such plan during the Lock-Up; 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (xi)  | transactions in the event of completion of a
liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which
results in all of the Company's securityholders having the right to exchange
their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other property; and 
---|---|--- 
    



       | (xii)  | transactions to satisfy any U.S. federal, state,
or local income tax obligations of the Securityholder (or its direct or
indirect owners) arising from a change in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Regulations_ ") after the date on which the
Merger Agreement was executed by the parties, and such change prevents the
Transactions from qualifying as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368 of
the Code (and the Transactions do not qualify for similar tax-free treatment
pursuant to any successor or other provision of the Code or
Regulations taking into account such changes). 
---|---|--- 
    



  

   

B-2

 



    



  

 _provided, however_ , that in the case of clauses (i) through (v), these
permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in substantially
the form of this Letter Agreement (it being understood that any references to
"immediate family" in the agreement executed by such transferee shall
expressly refer only to the immediate family of the Securityholder and not
to the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family"
shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild or other lineal
descendant (including by adoption), father, mother, brother or sister of the
Securityholder; and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

3. The Securityholder hereby represents and warrants that such Securityholder
has full power and authority to enter into this Letter Agreement and that
this Letter Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Securityholder, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Upon request,
the Securityholder will execute any additional documents necessary in
connection with enforcement hereof. Any obligations of the Securityholder
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Securityholder from
and after the date hereof.

  



  

4. This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the
parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the
subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter
Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to
correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a
written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

  



  

5. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph
shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any
interest or title to the purported assignee. This Letter Agreement shall be
binding on the Securityholder and each of its respective successors, heirs
and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

6. This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the
substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) all agree
that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in
any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in any
Delaware Chancery Court, and irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction
and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waive any
objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts
represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

7. This Letter Agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the Lock-up.

   | 4.1| For the purpose of determining Members entitled to notice of,
or to vote at any meeting of Members or any adjournment thereof, or Members
entitled to receive payment of any Dividend, or in order to make a
determination of Members for any other purpose, the Directors may provide that
the Register of Members shall be closed for transfers for a stated period
which shall not in any case exceed forty days. If the Register of Members

---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.2| In lieu of, or apart from, closing the Register of Members, the

is fixed for the determination of Members entitled to notice of, or to vote
at, a meeting of Members or Members entitled to receive payment of a
Dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which
the resolution of the Directors declaring such Dividend is adopted, as the

adjournment thereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5| Certificates for Shares 
---|---|---

Directors resolve that share certificates shall be issued. Share certificates
representing Shares, if any, shall be in such form as the Directors may
determine. Share certificates shall be signed by one or more Directors or
other person authorised by the Directors. The Directors may authorise
certificates to be issued with the authorised signature(s) affixed by
mechanical process. All certificates for Shares shall be consecutively
numbered or otherwise identified and shall specify the Shares to which they
relate. All certificates surrendered to the Company for transfer shall be
cancelled and subject to these Articles no new certificate shall be issued
until the former certificate representing a like number of relevant Shares
shall have been surrendered and cancelled. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-5

 



    



   | 5.2| The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one
certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a
certificate to one joint holder shall be a sufficient delivery to all of
them. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3| If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed,
it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and on
the payment of such expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in
investigating evidence, as the Directors may prescribe, and (in the case of
defacement or wearing out) upon delivery of the old certificate. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6| Transfer of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.1| Shares are transferable subject to the consent of the Directors
who may, in their absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of
Shares without giving any reason. If the Directors refuse to register a
transfer they shall notify the transferee within two months of such refusal. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.2| The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in writing and
shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor (and if the Directors so
require, signed by the transferee). The transferor shall be deemed to remain
the holder of a Share until the name of the transferee is entered in the
Register of Members. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7| Redemption and Repurchase of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1| Subject to the provisions of the Statute the Company may issue
Shares that are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the option of
the Member or the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.2| Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Company may
redeem its own Shares or purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable
Shares) provided that the Members shall have approved the manner and terms of
the redemption or purchase by Ordinary Resolution or as determined by a
resolution of the Directors. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3| The Company may make a payment in respect of the redemption or
purchase of its own Shares in any manner permitted by the Statute, including
out of capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8| Treasury Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.1| The Directors may, prior to the purchase, redemption or
surrender of any Share, determine that such Share shall be held as a Treasury
Share. 
---|---|---

transfer a Treasury Share on such terms as they think proper (including,
without limitation, for nil consideration). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9| Variation of Rights of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.1| If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into
different classes of Shares, the rights attached to any class (unless
otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may,
whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in
writing of the holders of three-quarters of the issued Shares of that class,
or with the sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a general meeting of
the holders of the Shares of that class. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-6

 



    



   | 9.2| The provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings
shall apply to every class meeting of the holders of one class of Shares
except that the necessary quorum shall be one person holding or representing
by proxy at least one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any
holder of Shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a
poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.3| The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any
class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise
expressly provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class, be
deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari
passu therewith. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10| Commission on Sale of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company may, in so far as the Statute permits, pay a commission to any
person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe whether
absolutely or conditionally for any Shares of the Company. Such commissions
may be satisfied by the payment of cash and/or the issue of fully or partly
paid-up Shares. The Company may also on any issue of Shares pay such brokerage
as may be lawful.

  



   | 11| Non Recognition of Trusts 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way (even
when notified) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any
Share, or (except only as is otherwise provided by these Articles or the
Statute) any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute
right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.

  



   | 12| Lien on Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.1| The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on all Shares
(whether fully paid-up or not) registered in the name of a Member (whether
solely or jointly with others) for all debts, liabilities or engagements to
or with the Company (whether presently payable or not) by such Member or his
estate, either alone or jointly with any other person, whether a Member or
not, but the Directors may at any time declare any Share to be wholly or in
part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The registration of a
transfer of any such Share shall operate as a waiver of the Company's
lien thereon. The Company's lien on a Share shall also extend to any amount
payable in respect of that Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.2| The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think
fit, any Shares on which the Company has a lien, if a sum in respect of which
the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen clear
days after notice has been given to the holder of the Shares, or to the person
entitled to it in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder,
demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the
Shares may be sold. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.3| To give effect to any such sale the Directors may authorise any
person to execute an instrument of transfer of the Shares sold to, or in
accordance with the directions of, the purchaser. The purchaser or his
nominee shall be registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any such
transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase
money, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or
invalidity in the sale or the exercise of the Company's power of sale under
these Articles. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-7

 



    



   | 12.4| The net proceeds of such sale after payment of costs, shall be
applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien
exists as is presently payable and any residue shall (subject to a like lien
for sums not presently payable as existed upon the Shares before the sale) be
paid to the person entitled to the Shares at the date of the sale. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13| Call on Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.1| Subject to the terms of the allotment the Directors may from
time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid on
their Shares (whether in respect of par value or premium), and each Member
shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen days notice specifying the time
or times of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times so specified the
amount called on the Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the
Directors may determine. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A
person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon
him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the Shares in respect of which
the call was made. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.2| A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the
resolution of the Directors authorising such call was passed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.3| The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.4| If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable,
the person from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from
the day it became due and payable until it is paid at such rate as the
Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of the interest
wholly or in part. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.5| An amount payable in respect of a Share on allotment or at any
fixed date, whether on account of the par value of the Share or premium or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the
provisions of these Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and
payable by virtue of a call. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.6| The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the
amount and times of payment of calls, or the interest to be paid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.7| The Directors may, if they think fit, receive an amount from
any Member willing to advance all or any part of the monies uncalled and
unpaid upon any Shares held by him, and may (until the amount would otherwise
become payable) pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the
Directors and the Member paying such amount in advance. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.8| No such amount paid in advance of calls shall entitle the
Member paying such amount to any portion of a Dividend declared in respect of
any period prior to the date upon which such amount would, but for such
payment, become payable. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-8

 



    



   | 14| Forfeiture of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.1| If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable
the Directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less than
fourteen clear days notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together
with any interest, which may have accrued. The notice shall specify where
payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with
the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be
forfeited. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.2| If the notice is not complied with any Share in respect of
which it was given may, before the payment required by the notice has been
made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall
include all Dividends or other monies declared payable in respect of the
forfeited Share and not paid before the forfeiture. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.3| A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise
disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and
at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be
cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of
its disposal a forfeited Share is to be transferred to any person the
Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of
the Share in favour of that person. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.4| A person any of whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to
be a Member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for
cancellation the certificate for the Shares forfeited and shall remain liable
to pay to the Company all monies which at the date of forfeiture were payable
by him to the Company in respect of those Shares together with interest, but
his liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received payment
in full of all monies due and payable by him in respect of those Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.5| A certificate in writing under the hand of one Director or
officer of the Company that a Share has been forfeited on a specified date
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact as against all persons claiming to
be entitled to the Share. The certificate shall (subject to the execution of
an instrument of transfer) constitute a good title to the Share and the
person to whom the Share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the Share
be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference
to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.6| The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply
in the case of non payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a
Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value
of the Share or by way of premium as if it had been payable by virtue of a
call duly made and notified. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15| Transmission of Shares 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.1| If a Member dies the survivor or survivors where he was a joint
holder or his legal personal representatives where he was a sole holder,
shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to
his interest. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any
liability in respect of any Share, which had been jointly held by him. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-9

 



    



   | 15.2| Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the
death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any
other way than by transfer) may, upon such evidence being produced as may
from time to time be required by the Directors, elect, by a notice in writing
sent by him, either to become the holder of such Share or to have some person
nominated by him become the holder of such Share but the Directors shall, in
either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they
would have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member
before his death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution, as the case may
be. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.3| A person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other case
than by transfer) shall be entitled to the same Dividends and
other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered
holder of such Share. However, he shall not, before becoming a Member in
respect of a Share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right
conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company and the
Directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect
either to be registered himself or to have some person nominated by him
become the holder of the Share (but the Directors shall, in either case, have
the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in
the case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member before his death
or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution or any other case than by
transfer, as the case may be). If the notice is not complied with within
ninety days the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all Dividends,
bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Share until the
requirements of the notice have been complied with. 
---|---|---

place, the day and the hour of the meeting and the general nature of the
business and shall be given in the manner hereinafter mentioned or in such
other manner if any as may be prescribed by the Company, provided that a
general meeting of the Company shall, whether or not the notice specified in
this regulation has been given and whether or not the provisions of the
Articles regarding general meetings have been complied with, be deemed to
have been duly convened if it is so agreed: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| in the case of an annual general meeting, by all the Members
(or their proxies) entitled to attend and vote thereat; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, by a majority
in number of the Members (or their proxies) having a right to attend and vote

---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.2| The accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to,
or the non receipt of notice of a meeting by, any person entitled to receive
notice shall not invalidate the proceedings of that meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20| Proceedings at General Meetings 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.1| No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a
quorum is present. Two Members being individuals present in person or by
proxy or if a corporation or other non-natural person by its duly authorised
representative or proxy shall be a quorum unless the Company has only one

shall be that one Member present in person or by proxy or (in the case of a
corporation or other non-natural person) by a duly authorised representative
or proxy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.2| A person may participate at a general meeting by conference
telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all the persons
participating in the meeting can communicate with each other. Participation
by a person in a general meeting in this manner is treated as presence in
person at that meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.3| A resolution (including a Special Resolution) in writing (in
one or more counterparts) signed by all Members for the time being entitled
to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings (or, being

of the Company duly convened and held. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.4| If a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time
appointed for the meeting or if during such a meeting a quorum ceases to be
present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be
dissolved and in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in
the next week at the same time and place or to such other day, time or such
other place as the Directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting a
quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the
meeting the Members present shall be a quorum. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.5| The chairman, if any, of the board of Directors shall preside
as chairman at every general meeting of the Company, or if there is no such
chairman, or if he shall not be present within fifteen minutes after the time
appointed for the holding of the meeting, or is unwilling to act, the
Directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman of the
meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-12

 



    



   | 20.6| If no Director is willing to act as chairman or if no Director
is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the

of the meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.7| The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a
quorum is present, (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the
meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be
transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at
the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a general meeting is
adjourned for thirty days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given as in the case of an original meeting. Otherwise it shall not be
necessary to give any such notice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.8| A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on
a show of hands unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, the
show of hands, the chairman demands a poll, or any other Member or Members
collectively present in person or by proxy and holding at least ten per cent.
in par value of the Shares giving a right to attend and vote at the meeting
demand a poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.9| Unless a poll is duly demanded a declaration by the chairman
that a resolution has been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular
majority, or lost or not carried by a particular majority, an entry to that
effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting shall be conclusive
evidence of that fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes
recorded in favour of or against such resolution. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.10| The demand for a poll may be withdrawn. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.11| Except on a poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a
question of adjournment, a poll shall be taken as the chairman directs, and
the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general
meeting at which the poll was demanded. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.12| A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question
of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other
question shall be taken at such time as the chairman of the general meeting
directs, and any business other than that upon which a poll has been demanded
or is contingent thereon may proceed pending the taking of the poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.13| In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands
or on a poll, the chairman shall be entitled to a second or casting vote. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21| Votes of Members 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.1| Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any Shares,
on a show of hands every Member who (being an individual) is present in
person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person is
present by its duly authorised representative or proxy, shall have one vote
and on a poll every Member shall have one vote for every Share of which he is
the holder.

C-13

 



    



   | 21.2| In the case of joint holders of record the vote of the senior
holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and seniority shall
be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the
Register of Members. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.3| A Member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has
been made by any court, having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a
show of hands or on a poll, by his committee, receiver, curator bonis, or
other person on such Member's behalf appointed by that court, and any such
committee, receiver, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.4| No person shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or
at any separate meeting of the holders of a class of Shares unless he is
registered as a Member on the record date for such meeting nor unless all
calls or other monies then payable by him in respect of Shares have been paid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.5| No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter
except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote
objected to is given or tendered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting
shall be valid. Any objection made in due time shall be referred to the
chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.6| On a poll or on a show of hands votes may be cast either
personally or by proxy. A Member may appoint more than one proxy or the same
proxy under one or more instruments to attend and vote at a meeting. Where a
Member appoints more than one proxy the instrument of proxy shall state which
proxy is entitled to vote on a show of hands. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.7| A Member holding more than one Share need not cast the votes in
respect of his Shares in the same way on any resolution and therefore may
vote a Share or some or all such Shares either for or against a resolution
and/or abstain from voting a Share or some or all of the Shares and, subject
to the terms of the instrument appointing him, a proxy appointed under one or
more instruments may vote a Share or some or all of the Shares in respect of
which he is appointed either for or against a resolution and/or abstain from
voting. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22| Proxies 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.1| The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing, be
executed under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised
in writing, or, if the appointor is a corporation under the hand of an
officer or attorney duly authorised for that purpose. A proxy need not be a
Member of the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.2| The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited at the
Registered Office or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in
the notice convening the meeting, or in any instrument of proxy sent out by
the Company:

   | (b)| in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is

instrument of proxy sent out by the Company, direct that the instrument
appointing a proxy may be deposited (no later than the time for holding the
meeting or adjourned meeting) at the Registered Office or at such other place
as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting, or in
any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company. The chairman may in any
event at his discretion direct that an instrument of proxy shall be deemed to
have been duly deposited. An instrument of proxy that is not deposited in the
manner permitted shall be invalid.

  



   | 22.3| The instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common
form and may be expressed to be for a particular meeting or any adjournment
thereof or generally until revoked. An instrument appointing a proxy shall be
deemed to include the power to demand or join or concur in demanding a poll. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.4| Votes given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of
proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the
principal or revocation of the proxy or of the authority under which the
proxy was executed, or the transfer of the Share in respect of which the proxy
is given unless notice in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or
transfer was received by the Company at the Registered Office before the
commencement of the general meeting, or adjourned meeting at which it is
sought to use the proxy.

   | 23| Corporate Members 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any corporation or other non-natural person which is a Member may in
accordance with its constitutional documents, or in the absence of such
provision by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise
such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting
of the Company or of any class of Members, and the person so authorised shall
be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he
represents as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member.

  



   | 24| Shares that May Not be Voted 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Shares in the Company that are beneficially owned by the Company shall not be
voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in

the Articles and to any directions given by Special Resolution, the business
of the Company shall be managed by the Directors who may exercise all the
powers of the Company. No alteration of the Memorandum or Articles and no such

   | 29.1| The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors
may be fixed by the Directors, and unless so fixed shall be two if there are
two or more Directors, and shall be one if there is only one Director. A

not present, be counted in the quorum. A Director who also acts as an
alternate Director shall, if his appointor is not present, count twice towards
the quorum. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.2| Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the Directors may
regulate their proceedings as they think fit. Questions arising at any

all the Directors or all the members of a committee of Directors (an
alternate Director being entitled to sign such a resolution on behalf of his
appointor) shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a
meeting of the Directors, or committee of Directors as the case may be, duly
convened and held.

Directors (or their alternates) either at, before or after the meeting is
held. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.6| The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in
their body, but if and so long as their number is reduced below the number
fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors
the continuing Directors or Director may act for the purpose of increasing the
number of Directors to that number, or of summoning a general meeting of the
Company, but for no other purpose. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.7| The Directors may elect a chairman of their board and determine
the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is
elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes
after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may

C-17

 



    



   | 29.8| All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee
of Directors (including any person acting as an alternate Director) shall,
notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect
in the appointment of any Director or alternate Director, or that they or any
of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly
appointed and qualified to be a Director or alternate Director as the case may
be. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 29.9| A Director but not an alternate Director may be represented at
any meetings of the board of Directors by a proxy appointed in writing by
him. The proxy shall count towards the quorum and the vote of the proxy shall
for all purposes be deemed to be that of the appointing Director.

---|---|--- 
  



  

A Director of the Company who is present at a meeting of the board of
Directors at which action on any Company matter is taken shall be presumed to
have assented to the action taken unless his dissent shall be entered in the
minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent from such
action with the person acting as the chairman or secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered
post to such person immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such
right to dissent shall not apply to a Director who voted in favour of such
action.

  



   | 31| Directors' Interests 
---|---|---

contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the
Company in which any Director or alternate Director shall be in any way
interested be or be liable to be avoided, nor shall any Director or alternate
Director so contracting or being so interested be liable to account to the
Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason
of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby
established. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be
at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is

Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the Directors may

which the Seal has been affixed shall be signed by at least one person who
shall be either a Director or some officer or other person appointed by the
Directors for the purpose. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 37.2| The Company may have for use in any place or places outside the
Cayman Islands a duplicate Seal or Seals each of which shall be a facsimile

   | 38| Dividends, Distributions and Reserve 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.1| Subject to the Statute and this Article, the Directors may
declare Dividends and distributions on Shares in issue and authorise payment
of the Dividends or distributions out of the funds of the Company lawfully
available therefor. No Dividend or distribution shall be paid except out of
the realised or unrealised profits of the Company or out of the share premium
account or as otherwise permitted by the Statute. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.2| Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to Shares,
all Dividends shall be declared and paid according to the par value of the
Shares that a Member holds. If any Share is issued on terms providing that it
shall rank for Dividend as from a particular date, that Share shall rank for
Dividend accordingly. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.3| The Directors may deduct from any Dividend or distribution
payable to any Member all sums of money (if any) then payable by him to the
Company on account of calls or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.4| The Directors may declare that any Dividend or distribution be
paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in
particular of shares, debentures, or securities of any other company or in
any one or more of such ways and where any difficulty arises in regard to such
distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and
in particular may issue fractional Shares and fix the value for distribution
of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash
payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in
order to adjust the rights of all Members and may vest any such specific
assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.5| Any Dividend, distribution, interest or other monies payable in
cash in respect of Shares may be paid by wire transfer to the holder or by
cheque or warrant sent through the post directed to the registered address of
the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of the
holder who is first named on the Register of Members or to such person and to
such address as such holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such
cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it
is sent. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for
any Dividends, bonuses, or other monies payable in respect of the Share held
by them as joint holders. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-21

 



    



   | 38.6| No Dividend or distribution shall bear interest against the
Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 38.7| Any Dividend which cannot be paid to a Member and/or which
remains unclaimed after six months from the date of the declaration of such
Dividend may, in the discretion of the Directors, be paid into a separate
account in the Company's name, provided that the Company shall not be
constituted as a trustee in respect of that account and the Dividend shall
remain as a debt due to the Member. Any Dividend which remains unclaimed after
a period of six years from the date of the declaration of such dividend shall
be forfeited and shall revert to the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 39| Capitalisation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the
Company's reserve accounts (including share premium account and capital
redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to the credit of profit and loss
account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sum
to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible
amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of Dividend
and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for
allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in
the proportion aforesaid. In such event the Directors shall do all acts and
things required to give effect to such capitalisation, with full power to the
Directors to make such provisions as they think fit for the case of Shares
becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby the benefit
of fractional entitlements accrue to the Company rather than to the Members
concerned). The Directors may authorise any person to enter on behalf of all
of the Members interested into an agreement with the Company providing for
such capitalisation and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made
under such authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned.

---|---|--- 
  



   | 40.1| The Directors shall cause proper books of account to be kept
with respect to all sums of money received and expended by the Company and
the matters in respect of which the receipt or expenditure takes place, all
sales and purchases of goods by the Company and the assets and liabilities of
the Company. Proper books shall not be deemed to be kept if there are not
kept such books of account as are necessary to give a true and fair view of
the state of the Company's affairs and to explain its transactions. The
Company shall cause all books of account to be maintained for a minimum
period of five years from the date on which they were prepared. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 40.2| The Directors shall from time to time determine whether and to
what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or
regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be
open to the inspection of Members not being Directors and no Member (not being
a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or
document of the Company except as conferred by Statute or authorised by the
Directors or by the Company in general meeting. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-22

 



    



   | 40.3| The Directors may from time to time cause to be prepared and to

all times to the books and accounts and vouchers of the Company and shall be

duties of the Auditor. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 41.3| Auditors shall, if so required by the Directors, make a report
on the accounts of the Company during their tenure of office at the next
annual general meeting following their appointment in the case of a company
which is registered with the Registrar of Companies as an ordinary company,
and at the next extraordinary general meeting following their appointment in
the case of a company which is registered with the Registrar of Companies as
an exempted company, and at any other time during their term of office, upon

   | 42| Notices 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 42.1| Notices shall be in writing and may be given by the Company to
any Member either personally or by sending it by courier, post, cable, telex,
fax or e-mail to him or to his address as shown in the Register of Members
(or where the notice is given by e-mail by sending it to the e-mail address
provided by such Member). Any notice, if posted from one country to another,
is to be sent airmail. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 42.2| Where a notice is sent by courier, service of the notice shall
be deemed to be effected by delivery of the notice to a courier company, and
shall be deemed to have been received on the third day (not including
Saturdays or Sundays or public holidays) following the day on which the notice
was delivered to the courier. Where a notice is sent by post, service of the
notice shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre paying and
posting a letter containing the notice, and shall be deemed to have been
received on the fifth day (not including Saturdays or Sundays or public
holidays) following the day on which the notice was posted. Where a notice is
sent by cable, telex or fax, service of the notice shall be deemed to be
effected by properly addressing and sending such notice and shall be deemed to
have been received on the same day that it was transmitted. Where a notice is
given by e-mail service shall be deemed to be effected by transmitting the
e-mail to the e-mail address provided by the intended recipient and shall be
deemed to have been received on the same day that it was sent, and it shall
not be necessary for the receipt of the e-mail to be acknowledged by the
recipient. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 42.3| A notice may be given by the Company to the person or persons
which the Company has been advised are entitled to a Share or Shares in
consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member in the same manner as
other notices which are required to be given under these Articles and shall be
addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the
deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description at the
address supplied for that purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled,
or at the option of the Company by giving the notice in any manner in which
the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

C-23

 



    



   | 42.4| Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner
hereinbefore authorised to every person shown as a Member in the Register of
Members on the record date for such meeting except that in the case of joint
holders the notice shall be sufficient if given to the joint holder first
named in the Register of Members and every person upon whom the ownership of
a Share devolves by reason of his being a legal personal representative or a
trustee in bankruptcy of a Member of record where the Member of record but
for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the
meeting, and no other person shall be entitled to receive notices of general
meetings. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 43| Winding Up 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 43.1| If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for
distribution amongst the Members shall be insufficient to pay the whole of
the share capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may
be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the par value of
the Shares held by them. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 43.2| If in a winding up the assets available for distribution
amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the
share capital at the commencement of the winding up, the surplus shall be
distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares
held by them at the commencements of the winding up subject to a deduction
from those Shares in respect of which there are monies due, of all monies
payable to the Company for unpaid calls or otherwise. This Article is without
prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special
terms and conditions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 43.3| If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator may, with the
sanction of a Special Resolution of the Company and any other sanction
required by the Statute, divide in kind amongst the Members the whole or any
part of the assets of the Company (whether such assets shall consist of
property of the same kind or not) and may for that purpose value any assets
and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the Members or
different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction,
vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the
benefit of the Members as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think
fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which
there is a liability. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 44| Indemnity 
---|---|--- 
  



  

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized
to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which
applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through
agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is
amended after approval by the shareholders of this Article 44 to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so
amended.

incorporation, shall begin on 1st January in each year.

  



   | 46| Transfer by way of Continuation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Company is exempted as defined in the Statute, it shall, subject to
the provisions of the Statute and with the approval of a Special Resolution,
have the power to register by way of continuation as a body corporate under
the laws of any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands and to be

EXHIBIT D

  



  

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 
 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
 OF 
 HENNESSY CAPITAL ACQUISITION CORP. IV

  



  

Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies that:

  



  

ONE: The name of this company is Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV and
the date of filing the original Certificate of Incorporation of this
corporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware was August 6, 2018.

  



  

TWO: Ulrich Kranz is the duly elected and acting Chief Executive Officer of
Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, a Delaware corporation.

  



  

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this
corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

  



  

I.

  



  

The name of this corporation is Canoo Inc. (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

II.

  



  

The address of the Company's registered office in the State of Delaware is
Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

  



  

III.

  



  

The purpose of the Company is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law (" _DGCL_ ").

  



  

IV.

  



  

A. The Company is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated,
respectively, " _Common Stock_ " and " _Preferred Stock_." The total number
of shares which the Company is authorized to issue is 510,000,000 shares.
500,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one-
hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock,
each having a par value of one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001).

  



  

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ "), each
one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Class A Common Stock_ "), that was issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated
and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_
"), without any further action by the Company or any stockholder thereof.
Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Prior Certificate_ ") shall, until
surrendered to the Company in exchange for a certificate representing the
same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of
shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock
represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and
redesignated.

  



  

   

D-1

 



    



  

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") is hereby
expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the
shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of
shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers,
full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and
relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications,
limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the
issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of
Directors is also expressly authorized to increase (but not above the total
number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the
number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any
series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number
of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that
they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number
of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a
separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof,
unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any
certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock.

  



  

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company
for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law,
holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of
Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either
separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such
series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

  



  

V.

  



  

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Company, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of
the Company, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof,
as the case may be, it is further provided that:

  



  

A.

  



  

1\. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Company shall be vested in the Board of Directors. The number of directors
which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by
resolutions adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors.

  



  

2\. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall
be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III,
respectively. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the
Board of Directors already in office to such classes at the time the
classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of
stockholders after the date hereof, the term of office of the Class I
directors shall expire and Class I directors shall be elected for a full term
of three years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders after the date
hereof, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class
II directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third
annual meeting of stockholders after the date hereof, the term of office of
the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors shall be elected
for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to
succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

  



  

No stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate
votes to which such stockholder is entitled unless required by applicable law
at the time of such election. During such time or times that applicable law
requires cumulative voting, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election
for directors may cumulate such stockholder's votes and give one candidate a
number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by
the number of votes to which such stockholder's shares are otherwise entitled,
or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same principle among as many
candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. No stockholder, however, shall be
entitled to so cumulate such stockholder's votes unless (i) the names of such
candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the voting
and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting,
of such stockholder's intention to cumulate such stockholder's votes. If any
stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders may
cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in
nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest
number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

  



  

   

D-2

 



    



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each director shall
serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or
her earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
incumbent director.

  



  

3\. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable
law, any individual director or directors may be removed with cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
generally at an election of directors.

  



  

4\. VACANCIES. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law and
subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any
vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the
Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly
created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders and except as
otherwise provided by applicable law, be filled only by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum of
the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of
the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred
and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.

  



  

B.

  



  

1\. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal
of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the
approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders
shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company;
_provided, however,_ that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by
stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class.

  



  

2\. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless
the Bylaws so provide.

  



  

3\. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
permitting the holders of such series of Preferred Stock to act by written
consent, no action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Company except
at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders called in
accordance with the Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders
by written consent or electronic transmission.

  



  

4\. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors
and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company shall be given in the manner provided in the
Bylaws of the Company.

  



  

5\. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
permitting the holders of such series of Preferred Stock to call a special
meeting of the holders of such series, special meetings of the stockholders
of the Company may be called only by the chairperson of the Board of
Directors, the chief executive officer of the Company or the Board of
Directors, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting of
the stockholders is hereby specifically denied.

  



  

VI.

  



  

A. The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  



  

   

D-3

 



    



  

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall
provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors,
officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable
law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions,
agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is
amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so
amended.

  



  

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective
and shall not affect the rights or protections or increase the liability of
any director under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged
occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or
indemnification.

  



  

VII.

  



  

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and
only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of
actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any
action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other
employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any
action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against
the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of
the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the
Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or
proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation
or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL
confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or
(F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer
or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the
court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a
duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

  



  

B. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of Section
VII.A is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of
Delaware (a " _Foreign Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such
stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of
Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce
Section VII.A (an " _Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of process
made upon such stockholder in any such Enforcement Action by service upon
such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such
stockholder.

  



  

C. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be
the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

D. Any person or entity purchasing, holding, owning or otherwise acquiring
any interest in any security of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of
and to have consented to the provisions of this Article VII.

  



  

VIII.

  



  

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except

the Company will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may
become aware to the Company, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity
shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Company
with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely
in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and (i) such
opportunity is one the Company is legally and contractually permitted to
undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Company to pursue and (ii)
the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Company
without violating any legal obligation.
