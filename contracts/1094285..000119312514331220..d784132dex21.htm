-iii- _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 3, 2014, is by and among TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), LIGHTNING MERGER SUB, INC., a Connecticut
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
BOLT TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Connecticut corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub, and the Board of Directors of the Company have each adopted this
Agreement and have approved and determined that it is advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and shareholders to consummate
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with
the Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger, upon and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which the
shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Shares_ " or the
" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_), other than shares described in
_Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section
2.3(b)_), will be converted into the right to receive $22.00 per Share in cash
(the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, and covenants, and to enter into certain
agreements, in connection with the Merger; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into a Shareholders Agreement,
dated the date hereof, with certain officers of the Company named
therein (the " _Officers_ "), the form of which is attached as _Exhibit A-1_
hereto, and with certain directors of the Company named therein (the "
_Directors_ ", and together with the Officers, the " _Shareholders_ "), the
form of which is attached as _Exhibit A-2_ hereto (collectively, the "
_Shareholders  Agreement_"), pursuant to which each Shareholder has, among
other things, agreed to vote all Shares beneficially owned by such
Shareholder in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and against any Takeover
Proposal (as defined in _Section 5.2(f)_), in each case subject to and on the
conditions set forth therein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the Connecticut Business Corporations Act, as
amended (the " _CBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub
shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which:

 

(a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease;

 



1 (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the name "Teledyne Bolt, Inc."
and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut; and

 

(c) the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger.

The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated
at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_
hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law. The by-laws
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by law, by the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and
by the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 33-820 of the CBCA.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Connecticut local time, on a date to be
specified by the parties hereto, which shall be as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than the fourth Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ hereof (the " _Closing Date_
"), at or directed from the offices of McGuireWoods LLP, 1345 Avenue of the
Americas, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10105-0106, unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ that, the
parties may participate in the Closing remotely by electronic delivery of
documents and/or funds. " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or day on which banking institutions are required or
authorized by law to be closed in the State of California or the State of
Connecticut.

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall
cause an appropriate certificate of merger meeting the requirements of
Section 33-819 of the CBCA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed
and filed on the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 1.3_) (or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Connecticut Secretary of
State (the " _Secretary of State_ ") as provided in the CBCA. The Merger shall
become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 33-819 of the CBCA or
such later time as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto and set forth in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the CBCA (such time of
effectiveness, the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
parties hereto shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary so that
the directors of Merger Sub and those individuals designated by Parent on or
prior to the Closing Date shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation, or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and
by-laws.

 



2 Section 1.5 _Shareholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

(a) Subject to the Companys rights under  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, the
Company, acting through its Board of Directors (the " _Board_ "), shall, in
accordance with applicable law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the
Company By-laws and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ:

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold a special meeting of
its shareholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the
date hereof with the record date and the meeting date of the Special Meeting
to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting (A)
after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter
defined) is provided to the Companys shareholders within a reasonable amount
of time in advance of the Special Meeting, (B) as otherwise required by
applicable law, or (C) if as of the time for which the Special Meeting is
scheduled as set forth in the Proxy Statement, there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting;

(ii) (A) obtain and furnish the information required to be included by
the federal securities laws (and the rules and regulations thereunder) in a
proxy statement in preliminary and definitive form relating to the Special
Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and prepare and file with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), as soon as
reasonably practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy Statement relating to the Merger
and this Agreement, (B) respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to such preliminary Proxy Statement and, as soon as practicable
thereafter, cause a definitive Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its
shareholders, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws;

 

(iii) include in the Proxy Statement (A) the unanimous recommendation
of the Board that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
of the Merger and the approval of this Agreement, unless such recommendation
has been withdrawn, or unless such recommendation has been modified or
amended, in each case in accordance with _Section 5.2_, and (B) the opinion
of Johnson Rice and Company L.L.C. (the " _Financial Advisor_ ") described in
_Section 3.23_ (if the Financial Advisor authorizes such inclusion,
which authorization the Company will request); and

 



3 (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary
approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its shareholders as soon as
practicable (including by retaining an outside proxy solicitation firm at the
Companys own cost and expense);

 

(b) Parent shall provide the Company with the information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub reasonably required to be included in the Proxy
Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement (or
any amendments or supplements thereto) prior to the filing of any such
document with the SEC. The Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any and all comments made by Parent and its counsel and will
incorporate reasonable comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to filing.
In addition, the Company will provide Parent and its counsel, in writing, any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments or
other communications, and the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such comments. The Company will respond promptly to any such comments from the
SEC or its staff, will give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
and all comments made by Parent and will incorporate reasonable comments of
Parent and/or its counsel prior to any such response. Parent shall vote, or
cause to be voted, all of the Shares (if any) then owned by it, Merger Sub,
or any of its other Subsidiaries (as defined in _Section 3.1(c)_) or
Affiliates (as defined in _Section 8.10_) in favor of the approval of the
Merger and the approval of this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i)
correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the
Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so
corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to its shareholders (and will use its reasonable efforts to
incorporate any reasonable comments of Parent and/or its counsel prior to
such filing and dissemination), in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
shares of the Company Common Stock or of the shares of common stock, no par
value, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, no par value,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



4 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock, all shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock, other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (if any), shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, payable
to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing
such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_.
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change, such
that the holders of Company Common Stock and other Company securities are
provided the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; _provided_ that nothing in this  _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to make the payments of the Merger Consideration to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant
to  _Section 2.1(c)_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
the aggregate amount of such Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent in
trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with _Section 2.1_ for timely payment hereunder (the
" _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in
(i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for payment of all principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing,
or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of Parent; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable hereunder. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee, as
Parent directs. Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Paying
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

 



5 (b) _Share Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration:

 

(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify); and

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed by the
holder of such Certificate in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration (subject to _Section 2.2(e)_ and _Section 2.2(f)_)
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to an
individual, corporation, limited liability company, or other entity (a "
_Person_ ") other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate
held by a holder whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c))_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. If any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity
against any action that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this _ARTICLE
II_.

 

(c) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_.

 



6 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for Merger Consideration in the proper
amount of cash as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

(e) _Return of Funds; No Liability_. At any time following 270
calendar days after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been
deposited with the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates, and thereafter such holders of Certificates shall be entitled
to look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates such holder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a Certificate for the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar
law.

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger, or to a holder
of a Company Stock Right or Company Restricted Shares pursuant to  _Section
2.4_, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined in _Section 3.16_) or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares or the Company Stock Rights or the Company Restricted Shares,
as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) In accordance with Sections 33-856 to 33-872 of the CBCA (the "
_CBCA Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), appraisal rights may be available to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any shares of
Company Common Stock held of record by Persons who, prior to the Special
Meeting, have objected to the Merger and complied with all applicable
provisions of the CBCA Appraisal

 



7  Rights Provisions necessary to perfect and maintain their appraisal rights
thereunder (any such shares of Company Common Stock, " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but instead shall entitle the holder of such Dissenting
Shares to such rights as may be available under the CBCA Appraisal Rights
Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if after the Effective Time (i)
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
rights under the CBCA Appraisal Rights Provisions or (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by the CBCA, the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Parent prompt
written notice of its receipt of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock if the Merger is effectuated, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, offer to
settle or settle, any such demands. After the Effective Time, Parent shall
pay, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, any amounts that may
become payable in respect of Dissenting Shares under the CBCA Appraisal Rights
Provisions.

 

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Vesting, Cash-Out and Cancellation of Company Stock Rights_. As
of the Effective Time, each unexercised and unexpired option or other similar
equity award with option-like features that is settled in, or relates to
Company Common Stock (other than Company Restricted Shares as defined in
_Section 2.4(b)_) held under any stock or stock-based plan of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including without limitation the Companys
2012 Stock Incentive Plan and the Companys Amended and Restated 2006 Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Plan, each as amended, and the award agreements
thereunder (collectively, the " _Company Stock-Based Plans_ "), or under any
separate agreement (each, a " _Company Stock Right_ "), shall fully and
immediately vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock-Based Plan, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any action
on the part of any holder thereof. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Right, whether or not vested, shall be canceled and automatically
converted into and shall entitle the holder thereof to a right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) excess, if any, of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price or strike price, as the case may
be, of the Company Stock Right, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Right, subject to _Section
2.2(e)_ and _Section 2.2(f)_ hereof (the " _Stock Right Termination
Consideration_ "). In the event the per share exercise price or the strike
price or base price of a Company Stock Right, as adjusted, is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Right shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time without the payment of any consideration
therefor and shall have no further force or effect. Payment of the Stock Right
Termination Consideration shall be made following the Effective Time in
accordance with the Companys payroll practices and, to the extent
practicable, as part of the payment made in respect of the first full payroll
period ending after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after such date. The Company

 



8  Stock-Based Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time the holders of Company Stock Rights shall have no further
rights with respect thereto other than to receive the Stock Right Termination
Consideration, if any, as provided herein.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each outstanding share of restricted
stock awarded under the Company Stock-Based Plans or under any separate
agreement (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of
restrictions as of the Effective Time and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, subject to the
applicable provisions of _Section 2.2_. All payments with respect to such
Company Restricted Shares shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to
the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
adopt such resolutions as shall be necessary, and will take all such other
actions as may be required, to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_, including without limitation to effectuate the vesting of the
Company Stock Rights and Company Restricted Shares and the termination of the
Company Stock-Based Plans, in each case as of the Effective Time, without
paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

ERISA Affiliates or to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is

has occurred or exists after the date of such determination that has or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such determination.

 



20 (d) No condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any direct or indirect liability under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 4976 of the Code or that is reasonably likely to
result in any loss of a federal tax deduction under Section 280G or Section
162(m) of the Code.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
bound by, any collective bargaining agreement (other than as set forth in

of the Companys Subsidiaries is not an employee of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries under applicable law or for any purpose including for

compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including

liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary for any current or former
Company Benefit Plan has been

effected in all material respects and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability with respect to such termination or
transfer.

(i) Except as set forth in  _Section 3.11(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, neither the requisite corporate or shareholder approval
of, nor the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will (either alone or together with any other event, including any
termination of employment) entitle any current or former officer, employee,
director or other independent contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary to any
change in control payment or benefit, transaction bonus or similar benefit
or severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan. _Section 3.11(i) of the

benefit or severance pay due and owing to each director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary.

Schedule_, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any material liability
in respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
any current or former officer, employee, director, or independent contractor
except as required to avoid excise Tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

(k) All contributions and other payment due from the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been made or paid in
full, and all of the assets which have been set aside in a trust, escrow
account or insurance company separate account to satisfy any
obligations under any Company Benefit Plan are shown on the books and records
of each such trust or account at their current fair market value as of the
most recent valuation date for such trust or account, and the fair market
value of all such assets as of each such valuation date equals or exceeds the
present value of any obligation under any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(l) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims with respect to a Company Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits made in the ordinary course of the plans operations) or

employment of any current or former officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary, which claims could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to the Company or a Subsidiary,
and no audit or investigation by any domestic or foreign governmental
or other law enforcement agency is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or a Subsidiary, has been proposed with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan.

contributes to (or is obligated to contribute to) any Company Benefit Plan
that is primarily subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States.

compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), including
each award thereunder, has been operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and other official guidance issued thereunder
(collectively, " _Section 409A_ ") and has been since January 1, 2009, in
documentary compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A; (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (1) have been required to
report to any government entity or authority any corrections made or Taxes due
as a result of a failure to comply with Section 409A and (2) have any
indemnity or gross-up obligation for any Taxes or interest imposed or
accelerated under Section 409A; (iii) nothing has occurred, whether by action
or failure to act, or is reasonably expected or intended to occur, that would
subject an individual having rights under any such Company Benefit Plan to
accelerated Tax as a result of Section 409A or a Tax imposed under Section
409A; and (iv) for any Company Benefit Plan that is not intended to be
subject to Section 409A because it is not a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(a)(2) through 1.409A-1(a)(5), or due
to the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b), all the
conditions required to retain such treatment remain in effect and are not
reasonably expected to change so as to subject such Company Benefit Plan to

ERISA Affiliates, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer or employee
thereof, has made any written, or to the Knowledge of the Company, oral,
promises or commitments to any employee, director, officer or other service
provider, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional plan,
agreement or arrangement, or to modify or change in any material way any
existing Company Benefit Plan. No event, condition or circumstance exists that
would prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan other
than the satisfaction of any applicable legal requirements, including the
giving of notice, and any such termination would not result in any cost or
other liability, other than administrative or termination costs or fees that
are not material and liability for all contributions due from the Company
through the termination.

nonpublic information delivered to such Person concurrently with its delivery
to the requesting Person, and (C) participate in negotiations with such
Person regarding such Superior Proposal or such Takeover Proposal; _provided_
_further_ , that the actions described in clauses (B) and (C) of the
immediately preceding proviso may be taken only on or before the date the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained. It is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director,
investment banker, attorney, or other advisor or representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.2(a)_ by the Company.

 



47 (b) Except as expressly permitted in this  _Section 5.2(b)_, neither
the Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i)
withdraw, qualify, or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval, determination of
advisability, or recommendation by the Board or any such committee of this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal,
(iii) in the event of a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding
Company Common Stock, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Companys shareholders within ten (10)
Business Days of the commencement thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the
taking of no position or a neutral position by the Board in respect of the
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders as of
the end of the ten (10) day Business Day period shall constitute a failure to
recommend against any such offer); (iv) cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.2(a)_), or (v) recommend
that the Companys shareholders reject adoption of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby (any action described in clauses
(i)-(v) above being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, prior to the date of the
Special Meeting, and subject to compliance with all of the requirements of
this _Section 5.2(b)_ and _Sections 5.2(a)_ , _5.2(c)_ and _5.2(d)_ , (xx)
withdraw or modify its approval, determination of advisability, or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (yy) determine to be advisable or recommend a Superior
Proposal, if in either case the Board determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the Companys shareholders under applicable law, either (A) in response to
a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in
circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, after
considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with
outside counsel, or (B) based upon a material development or change that
impacts the Company that was neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by,
the Board or management of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of or
prior to the date hereof (such material development or change in
circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "); _provided that_ (a) in no event
shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal constitute an
Intervening Event and (b) any effect resulting from any of the Changes
specified in _Section 3.1(b)(ii)(1) through (11)_ shall not be considered
when determining whether an Intervening Effect shall have occurred.

 

(c) The Company may take the actions described in _Section 5.2(b)(xx)_
and  _(yy)_ only after (i) providing Parent prompt written notice (within 24
hours of receipt) advising Parent that the Board has received a Superior
Proposal or that an Intervening Event has occurred, such notice also
specifying, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal (unless identifying the Person would violate an obligation
of confidentiality), and in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event, and (ii) Parent does not
provide within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the written notice from
the Company 

 



48  of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event an offer that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor, in the case of a Superior Proposal, is at least as
favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys shareholders (taking
into account all the terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement
that the Board determines in good faith to be relevant), or in the case of an
Intervening Event, obviates the need for the Company to take the actions
described in _Section 5.2(b)(xx)_ and _(yy)_. In the event Parents offer (as
described in the preceding sentence) is determined by the Company, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, to be at least as favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys shareholders, or in the case of an Intervening
Event, to obviate the need for the Company to take the actions described in 
_Section 5.2(b)(xx)_ and _(yy)_ , then this Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended in accordance with the terms of that offer, Company shall terminate
such other discussions, and (subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) take any and all necessary actions to consummate the Merger.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt of any Takeover Proposal)
advise Parent in writing of (i) any inquiry or indication of interest that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (ii) any request
for confidential information in connection with a Takeover Proposal, (iii) any
Takeover Proposal, including a Superior Proposal, (iv) the Boards
determination that any Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, (v) the material terms and conditions of such inquiry,
indication of interest, request for confidential information or any Takeover
Proposal, (vi) the identity of the Person making such request or such Takeover
Proposal (unless identifying the Person would violate an obligation of
confidentiality), and (vii) any requests made by the Company for information
about the Takeover Proposal or the Person that made it. The Company shall keep
Parent fully informed with respect to the status of any such inquiry,
indication of interest, request for confidential information,
Takeover Proposal, or any significant developments in respect thereof.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Companys shareholders;  _provided_ , _however_ , neither
the Company nor the Board or any committee thereof shall, except as in
accordance with _Section 5.2(b)_, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, its approval, determination or recommendation or approve,
determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
determine to be advisable, or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and
representatives) to acquire or purchase, directly or indirectly, 20% or more
of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, 

 



49  or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
representatives) for the direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or
more of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, or 50% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 50% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, made on terms that the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel and
taking into account all relevant factors, including all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal (including, but not
limited to, any break-up fee, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions and
timing to consummation, form of consideration and any financing required and
whether or not such financing is subject to any contingency) and the Person
or group making such Takeover Proposal) to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys shareholders than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the financial terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Superior Proposal unless (A) there is no financing contingency and any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such proposal
is committed at least to the same extent as the financing arranged by Parent
and (B) there will not be a due diligence condition to the third partys
obligation to consummate the transactions that are the subject of such
proposal in the definitive agreement related thereto; (C) the transactions
contemplated by such Takeover Proposal are reasonably capable of being
completed in accordance with their terms without undue delay; and (D) the
Board has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside counsel) that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Any Superior Proposal is a Takeover Proposal.

 



50 (g) The Board shall not, in connection with any Change of
Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the Board for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.3 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to both Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation
of the other parties hereto, except any publication of any press release or
other announcement made in connection with any Superior Proposal or as may be
required by law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party hereto wanting
to make such release.

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company
and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the other if any of the
following occur after the date of this Agreement: (a) receipt of any notice or
other communication in writing from any Person, not a party hereto, alleging
that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) receipt
of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity or NASDAQ
(or any other securities market), as applicable, in connection with the

which would be reasonably likely to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or (ii) cause any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied at any time prior to the Outside
Date (as defined in _Section 7.1(b)(ii))_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any written notice pursuant to this  _Section 5.4 _shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies of the parties hereto available
hereunder.

 

Section 5.5 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, and subject to such requirements as the Company
reasonably may impose to minimize disruption of its business, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Parent, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time,
reasonable access to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, its facilities (including without limitation to
perform environmental assessments), and to its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it with or from the SEC during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
representatives to, hold in confidence all Evaluation Material (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries furnished to it in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, pursuant to this _Section 5.5(a)_ or otherwise, in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



51  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would (a) violate applicable law or a contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, (b) jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, (c) expose the Company to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information, or (d) except
as otherwise provided in _Section 5.5(b)_, require invasive environmental
sampling (it being understood, in case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), that the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such access or
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy,
violation or exposure).

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company
shall permit Parent to conduct such environmental inspections of the
Companys Leased Real Property located in Connecticut as Parent reasonably
deems necessary to assess the environmental remediation obligations that could
arise pursuant to the Connecticut Transfer Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. section
22a-134 et seq., including, without limitation, a Phase II environmental
investigation or similar invasive testing of ground soil, soil vapor or ground
water in connection therewith. The Company shall, and shall cause its
officers, employees, counsel and other representatives to, cooperate with
Parent in connection with such inspections, including, without limitation, (i)
making any appropriate filings and meeting with the Connecticut Department
of Energy and Environmental Protection and (ii) using its best efforts to
obtain any required landlord consent necessary to conduct such investigation
and testing.

 

Section 5.6 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may
be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Merger, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate
with the other parties hereto to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third

their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of any such consent, authorization, order, or approval; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties
or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Merger. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (x) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business
Days of the date hereof and to take any and all other reasonable actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as possible and (y) file any notifications
or filings required to be filed under similar applicable foreign laws and
regulations as promptly as reasonably practicable, in any event within fifteen
(15) days of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision in this Agreement to the

 



52  contrary, in connection with seeking any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in no event
will any party hereto be obligated to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold
separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to,
any assets or any portion of any business of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries,
the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, using all reasonable efforts to lift or rescind
any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and using all reasonable efforts to defend any litigation seeking to
enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or seeking material damages.

Section 5.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, advance expenses to, and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by law, in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred prior to or after the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions substantially similar
in terms to the rights granted in the provisions with respect to
indemnification and insurance set forth in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company By-laws in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Companys employees, agents,
directors or officers for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time, except if such amendment is required by applicable law.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or
directors conduct complies with the standards set forth in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-laws shall be made by
independent counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to such
officer or director. Parent shall pay such reasonable counsels fees and
expenses. With respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may, in its sole discretion, on or prior to the
Effective Time (after consultation with Parent) purchase (and if it does not,
at or after the Effective Time Parent shall purchase or cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase) a tail, run-off or similar directors and officers
liability insurance coverage policy for a period of six (6) years, with the
same or substantially similar coverages as are currently in effect for the
Company, at no cost to the beneficiaries thereof; _provided_ that the total
premiums to be paid for such policy shall not exceed $150,000 annually (and if
the total premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a tail policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount). If the
Company does purchase such a tail, run-off or similar directors and officers
liability insurance coverage policy prior to the Effective Time in compliance
with this _Section 5.7_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such policy as purchased by the Company in full force and effect and continue
to honor their respective obligations thereunder.

 



53 (b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For purposes of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section

Parent under which an employees benefits depends, in whole or in part, on
length of service, credit will be given to current employees of the Company ("
_Company Employees_ ") for service with the Company prior to the Effective
Time, _provided_ that except in the case of severance or vacation accrual,
such crediting of service shall be solely for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under such plans and not for purposes of benefit accrual, and
_provided_ _further_ that such crediting is permitted under the terms of such
plans (including, without limitation the Teledyne Technologies Incorporated
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Stock Advantage Plan), and applicable law
and does not result in duplication of benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all Company
Benefit Plans that are in effect as of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, or may cause the Surviving Corporation to, amend,
modify or terminate any individual Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its
terms and applicable law.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take the necessary action
to terminate its 401(k) plans effective as of the Closing Date. Upon request
of an employee of the Company and to the extent permitted by the Companys
401(k) plans and applicable law, Parent shall permit the direct rollover of
cash account balances and any notes evidencing an outstanding plan loan or
loans to Parents 401(k) plan. The Company further agrees, upon Parents
request (which request shall be made no less than ten (10) days prior the
Effective Time), to take any and all actions required (including the adoption
of resolutions by the Board) to amend, freeze and/or terminate any or all
Company Benefit Plans immediately before (but contingent upon) the Effective
Time, and, if requested by Parent, to implement any and all such actions.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.8_, (iii) limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any Company Employee at any time, (iv) require Parent or any

salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period
following the Effective Time or (v) obligate the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to (A) maintain
any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any
particular Company Employee.

 



54 Section 5.9 _Special Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 1.5_, the Company will take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable law and the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company By-laws to convene as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof the Special Meeting and shall submit this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby for
approval of the shareholders of the Company at such meeting or any adjournment
thereof.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 1.5_ and _Section 5.2_, the Company, through

to be considered at the Special Meeting, in each case to the extent that the
Company has such information readily available or can obtain it without undue
effort or expense.

 

Section 5.10 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole
expense of, Parent.

 

Section 5.11 _Confidentiality_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
7.1_, the non-disclosure obligations contained in that certain letter
agreement, dated June 16, 2014, between Parent and the Company shall remain in
full force and effect pursuant to the terms thereof.

Section 5.12 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that
any shareholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought against the Company,
its Subsidiaries and/or the members of the Board after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent of any
such Transaction Litigation, give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense of any such litigation and keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company agrees
that it shall not compromise, offer to settle, agree to any settlement of or
come to any arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation without Parents
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed to the extent that any such compromise, offer, agreement or
arrangement does not involve any monetary payment to any plaintiff or their
counsel).

TERMINATION 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the

contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after shareholder approval thereof:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



57 (b) by either of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, by written notice to the other:

 

(i) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action in each case permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including each of the Merger and the Shareholders Agreement) and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
shall have used all reasonable efforts to challenge such order, decree, ruling
or other action; or

 

(ii) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before January
30, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
hereto may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_
if its failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results
in the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such time; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Outside Date shall be extended day-by-day for each day
during which any party hereto shall be subject to a nonfinal order, decree,
ruling or action restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger; and _provided_ , _further_ , however, that the
Outside Date shall not be extended past April 30, 2015, as a result of the
operation of the immediately preceding proviso;

(c) by the Company:

 

(i) if the required approval of the shareholders of the Company shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote
upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of shareholders at which a quorum of
shareholders was present in person or by proxy, or at any adjournment thereof;

 

(ii) if the Company exercises its rights described in clauses (xx) or
(yy) of  _Section 5.2(b))_; _provided_ that prior thereto or simultaneously
therewith the Company has paid the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance
with _Section 7.3_; or

 

(iii) if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ not to
be satisfied, and (B) cannot be cured or has not been cured prior to the
earlier of (1) one Business Day prior to the Outside Date and (2) the date
that is thirty (30) Business Days after the Company gives written notice of
such breach or failure to perform to Parent; or

 



58 (d) by Parent:

 

(i) if the required approval of the shareholders of the Company shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote
upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at any adjournment
thereof;

 

(ii) if the Board or any committee thereof (a) shall have
withdrawn, qualified, or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw, qualify,
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its adoption, approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger, or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, or (b) shall have approved or recommended, or proposed
publicly to approve or recommend, or taken a neutral position with respect to,
any Takeover Proposal, (c) shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing
actions, or (d) shall have failed to affirm its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement and the Merger within five (5) days of a request to do so by
Parent; or

 

(iii) if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ not to be
satisfied, and (B) cannot be cured or has not been cured prior to the earlier
of (1) one Business Day prior to the Outside Date and (2) the date that is
thirty (30) Business Days after Parent gives written notice of such breach or
failure to perform to the Company.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties hereto specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement (other than  _Sections 5.11_ , _7.2_ , _7.3_ , _7.4_ , _8.4_ ,
_8.6_ , _8.7_ , _8.8_ , _8.9_ , _8.10_ , and _8.11_ hereof) shall forthwith
become null and void, and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, or Merger Sub, or the Company, except as provided in _Section 7.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.2_ shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability resulting from fraud or a willful and material
breach prior to any such termination of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely by the party
hereto that has incurred such fees and expenses. For the sake of clarity, the
cost of preparing printing, and mailing the Proxy Statement shall be borne by
the Company.

 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or _7.1(d)(i)_ or (ii) the Termination Fee is due and
payable to Parent pursuant to

 



59  the circumstances described in _Section 7.3(c)_, then the Company shall
promptly pay Parent an amount equal to all reasonably documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (not to exceed $1,000,000
in the aggregate).

 

(c) In the event that: (i) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made
known to the Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders
generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or _7.1(d)(i)_ hereof, and
within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into an
agreement or a series of agreements for the sale of more than 50% of its
capital stock or assets to one or more third parties other than Parent or its
Subsidiaries; or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ or (iii) the Company breaches, in any material respect, the
provisions contained in either _Section 1.5 _(Shareholders Meeting; Proxy
Statement) or _Section 5.2_ (No Solicitation), in order to accept a Takeover
Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent within one (1) Business Day of
the termination of the Agreement (or in the case of subclause (c)(i) or
(c)(iii) upon the entry of such agreements or series of agreements or
acceptance of a Takeover Proposal, respectively), a termination fee equal to
$7,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement. The fee arrangement contemplated hereby shall be
paid pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_ regardless of any alleged breach by
Parent of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that no payment made by the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall operate or be construed as a
waiver by the Company of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
or of any rights of the Company in respect thereof or as a waiver by Parent or
Merger Sub of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or of any rights of
Parent or Merger Sub in respect thereof; and  _provided_ _further_ , that the
Termination Fee and any reimbursement of expenses due pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ hereof, if paid, shall be credited against any damages recovered by
Parent or Merger Sub from the Company arising from such breach.
Notwithstanding _Section 7.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement,
payment of the fees and expenses described in this _Section 7.3_ shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with any termination of this Agreement in the circumstances in
which the Termination Fee becomes payable. In the event that Parent shall
receive the Termination Fee, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company
or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

 

Section 7.4 _Parent s Liability for Breach_. Notwithstanding anything
in this  _ARTICLE VII_, in the event of a material breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of any of their

 



60  representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company would be entitled to all rights and remedies available
at law or in equity on behalf of itself and its shareholders, including the
right to seek specific performance and to recover damages, including, without
duplication, the loss of the benefit of the Merger to the Company and the lost
shareholder premium and any benefit to Parent or its stockholders arising
from such Parent or Merger Sub breach.

or disabling Shareholder from timely and promptly performing Shareholders
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) Shareholder hereby agrees, if so requested by Parent, (i) that the
Shares held by Shareholder shall bear a legend stating that they are subject
to this Agreement and to an irrevocable proxy and (ii) that, subject to the

any proposal from any Person (other than from Parent or Merger Sub) relating
to any transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal.

(b) During the Support Period, each Shareholder further covenants and
agrees not to participate in any discussions or negotiations (except with
Parent or Merger Sub) regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent
or Merger Sub or if required by law or compelled by subpoena or similar legal
process) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or assist or participate in or facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) to make or effect,
any transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal.

(c) Each Shareholder shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations of Shareholder and
Shareholders agents or other representatives with any Person (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to any of the foregoing. During the
Support Period, each Shareholder shall notify Parent and Merger Sub promptly

identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact and
the material terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry, or
contact.

 



5 (d) Each Shareholder hereby agrees to permit Parent and the Company to
publish and disclose in any materials delivered to the shareholders of the
Company in connection with the Merger Agreement, Shareholders identity and
ownership of Company Common Stock and the nature of Shareholders

the defense of any such litigation and keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. Shareholder agrees that it shall not
compromise, offer to settle, agree to any settlement of or come to any

consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed to the
extent that any such compromise, offer, agreement or arrangement does
not involve any monetary payment to any plaintiff or their counsel).

greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. Shareholder acknowledges
that (a) Shareholder will be receiving valuable consideration in the Merger

interests in the Company in connection with the Merger, and (ii) are deemed

in any material respect or have the effect of preventing, impairing,
or disabling Shareholder from timely and promptly performing Shareholders
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) Shareholder hereby agrees, if so requested by Parent, (i) that the
Shares held by Shareholder shall bear a legend stating that they are subject
to this Agreement and to an irrevocable proxy and (ii) that, subject to the

with, or assist or participate in or facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) to make or effect,
any transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal.
