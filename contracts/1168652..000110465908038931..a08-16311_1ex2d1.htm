 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

 ** **

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " **
_Agreement_** ") is entered into as of June 9, 2008, by and among US
Investigations Services, LLC (" ** _Parent_** "), a Delaware
limited liability company, Hercules Acquisition Corp. (" ** _Purchaser_**
"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and
HireRight, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Company_** ").

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  

 ** **

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Purchaser (the " **
_Purchaser Board_** ") and the Company (the " ** _Company Board_** ") have
determined that it is in the best interests of each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company, respectively, and their respective stockholders and members for
Parent to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and such boards of directors have approved
this Agreement and declared its advisability (and in the case of each of the
Company Board and the Purchaser Board, recommended that this Agreement be
adopted by the Companys stockholders and the Purchasers sole stockholder,
respectively).

  



  

WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger (as defined herein), each issued and
outstanding share (each, a " ** _Share_** ," and collectively, the " **
_Shares_** ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
** _Common Stock_** "), will be converted into the right to receive $15.60
per share in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and certain stockholders of the Company (the " **
_Stockholders_** ") have entered into that certain Voting Agreement, dated as
of the date hereof (the " ** _Voting Agreement_** "), providing that, among
other things, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the
Stockholders will vote in favor of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the
parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

 **I.** THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, (a) Purchaser will merge with and into the Company (the " **
_Merger_** ") and (b) the separate corporate existence of Purchaser will
cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under Delaware
law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " ** _Surviving
Corporation_** ").

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the
Company and Purchaser, the closing of the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") will
take place at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New
York, New York at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a date selected by Purchaser,
but not later than the tenth Business Day following the day on which the last
of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied by action taken
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the

        
   

  



  

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) will
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (the date on
which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " **
_Closing Date_** ").

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Purchaser and the Company will cause a certificate of merger
or such other applicable documents as contemplated by the DGCL (in any such
case, the " ** _Certificate of Merger_** ") to be duly filed, together with
any required related certificates, filings or recordings, with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in such Certificate
of Merger (such time, the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will generally have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Purchaser shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (a)
the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the
Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions,
contained immediately prior to the Effective Time in the certificate of
incorporation of Purchaser until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and as provided by Law, except for Article I thereof,
which shall read "the name of the corporation is HireRight, Inc." and (b) the
bylaws of Purchaser will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable law.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of Purchaser as of the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company as of the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

 **II.** EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company:

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock that is
held in treasury and each share of Common Stock that is owned by Parent or

  



        
   

  



  

Purchaser or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration
will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting Shares (each, an " ** _Excluded
Share_** " and collectively, the " ** _Excluded Shares_** "))
will automatically be converted into the right to receive $15.60 in cash,
without interest (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "), payable upon
surrender of such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.2.

  



  

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) when so cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)
or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) will no longer be outstanding
and all such Shares (other than Excluded Shares) will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.3, each holder
of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares (each, a " **
_Certificate_** ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in
accordance with Section 2.2.

  



  

(d) _Conversion of Purchaser Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), Purchaser will designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") to act as agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance
with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser will deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the
Companys stockholders cash in amounts sufficient for the payment of the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) upon
surrender of such Certificates (such cash being herein referred to as the "
** _Payment Fund_** "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments provided in the preceding sentence out of the
Payment Fund. Purchaser will enter into a paying agent agreement on customary
terms, which terms shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company, prior to the Effective Time. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available) or in money market funds. Any net

  



        
   

  



  

profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be property of and payable to the Surviving Corporation.  To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably
agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Paying Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

(c) _Withholding Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options or Warrants
any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
such payments under the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.
Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holders of Stock
Options or Warrants, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  



  

(d) _No Further Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there will be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent,
they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Article II.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates twelve months after
the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, on demand,
and any holder of a Certificate

  



        
   

  



  

who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of his or her claims for
Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any
other Person will be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.  Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of the Certificates as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in customary amount and upon such terms as the Surviving Corporation may
determine are necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder (a " **
_Dissenting Stockholder_** ") who is entitled to demand, and who
properly demands, appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Section, " ** _Section
262_**" and, such Shares, " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(b), but rather, such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled
only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 262 (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any right with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , that if any
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest thereon) as provided in Section 2.1(b). The Company will
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands to receive fair value for
Shares held by a stockholder, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company
relating to rights to appraisal with respect to the Merger.  The Company
will give Parent and Purchaser the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to assertion of appraisal
rights. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
and Purchaser, make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of
fair value for Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares,

  



        
   

  



  

issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_
that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited or not expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Stock Options and Warrants_

  



  

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (individually a " ** _Stock Option_** "
and collectively, the " ** _Stock Options_** ") outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise will
become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not then vested or subject to
any performance condition that has not been satisfied).

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Stock Option and each warrant to purchase
Shares (individually a " ** _Warrant_** " and collectively, the " **
_Warrants_** ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to any warrant agreement or otherwise shall be cancelled and extinguished and
the holder of such Stock Option or Warrant will, in full settlement of such
Stock Option or Warrant and in exchange for the surrender to the Company of
any certificate or other document evidencing such Stock Option or Warrant,
receive from the Company an amount (subject to any applicable withholding) in
cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Stock Option or
Warrant multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option
or Warrant (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest
whole cent). If the applicable exercise price of any Stock Option or Warrant
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Stock Option or Warrant
shall be cancelled without payment of additional consideration, and all
rights with respect to such Stock Option or Warrant shall terminate as of the
Effective Time. The holders of Stock Options and Warrants will have no
further rights in respect of any Stock Options and Warrants from and after
the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan pursuant to which Stock Options
may be granted (the " ** _Stock Option Plans_** "), subject to consummation
of the Merger, the Stock Option Plans shall terminate, effective as of the
Effective Time and no holder of Stock Options issued pursuant to the Stock
Option Plans or otherwise or any participant in the Stock Option Plans shall
have any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of or, except as
expressly provided in this Section 2.5, to receive any payments from the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of the Company.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and
will take such other actions as may be required to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.5, without paying any consideration or
incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

 **III.** REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in (x) the Company SEC Documents since January 1, 2008
(other than any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any
section relating to or

  



        
   

  



  

containing forward-looking statements, and any other disclosures included
therein to the extent they are generic, customary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature, whether or not appearing in such sections), but only to
the extent the applicability of such disclosure to any representation or
warranty contained in this Article III is readily apparent on its face, or
(y) the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter (the "
** _Company Disclosure Letter_** ") delivered by the Company to Parent and
Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (it being
understood that any matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter will be deemed to be disclosed in any other section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is readily apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other section),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser, as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing, as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization; Power; Qualification_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization.  Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except where the failure to have such authority or power would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially
impair the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole (the " ** _Business_** "). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the assets
and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
its organizational or governing documents.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authorization; Enforceability_

  



  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to adoption
of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to
the execution of this Agreement, duly and unanimously: (i) determined that it
is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Purchaser, (ii)
determined that the consideration to be paid in the Merger is fair to and in
the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (iii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
Companys stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " ** _Company Board
Recommendation_** ").  The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
except in the case of the Merger which is subject to the Requisite Company
Vote.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including,
without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

(a) The Companys authorized capital stock consists solely of (i)
100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred

Shares pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options outstanding as of the
Measurement Date, there has been no change in the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the number of outstanding Stock

purposes of this Agreement, will be deemed to include "phantom" stock or
other commitments that provide any right to receive value or benefits similar
to such capital stock, securities or other rights).  Since the Measurement
Date, there have been no issuances of any securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that would have been in breach of Section 5.1(c) if made
after the date of this Agreement.

and non-assessable and are not subject to any pre-emptive or other similar

awards issued under those Company Stock Award Plans. There are no Company
Stock Award Plans except as set forth in Section 3.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or

or such securities or other rights or (ii) to provide any funds to or make
any investment in (A) any Subsidiary of the Company that is not wholly-owned
by the Company or (B) any other Person.

distribution in respect of any of the Companys securities, and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired any of the Companys securities, and their respective
boards of directors have not authorized any of the foregoing.

  



  

(f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into any commitment,
arrangement or agreement, or is otherwise obligated, to contribute capital,
loan money or otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any
Person.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a complete and correct list of all of the Companys Subsidiaries. All
equity interests of the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights, purchase option, call or right of first refusal or similar
rights, and are owned beneficially, and of record, by the Company, free and
clear of any Liens. Except for the equity interests in the Companys
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, capital stock
or other voting or equity securities or interests (including any securities
convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into capital stock or other voting
or equity securities or interests) in any Person.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Governmental Authorizations_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and will
not require any consent, approval or other authorization of, or filing with
or notification to, any international, national, federal, state,
provincial or local governmental, regulatory or administrative authority,
agency, commission, board, court, tribunal, arbitral body, self-regulated
entity or similar body, whether domestic or foreign (each, a " **

" ** _HSR Act_** "), **** and (B) the competition or merger control Laws of

jurisdiction; and (vi) in such other circumstances where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (ignoring
for this purpose the exception set forth in clause (B) of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect") or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, do not
and will not: (i) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or

obtained or made); (iii) result in any violation or breach of or loss of a
benefit under, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) under, any Company Contract; (iv) require any consent, approval

under any Company Contract; (v) give rise to any termination, cancellation,

including any obligation to purchase, license or sell assets or securities;
or (vi) cause the creation or imposition of any Liens on any Company Assets,
except for Permitted Liens, except, in the cases of clauses (iii) through
(vi), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to materially impair (x) the ability of the Company to consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby or (y) the post-Closing conduct of the
Business.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Voting_.

  



  

(a) The Requisite Company Vote is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
necessary (under the Company Organizational Documents, the DGCL, other
applicable Laws or otherwise) to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.

  



  

(b) There are no voting trusts, proxies or similar agreements, arrangements
or commitments to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or

the Stockholder Agreements. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
instruments of indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
have the right to vote, or that are convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for securities or other rights having the right to vote, on any
matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 3.8 _Financial Reports and SEC Documents_

  



  

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, statements, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to
applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules (the
forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (" ** _SEC_** "), including any
amendments thereto, the " ** _Company SEC Documents_** "). Each of the Company
SEC Documents filed or furnished on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
at the time of its filing (except as and to the extent such Company SEC
Document has been modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC
Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement)
and complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
each of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. As of their respective
dates, except as and to the extent modified or superseded in any subsequent
Company SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company SEC Documents did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.  The Company SEC
Documents filed or furnished on or prior to the date of this Agreement
included all certificates required to be included therein pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the

an SEC review.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Documents (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of
stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Documents (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the net
income, total stockholders equity and net increase (decrease) in cash and
cash equivalents, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to the absence of notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not
be material in amount or effect and to any other adjustments set forth in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement), in each
case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" **
_GAAP_** ") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may
be noted therein.

  



  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required by the Exchange Act
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company ( _i_ ) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including

  



        
   

  



  

its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the
chief financial officer of the Company by others within those entities and (
_ii_ ) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board ( _A_ ) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize or
report financial information and ( _B_ ) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as and to the extent
disclosed, reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company dated as of March 31, 2008 (including the notes thereto) included
in the Company SEC Documents or (ii) as incurred since March 31, 2008 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise
and whether due or to become due, that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since January 1, 2008, (a) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices, (b) there has not been any
Company Material Adverse Effect or any change, event or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (c) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action or agreed to take any action that would
be prohibited by Section 5.1 if it were taken on or after the date hereof
without the consent of Parent.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Litigation_. There are no claims, actions, suits,
demand letters, petitions, grievances, judicial, administrative or
regulatory proceedings, or arbitrations, hearings, notices of violation, or
investigations (each, a " ** _Legal Action_** ") pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any executive officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries which, individually or together with all other Legal
Actions, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse

event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters
from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

3(35) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
4063 or 4064 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

amount of compensation or benefits or the acceleration of the vesting or
timing of payment of any compensation or benefits payable to or in respect of
any current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor
of the Company or any Subsidiary or any increased or accelerated funding
obligation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and any
award thereunder has been operated since January 1, 2005 based upon a good
faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and any

the operation of the Companys or its Subsidiaries businesses infringes,
dilutes (in the case of trademarks), or otherwise violates the Intellectual

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair the conduct of
the Business as currently conducted.

received written notice are currently pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by any person with respect to the Company
Intellectual Property. There are no pending claims by the Company or any of

respect to software owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the rights to distribute, access source code of, or make derivative
works from, software owned by the Company.

such policies.

  



  

Section 3.25 _Affiliate Transactions_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.25(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all balances
between any officer, director or employee of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, other than
ordinary course payroll.

  



  

(b) Section 3.25(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all agreements,
arrangements and other commitments or transactions between (i) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (ii) any member of the Company
Board, any executive officer of the Company or any holder of more than 5% of
the Companys common stock.

  



  

Section 3.26 _Customers and Suppliers_.

  



  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any material customer (i)
will materially reduce the use of services of the Company or (ii) will seek
to reduce the price it will pay for services of the Company, including in
each case as a result of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(b) From the period beginning on December 31, 2007 and ending on the date of
this Agreement, there has not been any material adverse change in the terms

necessary action so that no "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted
under state or federal laws in the United States (including Section 203 of
the DGCL) is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The action of the Company Board in approving this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement (and the transactions provided for herein
and therein) is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement (and the transactions provided for herein and therein) the
restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.

reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 4.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and

(ii) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
any Laws or Orders applicable to Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or by which any assets of Parent or Purchaser or any
of their respective Subsidiaries (" ** _Acquiror Assets_** ") are bound
(assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations, filings and
notifications described in Section 3.6 have been obtained or made), except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement or
Other Filings will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys

time of the Company Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

suits, claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or
investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its Affiliates, other than any such suit, claim, action,

Parent or Purchaser to consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby. As
of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective properties is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award that would, or would reasonably be expected to,
prevent or delay the consummation of, or otherwise materially and adversely
affect the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate, the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Ownership of Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates owns, directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record, any Shares (except for _de minimis_

Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company will provide and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide Parent,
Purchaser and their Representatives, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice (i) such access to the officers, management,
employees, offices, properties, books and records of the Company and such
Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company) as Parent, Purchaser or their Representatives
reasonably may request, except that Parent, Purchaser and
their Representatives shall not conduct any physical testing, sampling or
analysis of soil, subsoil, groundwater, other environmental constituents or
building materials without specific written authorization from the
Company, (ii) within five Business Days of the end of each month following
the date hereof, an unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the month then ended and related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity,
and (iii) such other information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that Parent, Purchaser or their Representatives
reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Purchaser and
their Representatives shall not have access to any books, records and other
information the disclosure of which would, in the Companys good faith
opinion after consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege with respect to such books, records and
other information. The parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply.  Any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.2
that constitutes " ** _Evaluation Material_** " (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall be treated as provided in
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
conditions or agreements of the other parties set forth herein.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Solicitation_

  



  

(a) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
(1) to immediately cease and terminate any discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal and (2)
to request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person or any representative of such Person.
From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize
or permit any Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, cause, knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or other assistance) the
submission of

  



        
   

  



  

any Inquiry or Takeover Proposal, (ii) approve or recommend any Takeover
Proposal, enter into any agreement, arrangement, agreement-in-principle or
letter of intent, or come to any understanding with any Person other than
Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to, or accept, any Takeover
Proposal (or resolve to or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing), or
(iii) initiate, participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or access in connection
with any Inquiry or Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , in response
to a _bona fide_  unsolicited, written Takeover Proposal, made or received
after the date of this Agreement under circumstances not involving a breach
of this Agreement, which the Company Board determines, after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, is reasonably likely to become
a Superior Proposal, the Company may, at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company Board
determines, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) furnish
confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person making such Takeover Proposal and its advisors, but only pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality
agreement shall contain additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3); _provided_ that
the Company shall concurrently provide to Parent a copy of any information or
materials provided to any such Person that have not been previously provided
to Parent, and (y) conduct discussions and negotiate with such Person
regarding such Takeover Proposal, it being understood that such discussions
and negotiations shall not be deemed to be a breach of Section 5.3(a).
The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions
of this Section 5.3(a), and any violation of the restrictions contained
in this Section 5.3(a) by such Representatives shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 5.3(a) by the Company. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of any
"standstill" agreement between the Company and any Person (other than Parent
and any of its Affiliates), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to
any amendment or modification to any such agreement, to permit such Person to
submit a Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within 24 hours), notify Parent (i) of the execution by the Company
and any Person who has made an Inquiry or Takeover Proposal of any
confidentiality agreement (it being understood that the Company shall not
enter into any such agreement that is not an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), (ii) of the commencement of discussions or
negotiations concerning the Company or the terms of any Inquiry or Takeover
Proposal between the Company and any Person who has made any Inquiry or
Takeover Proposal or (iii) of the making of any Takeover Proposal or the
receipt by the Company of any Inquiry, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, identify the Person or Persons making such Takeover Proposal or
Inquiry, describe in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers and the nature of the discussions or negotiations
referenced in clause (ii) above. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis of all material developments affecting the status
or terms of any Takeover Proposal with respect thereto and of the status of
any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding any Takeover
Proposal, including any material change in the terms thereof, and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all related draft term sheets, letters
of intent, agreements and similar documents transmitted by or to the Company.

  



         
 

  



  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board of the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or make any public statement inconsistent
therewith (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
** _Recommendation Change_** ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the
Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior
Proposal or Intervening Event, make a Recommendation Change and, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board may not make a Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement unless (A) the Company Board first determines, after consultation
with its outside legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance (the " ** _Notice
Period_** ") of its intention to make a Recommendation Change in response to
a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event or of its intention to terminate
this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall attach
the most recent version of any written agreement relating to any transaction
that constitutes such Superior Proposal or, if no such agreement exists,
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal or,
in the case of an Intervening Event, describe in reasonable detail such
Intervening Event and (C) Parent does not make, within the Notice Period, a
proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable to the
Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal or obviates the need for a
Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event, as the case may
be.  The Company shall negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. In the
event of a Recommendation Change for any reason other than receipt of a
Superior Proposal, Parent shall have the option, exercisable within five
Business Days after such Recommendation Change, to cause the Company Board to
submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
Section 5.5(b) for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and approving the
Merger.  If Parent does not exercise such option within such period, the
Company may, subject to Section 7.1(h), terminate this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, this
Section 5.3) shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (ii) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), if, in each case, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
that it is required to do so in order to comply with applicable Law,
including its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company, _provided_
that the Company Board shall not, except as expressly permitted by Section
5.3(c), effect a

  



        
   

  



  

Recommendation Change or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Notices of Certain Events_

  



  

(a) The Company will notify Purchaser promptly of (i) any communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and
the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives) and (iii) any Legal Actions threatened or commenced against

related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response
thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives), and
(iv) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or development between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably
likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of
this Agreement not to be satisfied. With respect to any of the foregoing,
the Company will consult with Purchaser and its Representatives so as to
permit the Company and Purchaser and their respective Representatives to
cooperate to take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse
consequences that may result from any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent or Purchaser or the representations or warranties of the Company, or
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Purchaser hereto.

  



  

(b) Parent and Purchaser will notify the Company promptly of (i) any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Purchaser or
its Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from Parent, Purchaser or their Representatives), (iii) any
Legal Actions threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting Parent
or Purchaser that are related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, Purchaser or their
Representatives) or (iv) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or
development between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section
6.1 or Section 6.3 of this Agreement not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(b)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
Company or the representations or warranties of Parent and Purchaser, or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company hereto.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting_

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within 10 Business Days) the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Company Proxy Statement relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall provide
copies of any comments received from the SEC with

  



        
   

  



  

respect to the Company Proxy Statement to Purchaser upon receipt and shall
respond promptly to such comments. As promptly as reasonably practicable,
the Company shall (i) prepare and any amendments or supplements necessary
to be filed in response to any SEC comments or as required by Law, (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to have cleared by the SEC and within five
Business days thereafter mail to its stockholders the Company Proxy Statement
and all other customary proxy or other materials for meetings such as the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (iii) to the extent required by applicable
Law, prepare, file and distribute to the Company stockholders any supplement
or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement if any event shall occur
which requires such action at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and (iv) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with
all requirements of Law applicable to the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Company Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, other
than with respect to statements made based on information supplied in writing
by Purchaser specifically for inclusion therein. Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of the information it supplies in
writing specifically for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company or Purchaser which should be
set forth in a supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement so that
the Company Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and
an appropriate supplement or amendment describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the Company stockholders. Parent and Purchaser shall
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Company Proxy Statement, including furnishing the Company upon request
with information as may be required to be set forth in the Company Proxy
Statement under the Exchange Act.  Prior to filing the Company Proxy
Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto with the SEC or otherwise
communicating with the SEC, the Company will provide Parent and Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents and
communications and shall include in such documents and communications
comments reasonably proposed by Parent or Purchaser. The Company Proxy
Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act. The Company agrees that the Company Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Board Recommendation.

  



  

(b) Unless there has been a Recommendation Change (1) in response to a
Superior Proposal or (2) for any other reason and Parent shall have not
exercised the option set forth in the penultimate sentence of Section 5.3(c),
the Company shall (i) in accordance with applicable Law and its amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, take
all actions necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the

in any event within 20

  



        
   

  



  

Business Days after the Company Proxy Statement is mailed to Company
stockholders, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Company and
Parent); (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the Requisite
Company Vote; and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to retain a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting, and the Company and Parent shall jointly
instruct and receive reports from such proxy solicitor.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Employees; Benefit Plans_

  



  

(a) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2008 (the " ** _Continuation
Period_** "), the Surviving Corporation will provide current employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment
with the Surviving Corporation (" ** _Employees_** ") with compensation and
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided
under the Companys compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies,
practices and arrangements (excluding equity-based programs) in effect at the
Effective Time (it being understood that incentive programs will remain
discretionary); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prevent the
amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or arrangement,
require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the
securities of the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the Surviving
Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from
terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason for which the
Company could have terminated such Employee prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) The Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will honor all Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that
may be permitted by such plans, agreements or written arrangements;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall honor the terms of all
retention and change in control agreements.

  



  

(c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Employees after the
Effective Time (the " ** _New Plans_** "), each Employee will be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before
the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for prior
service), to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before
the Effective Time, to credit for such service under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan, except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined
benefit plans, for any purpose where service credit for the applicable period
is not provided to participants generally, and to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits.  In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing (i) each Employee
immediately will be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " ** _Old Plans_** ") and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Employee, the Surviving

  



        
   

  



  

Corporation will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Employee and his or
her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements
were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  



  

(d) This Section 5.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.6,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.6.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 5.6 will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing
in this Section 5.6 is intended to amend any Company Benefit Plan, or
interfere with Parents or the Surviving Corporations right from and after
the Effective Time to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or the
employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent
contractor or consultant.

  



  

(e) On and after the date hereof, no future offering periods will be
commenced under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" ** _ESPP_** ").
All offering periods in progress on the date hereof shall cease, and the
Company shall terminate the ESPP, on the earlier of (i) the NASDAQ trading
day immediately prior to the Closing Date or (ii) September 30, 2008. On such
date, all rights of each participating employee then outstanding shall be
deemed to be automatically exercised and each participating employee will be
credited with the number of Shares purchased for his or her account under the
ESPP during such offering period. With respect to persons participating in
the ESPP on the date on which the offering period ceases and the ESPP
terminates (and who have not withdrawn from or otherwise ceased participation
in such plan prior to such date), accumulated contributions will be applied
on such date to the purchase of Shares in accordance with the ESPPs terms
(treating the date of termination as the last day of the relevant offering
period). The Company Board shall send written notice that the Merger will
result in the termination of the ESPP to all participating employees not
later than ten Business Days after the date hereof. With respect to
matters described in this Section 5.6(e), the Company will communicate
with Purchaser prior to sending any material notices or other
communication materials to its employees (and reasonably consider Purchasers
comments with respect thereto).

  



  

Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_

  



  

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in which any present
or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(together, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") is, or is threatened to

  



        
   

  



  

be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, any action or failure to take
action by any such Person in such capacity taken prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation (the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") will, from
and after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to
the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law, and as may
otherwise be required by the Company Organizational Documents (or any similar
organizational document), when applicable, and any indemnity agreements
applicable to any such Indemnified Party or any Contract between an
Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
in effect on the date of this Agreement and made available to Purchaser,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, legal and other
expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable legal and other fees and
expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party), judgments and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by such
Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in
advance if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under
applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Surviving Corporation will (i) maintain in effect for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in
the aggregate to the directors and officers of the Company) or (ii) obtain as
of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six
years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " ** _Maximum
Premium_** "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can
only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain that amount of directors and officers
liability insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.  The Company represents that its current annual
premium for directors and officers liability insurance is set forth in
Section 5.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.7 will survive the Closing and, after
the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives
after the Effective Time and their rights under this Section 5.7 are in
addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational
document) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries shall include and maintain in effect in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational document)
for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions regarding the
elimination of liability of directors (or their equivalent), indemnification
of officers and directors thereof and advancement of expenses which are, in
the aggregate with respect to each such entity, no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
Company Organizational Documents.

  



  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the applicable
successors, assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.7.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of the parties to this Agreement
will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
ensure that the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI are
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) making, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days), an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and not extending any waiting period under
the HSR Act or entering into any agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (the " ** _FTC_** ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the " ** _Antitrust Division_** ") not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, (iii) making, as promptly as
practicable, appropriate filings under any other antitrust, competition or
premerger notification, trade regulation law, regulation or order, (iv)
obtaining all necessary consents and waivers under any and all Contracts,
Leases and Permits to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits under such Contracts, Leases or Permits following the consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (such consents or
waivers to be obtained by the Company in consultation with Parent) and
obtaining all consents, approvals or waivers from, or taking other actions
with respect to, third parties necessary to be obtained or taken in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
,  _however_ , that without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
the Company and its Subsidiaries may not pay or commit to pay any amount of
cash or other consideration, or incur or commit to incur any liability or
other obligation, in connection with obtaining such consent, approval or
waiver, (v) subject to first having used reasonable best efforts to negotiate
a resolution of any objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, defending and contesting any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions 

  



        
   

  



  

contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed, and (vi) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Parent, Purchaser and the Company will cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and
any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.8, subject to
applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed material written communication to any
Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies
of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence
between such party (and its Representatives) and any Governmental Entity and
any other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a
Governmental Entity or received from a Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that material may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (y) as necessary to address good faith legal privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company will promptly inform the other
party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent, Purchaser or the Company (or any
of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. The parties agree not to
participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate, in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it so consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Each
party will advise the other party promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the first party proposes
to make or enter into with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws, including (subject
to first having used reasonable best efforts to negotiate a resolution to any
such objections) contesting and resisting any action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Purchaser
shall take any and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i)
selling or

  



        
   

  



  

otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company, Parent
or Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or
other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or

case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with the FTC or Antitrust Division in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets; by consenting to such action by the Company and _provided_ , that any
such action may, at the discretion of Parent or the Company, be conditioned
upon consummation of the Merger) (each a " ** _Divestiture Action_** ") to
ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any
law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently
restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger (an " **
_Antitrust Prohibition_** "); _provided_  that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall be obligated to take or agree to any Divestiture Action that would,
individually or in the aggregate with any other Divestiture Action,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Business,
Parent or the Combined Company (any of the foregoing, a " ** _Burdensome
Condition_** "). For purposes of determining whether any Divestiture Action
constitutes, individually or in the aggregate with any other Divestiture
Action, a Burdensome Condition, (x) any loss of anticipated synergies or
reduction in anticipated return from the transactions contemplated hereby as
a result of any such Divestiture Action shall be taken into account, and (y)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the Combined Company,
shall each be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities having the size
and scale of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

(e) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent or Purchaser requires
action by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their
businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser hereby agree to consent to the taking of such
action by the Company and any such action may, at the discretion of Parent or
the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company. Thereafter, no party
shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statements about
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without first obtaining the consent of the other parties, except to the
extent that the party issuing such press release or making such public
statement determines in good faith it is required to do so by applicable Law,
the NASDAQ requirements or any obligations under Contracts relating to
indebtedness, in which case such party will use all reasonable efforts to
consult with the other parties before issuing any such release or making any
such public statement.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the

as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

all Expenses will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.3.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover, business combination,
control share acquisition, fair price, moratorium or similar statute is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Board will (a)
take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, (b) assist in any challenge to the validity or
applicability to this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement of any state takeover law,
and (c) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover
statute.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Resignations_. At the request of Parent, the Company
shall provide Parent with a true and accurate list of the directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. From and after the date of delivery of such
list, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of changes to such list. The
Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent at the Closing written evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the
Effective Time of those directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
designated by Parent to the Company.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take

such matters.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Company SEC Documents_. Each of the Company SEC Documents

respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
SOX. Any Company SEC Documents that will be filed subsequent to the date of

order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

Parent or Purchaser or by the End Date;

  



  

(f) by either Parent or the Company if this Agreement shall fail to receive

such party); _provided_ , _however_ , that Section 5.11, this Section 7.2,
Section 7.3 (including with respect to any Termination Fee, Early Termination
Fee and/or Acquiror Expenses, as applicable, that may be payable pursuant
thereto) and Article VIII, will survive any termination of this Agreement,
and, _provided_ , _further_ that nothing herein shall relieve a party from
liability as a result of the willful and material breach by another party.
Parent and Purchaser are not relieved of liability if this Agreement is
terminated by the Company because of a breach of Section 4.7 or the failure
of Purchaser to close if the conditions to closing are satisfied. For the
avoidance of doubt, in circumstances in which liabilities or damages are
permitted to be recovered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, Parent
and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the liability or damages suffered or
to be suffered by the Company shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs and may include the benefit of the bargain
lost by the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses Following Termination_

  



  

(a) The Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or to accounts
designated by Parent in writing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to $5,365,000 (the " ** _Termination Fee_** "):

terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(f), and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a Contract providing for the implementation of any
Takeover Proposal or consummates any Takeover Proposal (which in each case
need not be the same Takeover Proposal as the Takeover Proposal described in
clause (A) above), in which event payment of the Termination Fee will be made
on or prior to the earlier of the date on which the Company enters into
such Contract and the date on which the Company consummates such
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of the foregoing clause (C) only, references
in the definition of the term "Takeover Proposal" to the figure "15%" will be
deemed to be replaced by the figure "66%;"

  



  

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g)
(which termination, for purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(ii), shall be deemed
to occur upon the event giving rise to such termination right), in which
event payment of the Termination Fee will be made within two Business Days
after such termination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (x) prior to the date that is
40 days from the date of this Agreement (the " ** _Early Termination
Period_** ") or (y) as the result of a Takeover Proposal by any Person made
during the Early Termination Period, then such payment shall instead be for
$1,950,000 (the " ** _Early Termination Fee_** "); or

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(h), in which event payment of the Termination Fee will be made in advance
of or concurrent with such termination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h) (x)
prior to the expiration of the Early Termination Period or (y) as the result
of a Takeover Proposal by any Person made during the Early Termination
Period, then such payment shall instead be the Early Termination Fee.

  



  

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f),
under circumstances in which the Termination Fee or Early Termination Fee is
not payable, then the Company shall pay as promptly as possible (and, in any
event, within five Business Days after a request therefor) all Expenses of
Parent and Purchaser up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000 (the " ** _Acquiror
Expenses_** "), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the existence of circumstances
which could require the Termination Fee or Early Termination Fee to be
subsequently payable shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay
the Acquiror Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)(iv), and _provided_ ,
_further_ that the payment by the Company of Acquiror Expenses pursuant to
this Section 7.3(a)(iv) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee or Early Termination Fee
(provided that any such subsequent payment of the Termination Fee or Early
Termination Fee will be reduced by the amount of the Acquiror Expenses paid
by the Company).

  



  

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
that without these agreements Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 do not
constitute a penalty. Upon payment of the Termination Fee, Early Termination
Fee and/or Acquiror Expenses, in accordance with this Section 7.3, the
Company shall have no further liability to Parent or Purchaser with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for
liability for any fraud or willful breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement.  In the event that the Company shall fail to pay
the Termination Fee, Early Termination Fee and/or Acquiror Expenses when due,
the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses incurred by
Parent or Purchaser (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection
with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 7.3.  For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event will more than one termination fee be owed by
the Company to Purchaser.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this
Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
stockholder approval hereof, so long as (a) no amendment that requires
further stockholder approval under applicable Laws after stockholder approval
hereof will be made without such required further approval and (b) such
amendment has been duly authorized or approved by each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may, unless prohibited by applicable Laws, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations of the other party, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this
Agreement, or (c) waive

  



        
   

  



  

compliance with any of the covenants or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such
party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this

of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.5
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.  Consequently,

and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

a suitable and

  



        
   

  



  

equitable provision will be substituted for that provision in order to carry
out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that
provision, or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.

benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
