      | ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER 
---|--- 

 

      | Section 1.01 _The Offer_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and that none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of clause (iv) of _Annex A_ shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable and in any event no more than six (6) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Offeror shall, and Parent shall cause Offeror to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange_ _Act_ "), the Offer. The obligation of Offeror to, and of Parent to cause Offeror to, accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered shall be subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the " _Tender_ _Offer Conditions_ ") and the procedural and customary terms set forth in the Offer Documents; _provided_ that Parent and Offeror may, without the consent of the Company (but, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Sections 1.01(c)_ and _1.01(d)_ ), increase the Offer Price and waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company) and make changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Offeror nor Parent may change the form of consideration to be paid, decrease the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open, or modify any of the Tender Offer Conditions or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. 

 

 (b) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and that none of the events described in 

  paragraphs (a) through (c) of clause (iv) of _Annex A_ shall have occurred and
be continuing, as promptly as practicable and in any event no more than six
(6) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Offeror shall
file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended and supplemented from time to time,
the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which shall comply in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities Laws,
and shall contain or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase relating
to the Offer and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement other appropriate documents (which documents, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, are referred to herein collectively as the "
_Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Offeror further agree to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent and Offeror all information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s stockholders that may be required under
the Exchange Act or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.01_. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents,
and Parent and Offeror shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel prior to their filing with
the SEC (it being understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide
any comments thereon as soon as practicable). Parent and Offeror agree to
provide the Company (in writing, if written), and to consult with the Company
and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and
oral comments and proposed responses. Each of Parent, Offeror and the Company
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Parent and Offeror further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in
each case, as and to the extent required by Law.

 

 (c) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , the "initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer" shall be twenty (20) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after (and including the day of) the date of its commencement (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration_ _Date_ "). Offeror shall not, and Parent agrees that it shall cause Offeror not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_ hereof; _provided_ that Offeror shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Offeror to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Offeror and Parent may, without receiving the consent of the Company, extend the Expiration Date for any period required by applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the NASDAQ Global Market or any other stock exchange

  or automated quotation system applicable to the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Offeror shall, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , extend the Offer from time to time if
at any scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any of the Tender Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived; _provided_ that such
extension shall be for a period that is not more than seven (7) Business Days
after such previously scheduled Expiration Date (unless otherwise reasonably
agreed by the parties); _provided_ , _further_ , that Offeror shall not be
required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Offeror to, extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date. In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but
Parent does not acquire a number of shares of Company Common Stock sufficient
to enable a Short Form Merger to occur (assuming exercise of the Top-Up Option
in full), Offeror may, without the consent of the Company, undertake one or
more "subsequent offering periods" for the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act for a number of days to be determined by Parent,
which shall be not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days
in the aggregate (it being understood that any "subsequent offering period"
shall not extend the Expiration Date).

 

 (d) Subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waiver by Parent or Offeror) of the Tender Offer Conditions, Offeror shall, and Parent shall cause Offeror to, immediately accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the first date of acceptance for payment and payment, the " _Acceptance_ _Date_ " and the time of acceptance for payment and payment on the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") on or after the Expiration Date. If Offeror shall commence a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Offeror shall immediately accept for payment and pay as soon as possible for all additional shares of Company Common Stock tendered during such subsequent offering period, subject to and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14d-11(e) under the Exchange Act. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Offeror on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Offeror becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

 

 (e) Offeror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer (or in connection with any subsequent offering period) any such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and all such amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the applicable holder of shares of Company Common Stock. 

 

      | Section 1.02 _Company Actions_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) The Company hereby approves this Agreement and consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation, subject only to the CompanyÂ’s rights to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.05_. The Company 

  hereby represents and warrants that it has been advised that, as of the date
hereof, each of its directors and executive officers intends, as of the date
hereof, to tender pursuant to the Offer any and all shares of Company Common
Stock owned by such director or officer beneficially or of record, other than
shares of Company Common Stock that remain subject to unexercised Company
Stock Options and other than shares of Company Common Stock that may be sold
pursuant to any Rule 10b5-1 plan in effect on or prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 

 (b) The Company shall file with the SEC, on the same date as Parent and Offeror shall file the Schedule TO, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall reflect, subject only to the provisions of _Section 5.05_ , the Company Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to stockholders of the Company as required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. To the extent practicable, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Offeror in mailing or otherwise disseminating the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer Documents to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel (it being understood that Parent and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as practicable). The Company agrees to provide Parent (in writing, if written), and to consult with Parent and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and proposed responses. Each of the Company, Parent and Offeror shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. 

 

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with (or cause Parent to be provided with) mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as of a recent date, and shall provide Parent with such information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the stockholders of the Company. 

 

      | Section 1.03 _Board Representation_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, immediately upon payment by Offeror for shares of Company Common Stock accepted at the Acceptance Time,

  and from time to time thereafter as shares of Company Common Stock are
acquired by Parent or Offeror, Parent shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the
Board of Directors of the Company as will give Offeror representation on the
Board of Directors of the Company of at least that number of directors which
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant
to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Offeror (including for
purposes of this _Section 1.03_ such shares of Company Common Stock accepted
for payment) bears to the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause ParentÂ’s
designees to be elected or appointed to the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors,
including, subject to applicable Law and the CompanyÂ’s Certificate of
Incorporation, increasing the size of the Board of Directors and/or securing
the resignations of incumbent directors. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the same
percentage as is on the entire Board of Directors of the Company (after giving
effect to this _Section 1.03(a)_ ) to be on (i) each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company and (ii) subject to applicable Law and the CompanyÂ’s
Certificate of Incorporation, each Board of Directors and each committee
thereof of each Subsidiary of the Company. The CompanyÂ’s obligations to
appoint designees to its Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable Law, and subject
to Parent supplying the Company with the information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, at the request of
Parent, the Company shall promptly take, at its expense, all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.03(a)_ and shall include in the
originally filed Schedule 14D-9 and otherwise timely mail to its stockholders
all necessary information to comply therewith. Parent will supply to the
Company, and be solely responsible for, all information with respect to itself
and its officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 under the Exchange Act. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
from and after the Acceptance Date, the Company shall be a "controlled
company" (within the meaning of the listing requirements of NASDAQ).

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Acceptance Time until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause its Board of Directors to always have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date hereof, who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates, stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ that, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate, stockholder or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; 

  _provided_ , _further_ , that the remaining Continuing Directors shall fill
such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days, and further provided that if no such Continuing Director is
appointed in such time period, Parent shall designate such Continuing
Director(s); _provided_ , _further_ , that if no Continuing Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate two (2) Persons who shall not be
Affiliates, stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of any of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of any obligation of, or action hereunder by, Parent or Merger Sub (or Offeror), (iii) exercise, enforce or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (iv) take any action to seek to enforce any obligations of Parent or Merger Sub (or Offeror) under this Agreement or (v) take any other action by the Company under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) at the reasonable expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Date, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have received at least three (3) Business DaysÂ’ prior notice of the commencement of any such action. 

 

      | Section 1.04 _Top-Up Option_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Offeror an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 1.04_ , to purchase up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Offeror and its Subsidiaries) at the time of such exercise, shall constitute the least amount reasonably required so that Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, own more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after exercise of the Top-Up Option at a price per share as set forth below; _provided_ that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the CompanyÂ’s then authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock. The purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be equal to the Offer Price, which price shall be payable either, at OfferorÂ’s election, (A) entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by the issuance of a full recourse note with a principal amount equal to the remainder of the exercise price. 

  (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Offeror, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the Acceptance Time (so long as the exercise of the Top-Up Option would, after the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder, be sufficient to allow the Short Form Merger to occur), and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Offeror or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Offeror constitutes more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (C) Offeror has accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. 

 

 (c) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with _Section 1.04(a)_ , Parent shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by Parent, Offeror or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Offeror immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (and the Company shall issue the Top-Up Option Shares at such designated time). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Offeror of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Offeror, as the case may be, shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ , and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Offeror a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

 

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares which Offeror may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Offeror is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Offeror for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 (c) each share of capital stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided in _Section 2.06(a)_ , shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

      | Section 2.07 _Surrender and Payment_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company, that has been approved in advance by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to act as disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration 

  upon surrender of certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub will enter into
a disbursing agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent and, at or essentially
simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
deposit with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to
make the payments pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_ to and for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such amounts being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), with such cash to be held in trust by
the Disbursing Agent, pursuant to the terms of the disbursing agent agreement
referenced above, for the benefit of such holders of such shares. The
Disbursing Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Merger Sub;
_provided_ that any such investments shall be limited to (i) direct short-term
obligations of the United States of America, or (ii) short-term obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged
to provide for the payment of principal and interest; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section
2.06(b)_ shall be promptly paid to Parent. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of any
investment losses.

 

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter, the Disbursing Agent shall mail to each Person who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock which were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_ , a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the outstanding certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent and, in the case of non-certificated shares represented by book-entry which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry_ _Shares_ "), delivery shall be effected only after complying with reasonable delivery procedures established by the Disbursing Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Company, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are reasonable and customary in transactions such as the Merger) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Disbursing Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding of Taxes, and such Certificate and Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest 

  will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

 (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

 

 (d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.07_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest. 

 

 (e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this Article II. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed. 

 

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Disbursing Agent to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. At any time more than six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable, 

  without interest, upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
held by them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time
when such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.

 

 Section 2.08 _Company Stock Options, RSUs and Deferred Equity Units_.

 

 (a) Each Company Stock Option that is not fully vested and exercisable and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall automatically become fully vested and exercisable effective as of the Acceptance Time. On the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Option Consideration multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. The Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this _Section 2.08(a)_ as soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Acceptance Time. 

 

 (b) Each RSU that is not fully vested and exercisable and that is outstanding upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time shall automatically become fully vested effective as of the Acceptance Time. On the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, each outstanding RSU shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration. The Company shall pay the holders of RSUs the cash payments described in this _Section 2.08(b)_ as soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Acceptance Time is not a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then any RSUs that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall vest as of the Acceptance Time but amounts in respect thereof shall be payable upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (or any earlier event as permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the imposition of any excise tax thereunder). 

 

 (c) Effective as of the Acceptance Time, all amounts held in participant accounts and denominated in Company Common Stock either under the CompanyÂ’s Directors Deferred Compensation Plan or pursuant to individual deferred compensation agreements shall automatically become fully vested (based on a deemed achievement of any applicable performance targets at the maximum level) and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the 

  Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock deemed held in such participantÂ’s accounts (" _Deferred
Equity_ _Units_ "). Such obligation shall be payable or distributable in
accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or arrangement relating to
such Deferred Equity Units and prior to the time of any distribution, such
deferred amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in another
investment option under the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement, as
elected by the participant.

 

 (d) At the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the amounts determined as set forth in _Sections 2.08(a)_ through _(c)_ above in respect of the Company Stock Options, RSUs and Deferred Equity Units. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 2.08_ to the holder of any Company Stock Option or RSU, as applicable, shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws and (iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option or RSU, as applicable, for all purposes under this Agreement. Immediately following the payments described in _Sections 2.08(a)_ and _(b)_ , respectively, and the conversion described in _Section 2.08(c)_ , each Company Stock Option, RSU and Deferred Equity Unit, respectively, shall be cancelled and, from and after the Acceptance Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Stock Options, RSUs or Deferred Equity Units. After the holders of all outstanding Company Stock Options and RSUs have been paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the CompanyÂ’s 2003 Stock Option Plan, 2004 Non-Executive Director Stock Option Plan, 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan and 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan, respectively, shall be terminated and no such Company Stock Options or RSUs shall be outstanding. 

 

 (e) The Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required or appropriate such that, upon the Acceptance Time, each Company Stock Option, RSU and Deferred Equity Unit are treated in accordance with this _Section 2.08_. 

 

      | Section 2.09 _Dissenting Shares_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting_ _Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such 

  Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest,
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration for such shares, without any interest. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.09_ , if the Merger is rescinded
or abandoned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the right of
any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholderÂ’s Dissenting
Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its
obligations under the DGCL with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares.

 

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

 

 Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of Company Common Stock, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

 

 Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Disbursing Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

 

 Section 2.12 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

  contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate in a manner that

of Parent, Merger Sub) fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

 Section 5.05 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors or officers, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent, representative or Affiliate (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, except as otherwise expressly provided below: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, result in or facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide to any Person any information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual confidentiality obligation of any Person other than Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (acting on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or at their direction) shall be a breach of this _Section 5.05(a)_ by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors and officers to, and shall use its reasonable 

  best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Date, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) is likely to result in or constitute a Superior
Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof, the
Company may, provided that the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with this _Section 5.05(a)_ , (A) provide information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided
to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

 

 (b) The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or the stockholders of any Person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

 (c) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such Person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or 80% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any break-up fee, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) and the Person making the proposal to be (A) more favorable to the 

  stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any changes
to the financial terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise, including the certainty of the terms offered by Parent or
lack thereof) and (B) reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set
forth in the proposal.

 

 (d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation, or (y) take any other action or make any public statement in connection with the Company Recommendation or Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting with the intent and effect of being adverse in any material respect with the Company Recommendation or adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the Company, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company_ _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood and agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, on no more than one (1) occasion in total with respect to any Takeover Proposal (unless such Takeover Proposal shall have been materially modified in good faith), shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.05(a)_ ) or any tender offer constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date and subject to _Section 5.05(e)_ , the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. 

 

 (e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section 5.05(a)_ , the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within the earlier of one (1) Business Day and 48 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and material terms (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly 

  provide to Parent (and in any event within the earlier of one (1) Business Day
and 48 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all Takeover
Proposals and related agreements, draft agreements exchanged by the parties
and material modifications thereof.

 

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.05_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and, to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement (including, if applicable, the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ ) and (ii) in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by _Section 5.05(d)_.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC or its staff to such Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after filing. Parent shall provide all information as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the SEC or its staff advises the Company that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as of the record date for the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company (including documents incorporated by reference therein) without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to 

  the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information.

  technology offered for sale, license or distribution by Parent or Merger Sub
that is primarily used for the same purpose as any product, service or
technology offered for sale, license or distribution by the Company, shall
have access to any information concerning the current or future prices for,
information or projections relating to future prices of, or contract offers
related to such products. If any of the information or material provided
pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ includes materials or information subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, each party understands and agrees that the parties have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire,
intention and mutual understanding of the parties that the sharing of such
material or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish
in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the
Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to
such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine.

 

 (b) Parent shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), underwriters and their Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company or any of its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of September 25, 2006 between Parent and the Company (as amended by the letter agreement, dated November 16, 2007, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

or such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto in
such defense. The Company agrees that in the event there is a second request
for information in connection with the partiesÂ’ filings under the HSR Act, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to be in substantial compliance
with such request as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event will be
in substantial compliance with such request within two (2) weeks of the time
that Parent informs the Company that Parent is in substantial compliance with
such request.

 

 (c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any Action is instituted by any Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Antitrust Law or other applicable Law, Parent shall, subject to _Sections 6.04(d)_ and _6.04(e)_ , use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity may have to such transactions under such Law with the goal of enabling the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to or entering into one or more settlements, undertakings, conditions, consent decrees, stipulations and other agreements with or to one or more Governmental Entities (each, a " _Settlement_ ") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including one or more Settlements that require Parent or, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company, to restructure the operations of, and sell or otherwise divest or dispose of its or its respective SubsidiariesÂ’ assets, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in effectuating the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the consent of Parent, and (ii) Parent shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the consent of the Company if such actions would bind the Company to do something irrespective of whether the Merger occurs. In addition, Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall, subject to the preceding sentence, use their respective reasonable best efforts to seek to lift, reverse or remove any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or decree under any applicable Antitrust Law. If the Parties have not received all requisite clearances or approvals from Governmental Entities by the date that is four (4) months from the date of this Agreement (provided that if the Outside Date shall have been extended to nine (9) months in accordance with _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ , the reference to four (4) months in this sentence shall be deemed to be six (6) months), then Parent shall, subject to _Section 6.04(e)_ , use best efforts to obtain all such clearances and approvals as soon as possible.

  with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding ParentÂ’s
rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the prior sentence, Parent shall
not require the Company to, and the Company shall not be required to, take any
action with respect to any applicable Antitrust Law which would bind the
Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger occurs.

 

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.04_ shall (i) limit either the CompanyÂ’s or ParentÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII so long as such party has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.04_ ; (ii) require any party to materially amend this Agreement or to waive or forbear from exercising any of its material rights or material remedies under this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to clause (iii) below, any divestitures; holding separate; entering into or amending contracts or government authorizations, and any conduct restrictions agreed to or taken by the Parties pursuant to _Section 6.04_ shall not be considered material for this clause (ii)); or (iii) require Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to (A) agree to or to effect any divesture, hold separate or similar agreement with respect to any business or assets or (B) agree to enter into, or amend, or agree to amend, any material Contracts or material governmental authorizations or take or refrain from taking any other material action or material conduct of any business that, with respect to this clause (B), is adverse in any material manner (the matters in clause (A) or (B), " _Adverse Conditions_ "), if the aggregate revenues generated from assets or businesses subject to Adverse Conditions under clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence exceeds $250 million. For purposes of this subsection, revenues shall be fiscal year 2007 revenues for any Company assets or businesses and calendar year 2006 revenues for any Parent assets or businesses.

hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor (A)
policies of Parent or (B) a non-cancelable run-off insurance policy purchased
by Parent or the Company, in each case containing terms with respect to
coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and
amounts no less favorable to such persons currently covered by the CompanyÂ’s
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing

 (a) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger; 

 

 (b) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.03(a)_ , _Section 3.03(b)_ and _Section 3.03(c)_ not be true and correct in all material respects as of any time of determination as if made at the time of such determination (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case only as of such earlier date), (ii) the representation and warranty of the Company set forth in the first sentence of _Section 3.07_ shall not be true and correct as of any time of determination; or (iii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (without giving effect to any "materiality" or Material Adverse Effect qualifier therein) shall not be true and correct as of any time of determination as if made at the time of such determination (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case only as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; 

  (c) the Company shall have not performed in all material respects any obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under this Agreement prior to the date of determination; or 

 

 (d) the Company shall not have furnished Parent on the Expiration Date with a certificate dated as of the Expiration Date signed on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer to the effect that the conditions set forth in items (b) and (c) of this _Annex A_ shall not have occurred and continue to exist as of the Expiration Date.

The failure by Parent or Offeror at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and waiving such right with respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts or circumstances, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time, in each case prior to the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, tendered shares of Company Common Stock.
