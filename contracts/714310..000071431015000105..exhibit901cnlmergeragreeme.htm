THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 26, 2015 (this
"Agreement"), is among Valley National Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation and
registered bank holding company ("Valley") and CNLBancshares, Inc., a Florida
corporation and registered bank holding company ("Bancshares").

RECITALS

Valley desires to acquire Bancshares, and Bancshares' Board of Directors has
determined, based upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, that
the acquisition is in the best interests of Bancshares and its shareholders.
The acquisition will be accomplished by merging Bancshares into Valley with
Valley as the surviving corporation and, at the same time, merging CNLBank, a
Florida state-chartered commercial bank ("CNL") and wholly owned subsidiary of
Bancshares, into Valley National Bank, a national banking association ("VNB")
and wholly owned subsidiary of Valley, with VNB as the surviving bank, and
Bancshares shareholders receiving the consideration hereinafter set forth. It
is the intention of the parties that the Merger, for federal income tax
purposes, shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as 

Article I. \- THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as hereafter defined), Bancshares shall be merged with and
into Valley (the "Merger") in accordance with the New Jersey Business
Corporation Act (the "NJBCA") and the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA") and Valley shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Immediately following the Effective Time, CNL shall be merged
with and into VNB as provided in Section 1.7 hereof.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects as set forth in
the NJBCA and the FBCA.

1.3 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of Valley
as it exists immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be amended by
the Merger, but shall continue as the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended as provided by law.

1.4 Bylaws. The bylaws of Valley as they exist immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall continue as the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
otherwise amended as provided by law.

1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Valley as of the
Effective Time shall continue as the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.6 Closing Date, Closing and Effective Time. Unless a different date, time
and/or place are agreed to by the parties hereto, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., at the offices of Valley, 1455
Valley Road, Wayne, New Jersey, on a date (the "Closing Date") which is the
last day of the month during which occurs the fifth business day following the
last to occur of the receipt of all necessary regulatory and governmental
approvals and consents and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods in
respect thereof and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the
consummation of the Merger specified in Article VI hereof (other than the
delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents to be
delivered at the Closing), with the exact date determined by the mutual
agreement of Valley and Bancshares. Simultaneous with the Closing, Valley and
Bancshares shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger, in form and
substance satisfactory to Valley and Bancshares, with the Division of Treasury
of the State of New Jersey and the Florida Secretary of State (the
"Certificate of Merger"). The Certificate of Merger shall specify as the
"Effective Time" of the Merger a date and time following the Closing agreed to
by Valley and Bancshares (which date and time the parties currently anticipate
will be at 12:01 am on the date following the Closing Date).

1.7 The Bank Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time, CNL shall be
merged with and into VNB (the "Bank Merger") in accordance with the provisions
of the National Bank Act and, to the extent applicable, the relevant banking
statutes of the State of Florida (the "Banking Law") and the regulations of
the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the "OFR"), and VNB shall be the
surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank"). The Bank Merger shall have the effects
as set forth in the National Bank Act and the Banking Law. Bancshares and
Valley shall cause the Boards of Directors of CNL and VNB, respectively, to
approve a separate merger agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement") in
substantially the form of Exhibit A, annexed hereto, and cause the Bank Merger
Agreement to be executed and delivered as soon as practicable following the
date of execution of this Agreement.

Article II. \- CONVERSION OF BANCSHARES COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS

2.1 Conversion of Bancshares Common Stock; Exchange Ratio; Cash in Lieu of
Fractional Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1
and Section 2.2, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Bancshares ("Bancshares Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares (as such term is
hereinafter defined), and including all unvested restricted stock awards),
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Bancshares, Valley or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be
converted into and become the right to receive that number of shares of common
stock, no par value, of Valley ("Valley Common Stock") equal to the Exchange
Ratio (as hereinafter defined) and, potentially, the cash consideration set
forth in Section 2.1(h). No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be
issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of Bancshares Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest of Valley Common Stock will
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest
by the Average Closing Price as defined below. For purposes of this Section
2.1, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

(A) "Closing Price" shall mean the closing sale price of Valley Common Stock
on a Trading Day as supplied by the New York Stock Exchange (as reported in a
mutually agreed to authoritative source).

(B) "Trading Day" shall mean a day for which a Closing Price is so supplied.

(C) "Average Closing Price" shall mean the average of the Closing Prices on
the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the date which is five (5)
Trading Days prior to the Closing Date.

(D) "Exchange Ratio" shall mean the following:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

If the Average Closing Price is between $8.80 and $10.13, the Exchange Ratio
shall be equal to 0.75 of Valley Common Stock; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Subject to Section 2.1(b) below, if the Average Closing Price is less than
$8.80, the Exchange Ratio shall be $6.60 divided by the Average Closing Price,
rounded to three decimal places; and 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

If the Average Closing Price is greater than $10.13, the Exchange Ratio shall
be $7.60 divided by the Average Closing Price, rounded to three decimal
places. 

(b) If the Average Closing Price is less than $8.80, Valley shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, in lieu of increasing the Exchange Ratio, to
pay an amount of cash for each share of Bancshares Common Stock in an amount
equal to the difference between (A) $6.60 and (B) the product of the Average
Closing Price times 0.75. In the event that Valley chooses this option, the
Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.75, provided, however, that Valley shall not pay
cash to the extent that such payment would result in the Merger failing to
satisfy the continuity of interest requirement applicable to reorganizations
under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code; in the event of any such reduced cash
payment, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.

(c) On or before the Effective Time and in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation of Bancshares, (i) each issued and outstanding share of
Bancshares Series A Preferred Stock and Bancshares Class B Preferred Stock (as
such terms are hereinafter defined) shall be converted into Bancshares Common
Stock and receive the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1 and (ii)
each issued and outstanding share of Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock (as
such term is hereinafter defined) shall be either (A) redeemed by Bancshares
in accordance with the terms of such securities, or (B) at the option of the
holders thereof, converted into Bancshares Common Stock and receive the Merger
Consideration set forth in Section 2.1.

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Bancshares Common Stock held by
Bancshares in its treasury or owned by Valley or by any of Valley's
Subsidiaries (other than Dissenters' Shares (as such term is hereinafter
defined), shares held as trustee or in a fiduciary capacity and shares held as
collateral on or in lieu of a debt previously contracted) ("Excluded Shares")
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration (as
hereinafter defined) shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(e) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Bancshares
Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of Bancshares, except the right to receive the consideration set
forth in this Section 2.1 for each such share held by them. The (i) Valley
Common Stock, (ii), cash delivered pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) and (h), if
any, and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, which any one Bancshares
shareholder may receive pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration" and total number of shares of Valley Common Stock,
plus any cash in lieu of fractional shares which all of Bancshares
shareholders are entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred
to herein as the "Aggregate Merger Consideration".

(f) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, during the
period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the shares of Valley Common
Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within said period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio to provide the Bancshares shareholders with the equivalent
value of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Valley shall
pay for any shares of Bancshares Common Stock and Bancshares Preferred Stock,
the holders of which have exercised their rights under FBCA Sections
607.1302-607.1333 ("Dissenters' Shares") and the holders thereof shall not be
entitled to receive any Merger Consideration; provided, that if appraisal
rights under FBCA Sections 607.1302-607.1333 with respect to any Dissenters'
Shares shall have been effectively withdrawn or lost, such shares will
thereupon cease to be treated as Dissenters' Shares and shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article
II.

(h) If Valley declares a cash dividend on the shares of Valley Common Stock
with a record date within thirty (30) days prior to the day which is five (5)
business days following the last to occur of the receipt of all necessary
regulatory and governmental approvals and consents and the expiration of all
statutory waiting periods in respect thereof and the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger specified in Article
VI hereof (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing), then each share of
Bancshares Common Stock shall be entitled to receive as a part of the Merger
Consideration a cash payment equal to the cash dividend that would have
otherwise been payable assuming such share had been converted to Valley Common
Stock on the record date and at the Exchange Ratio, provided, however, that in
the event the increase in Merger Consideration is effected pursuant to this
Section 2.1(h) in no event shall the holders of Bancorp Common Stock be
treated as shareholders of Valley as of the record date of such dividend.

2.2 Exchange of Shares.

(a) Bancshares and Valley hereby appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of effecting
the conversion of Bancshares Common Stock. Not later than five (5) business
days after the Effective Time, Valley shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of Bancshares Common Stock (other than holders of
Dissenters' Shares) as of the Effective Time (a "Record Holder") a letter of
transmittal in form mutually agreed upon by Valley and Bancshares (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1 hereof.

(b) Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
for such Certificates the Merger Consideration which such Record Holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled. As soon as practicable, but no later than five
(5) business days following receipt of the properly completed letter of
transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, Valley shall cause
the Exchange Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent
shall not be obligated to deliver or cause to be delivered to any Record
Holder the consideration to which such Record Holder would otherwise be
entitled until such Record Holder surrenders the Certificates for exchange or,
in default thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement
and bond as may be required in each case by Valley. Notwithstanding the time
of surrender of the Certificates, Record Holders shall be deemed shareholders
of Valley for all purposes from the Effective Time, except that Valley shall
withhold the payment of dividends from any Record Holder until such Record
Holder effects the exchange of Certificates for Valley Common Stock. Such
Record Holder shall receive such withheld dividends, without interest, upon
effecting the share exchange.

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Bancshares of the shares of Bancshares Common Stock or
Bancshares Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, if any Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration as
provided in Section 2.1 hereof.

(d) If payment of the consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof is to be
made in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(e) Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon Bancshares'
stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions
thereon represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Date, Valley shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Bancshares Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2,
certificates (or other electronic evidence) representing the shares of Valley
Common Stock to be issued to Bancshares shareholders as part of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration plus an estimated aggregate amount of cash to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.1(b), if any, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Valley Common Stock.

2.3 Treatment of Bancshares Stock Options and Stock Awards.

(a) All options which may be exercised for issuance of Bancshares Common Stock
(each, a "Bancshares Stock Option" and collectively the "Bancshares Stock
Options") are described in the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule and are issued
and outstanding pursuant to the Bancshares stock plans described in the
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Bancshares Stock Plans")
and the forms of agreements pursuant to which such Bancshares Stock Options
were granted (each, an "Option Grant Agreement"). True and complete copies of
all outstanding grant agreements for Bancshares Stock Options issued under
Bancshares' Stock Option Plans will be delivered to Valley promptly after
execution of this Agreement.

(b) Holders of unexercised Bancshares Stock Options (including currently
unvested options which would become vested and exercisable as a result of the
Merger or otherwise) will be entitled to receive, in cancellation of their
Bancshares Stock Options, a payment from Valley in Valley Common Stock, in an
amount equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Bancshares Common
Stock into which such Bancshares Stock Options are convertible and (B) the
excess, if any, of (x) the product of the Average Closing Price times the
Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.1(f) hereof
but disregarding Section 2.1(b) hereof), over (y) the exercise price per share
provided for in such Bancshares Stock Option (the "Option Payment"), which
payment shall be treated as compensation and holders shall be responsible for
applicable federal and state withholding Taxes. The fair market value of
Valley Common Stock for purposes of this Section 2.3(b) will be determined by
the Average Closing Price. No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be
issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of Bancshares Stock Options who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest of Valley Common Stock will
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest
by the Average Closing Price. At the time of receipt of such Option Payment,
(i) each holder of a Bancshares Stock Option shall acknowledge in writing, in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Valley that such payment is in full
satisfaction of such holder's rights under such Bancshares Stock Option, or
(ii) or any holders of Bancshares Stock Options whose options are not entitled
to any payment based upon the foregoing, Bancshares shall take such action as
necessary to cancel each Bancshares Stock Option and receive an agreement of
the holders thereof agreeing to such cancellation (in either case, the "Option
Cancellation Agreements"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, no
Bancshares Stock Options will be outstanding.

(c) Bancshares shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time,
each stock settled phantom stock award or stock appreciation right and other
right, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Bancshares
Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares, and each award
of any kind consisting of shares of Bancshares Common Stock that may be held,
awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any Bancshares
Stock Plan (as defined below), other than Bancshares Stock Options (each, a
"Bancshares Stock Award") immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Bancshares or Valley, the holder of that Bancshares
Stock Award or any other person, cancelled and converted into the right to
receive from Valley, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, a payment of an amount, payable in shares of Valley Common Stock,
without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Bancshares Common Stock in respect of such Bancshares Stock Award
multiplied by (y) the Average Closing Price times the Exchange Ratio (subject
to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.1(f) hereof but disregarding Section
2.1(b) hereof), which payment shall be treated as compensation and which
payment shall be treated as compensation and holders shall be responsible for
applicable federal and state withholding Taxes. The fair market value of
Valley Common Stock for purposes of this Section 2.3(c) will be determined by
the Average Closing Price. No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be
issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of Bancshares Stock Awards who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest of Valley Common Stock will
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest
by the Average Closing Price. At the time of receipt of such payment, (i) each
holder of a Bancshares Stock Award shall acknowledge in writing, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Valley that such payment is in full satisfaction of
such holder's rights under such Bancshares Stock Award, or (ii) or any holders
of Bancshares Stock Awards whose options are not entitled to any payment based
upon the foregoing, Bancshares shall take such action as necessary to cancel
each Bancshares Stock Award and receive an agreement of the holders thereof
agreeing to such cancellation.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Bancshares, the Bancshares Board and
the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents)
that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 2.3.

2.4 Valley Shares. The shares of Valley Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger, but along with the
additional shares of Valley Common Stock to be issued as provided in Section
2.1 hereof, shall become the outstanding common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.5 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section
368 of the Code.

3.1 Corporate Organization. (a) Bancshares is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida.
Bancshares has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not have, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bancshares. Bancshares is registered
as a bank holding company under The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHCA"). None of Bancshares' activities require Bancshares to be
a financial holding company under the BHCA.

(b) All of the Subsidiaries of Bancshares are listed in the Bancshares
Disclosure Schedule with a designation of which Subsidiaries are Significant
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Subsidiary" shall mean any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other
entity of which at least a majority of the capital stock or other ownership
interest having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions are at the time
directly or indirectly owned by such person. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Significant Subsidiary" shall mean each Subsidiary which is a
"significant subsidiary" as defined in Regulation S-X, promulgated by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as in effect as
of the date hereof. Each Significant Subsidiary of Bancshares is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state
of incorporation or organization. CNL is a commercial bank chartered under the
laws of the State of Florida whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Each Significant Subsidiary of Bancshares has the power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure of each of
the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Bancshares. The
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule sets forth true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation, articles of association, bylaws or other
comparable formation and governing documents (together the "Bancshares Charter
Documents") of Bancshares and of each Bancshares Significant Subsidiary as in
effect on the date hereof. Except as set forth in the Bancshares Disclosure
Schedule, Bancshares does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any
equity interest in any corporation, company, association, partnership, joint
venture or other entity and owns no real estate, except (i) residential real
estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in each
individual instance with a fair market value less than $500,000 and (ii) real
estate used for its banking premises.

3.2 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of Bancshares consists of
(i) 50,000,000 shares of Bancshares Common Stock, (ii) 1,500,000 shares of
Series A preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "Bancshares Series A Preferred
Stock"), (iii) 1,000,000 shares of Class B preferred stock, $0.01 par value
(the "Bancshares Class B Preferred Stock") and (iv) 40,000 shares of Class C
preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock" and
collectively with the Series A Preferred Stock and Class B Preferred Stock,
the "Bancshares Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof, there were (i)
20,121,835 shares of Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding, and no
shares of Bancshares Common Stock issued and held in the treasury, (ii)
1,134,378 shares of Bancshares Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
and no shares of Bancshares Series A Preferred Stock issued and held in
treasury, (iii) 701,103 shares of Bancshares Class B Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding and no shares of Bancshares Class B Preferred Stock issued and
held in treasury, and (iv) 13,558 shares of Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding and no shares of Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock
issued and held in treasury. As of the date hereof, except for 3,415,000
shares of Bancshares Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock
options granted pursuant to the Bancshares Stock Option Plans, there were no
shares of Bancshares Common Stock or Bancshares Preferred Stock issuable upon
the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise. All issued and
outstanding shares of Bancshares Common Stock and Bancshares Preferred Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, and
nonassessable. The authorized capital stock of CNL consists of 2,000,000
shares of common stock, $5.00 par value per share. As of the date hereof,
there were 558,500 shares of CNL common stock outstanding. Except as set forth
in the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule, neither Bancshares nor any Bancshares
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
transfer, purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock of Bancshares or
any Bancshares Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of such capital stock or any securities
convertible into or representing the right to purchase or subscribe for any
such shares, and there are no agreements or understandings with respect to
voting of any such shares. The Bancshares Disclosure Schedule contains a list
setting forth as of the date of this Agreement all record and beneficial
owners of Bancshares Common Stock and Bancshares Preferred Stock, and, in the
case of the Bancshares Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Bancshares
Common Stock into which shares of Bancshares Preferred Stock will be converted
into as of the Closing.

(b) The Bancshares Disclosure Schedule contains a list setting forth as of the
date of this Agreement (i) all outstanding Bancshares Stock Options, the names
of the option holders, the date each such option was granted, the number of
shares subject to each such option, the expiration date of each such option,
any vesting schedule with respect to an option which is not yet fully vested,
and the price at which each such option may be exercised and (ii) comparable
information for any other outstanding awards under the Bancshares Stock Option
Plans. Each Bancshares Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. The exercise price of each
Bancshares Stock Option is not less than the fair market value of a share of
Bancshares Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Bancshares
Stock Option and within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated
guidance set forth by Treasury. Bancshares has made available to Valley true
and complete copies of all Bancshares Stock Option Plans and the forms of all
award agreements and other agreements evidencing outstanding Bancshares Stock
Options.

(c) The Bancshares Disclosure Schedule lists the name(s), jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, authorized and outstanding shares of capital
stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each
Subsidiary of Bancshares. Except as set forth in the Bancshares Disclosure
Schedule, Bancshares owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity interests in each
of Bancshares' Subsidiaries, free and clear of any lien, claim, charge,
mortgage, pledge, security interest, restriction, encumbrance or security
interest ("Liens"), and all of such shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Neither
Bancshares nor any Subsidiary of Bancshares has or is bound by any right with
respect to the capital stock or any other equity security of any Subsidiary of
Bancshares.

(d) Except (i) as disclosed in the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule, (ii) for
Bancshares' ownership in its Subsidiaries, (iii) for securities held for the
benefit of third parties in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for
the benefit of customers, (iv) for securities acquired after the date of this
Agreement in satisfaction of debts previously contracted in good faith, and
(v) unmarketable Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock,
neither Bancshares nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or controls,
directly or indirectly, any shares of stock or other equity interest in any
corporation, firm, partnership, joint venture or other entity.

(e) Except as set forth in the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule, no bonds,
debentures, trust-preferred securities or other similar indebtedness of
Bancshares (parent company only) are issued or outstanding.

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to

validly approved by the Board of Directors of Bancshares. The execution and
delivery of the Bank Merger Agreement has been duly and validly approved by
the Board of Directors of CNL. Except for the approvals described in paragraph
(b) below, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Bancshares or CNL are
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Bancshares and, assuming
due and valid execution and delivery of this Agreement by Valley, constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of Bancshares, enforceable against Bancshares
in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, whether applied in a
court of law or a court of equity.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Bancshares or the
execution and delivery of the Bank Merger Agreement by CNL, nor the
consummation by Bancshares of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof or the consummation by CNL of the
transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms thereof, or
compliance by Bancshares with any of the terms or provisions hereof or
compliance by CNL with any of the terms of provisions thereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Bancshares Charter Documents, (ii) assuming that
the consents and approvals set forth below are duly obtained, violate any
statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to Bancshares or CNL or any of their respective
properties or assets, or (iii) except as set forth in the Bancshares

of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination

respective properties or assets of Bancshares or CNL under, any of the terms,

trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Bancshares or CNL is a party, or by which either or both of them or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected except, with
respect to (ii) and (iii) above, such as individually and in the aggregate
will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Bancshares. Except for consents and
approvals of or filings or registrations with or notices to the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the FDIC, the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "FRB"), the OFR, the Florida Department of
State, the SEC, and the shareholders of Bancshares, or as listed in the

instrumentality or administrative agency or, to the knowledge of Bancshares,
any third party (other than consents or approvals of third parties the absence
of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Bancshares or CNL) are
necessary on behalf of Bancshares or CNL in connection with (x) the execution
and delivery by Bancshares of this Agreement and (y) the consummation by
Bancshares of the transactions contemplated hereby and (z) the execution and
delivery by CNL of the Bank Merger Agreement and the consummation by CNL of

Bancshares, any other party thereto, under any such Bancshares Contract,
except, in each case, where such invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to
so perform or breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Bancshares.

(c) The Bancshares Disclosure Schedule contains a schedule showing the present
value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such
schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as Tax indemnification payments in respect of income
or excise Taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or
similar contract or plan with or which covers any present or former employee,
director or consultant of Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries and
identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under
any Bancshares Pension Plans, Bancshares Welfare Plans or Bancshares Contract
(other than a Tax-qualified plan) for each such person, specifying the

applicable laws. To Bancshares' knowledge, the buildings, structures, fixtures
and improvements on each parcel of Owned Real Property lie entirely within the
boundaries of such parcel of Owned Real Property. Neither Bancshares nor its

(e) With respect to each Subsidiary indicated on the Valley Disclosure
Schedule as being a real estate investment trust, (x) for all taxable years
commencing with its first taxable year through the taxable year ended December
31, 2014, such Subsidiary has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has
satisfied all requirements to qualify as a real estate investment trust for
such years; (y) has operated since its first taxable year to the date of this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a real estate investment trust; and (z) intends to continue to
operate in such a manner as to qualify as a real estate investment trust for
the current taxable year. None of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will prevent any such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries from so
qualifying. No such Subsidiary of any Subsidiary is a corporation for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, other than a corporation that meets the
requirements of representations (x) and (y) above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to periods prior to the acquisition of the ownership
of each such Subsidiary by Valley, the representations of Valley are made only
to the knowledge of Valley.

4.11 Compliance with Applicable Law.

(a) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, each of Valley and
the Valley Subsidiaries (i) holds all licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of its business, except where
the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Valley, and (ii) has complied with and is not in default in any respect under
any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline
of any Governmental Entity relating to Valley or any of its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, consumer, community and fair lending laws,
other than where any non-compliance or default would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Valley and neither Valley nor any of the Valley Subsidiaries, since
January 1, 2012, has received written notice of such violation of any of the
above that has not been cured.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, except as set forth on the Valley
Disclosure Schedule, VNB has in (i) complied in all material respects with the
CRA, and (ii) to Valley's knowledge, no person or group would object to the
consummation of the Merger due to the CRA performance of or raiding of VNB.

compliance with and have complied with all applicable Environmental Laws, (ii)
neither Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability known or unknown,
contingent or absolute, under any Environmental Law, nor is Valley or any
Subsidiary responsible for any such liability of any other person or entity
under any Environmental Law, whether by contract, by operation of law or
otherwise, (iii) neither Valley nor any Valley Subsidiary has received any
written notice, citation, claim, assessment, proposed assessment or demand for
abatement alleging that Valley or such Valley Subsidiary (either directly or
as a trustee or fiduciary, or as a successor-in-interest in connection with
the enforcement of remedies to realize the value of properties serving as
collateral for outstanding loans) may be in violation of any Environmental Law
or may have any liability under any Environmental Law, and (iv) no toxic or
hazardous substances or materials have been emitted, generated, disposed of or
stored on any real property owned or leased by Valley or any Valley
Subsidiary, OREO or otherwise, or owned or controlled by Valley or any Valley
Subsidiary as a trustee or fiduciary (collectively, "Valley Properties") in
any manner that violates or, after the lapse of time is reasonably likely to
violate, any Environmental Law.

(b) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, to Valley's
knowledge, none of the Valley Properties has been operated in any manner that
violated any Environmental Law, the violation of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Valley.

4.13 Reserves.

(a) The allowance for loan and lease losses in the Valley Financial
Statements, was, as of December 31, 2014, (i) adequate under GAAP, and (ii)
adequate based upon past loan loss experiences and potential losses in the
current portfolio to cover all known or anticipated loan losses.

(b) As of December 31, 2014, the reserve for Taxes as calculated under and
required under FIN 48 is adequate for all contingencies and includes all

is a party to any agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to
any commitment letter, board resolution submitted to a regulatory authority or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a
recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Governmental
Entity which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its
management, except for those the existence of which has been disclosed in
writing to Bancshares by Valley prior to the date of this Agreement, nor has
Valley been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is contemplating
issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or
requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding,
extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter or similar submission.
Neither Valley nor any Valley Subsidiary is required by Section 32 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act to give prior notice to a Federal banking agency
of the proposed addition of an individual to its Board of Directors or the
employment of an individual as a senior executive officer, except as disclosed
in writing to Bancshares by Valley prior to the date of this Agreement.

4.15 SEC Documents; Other Reports; Internal and Disclosure Controls.

(a) Valley has filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and other
documents, together with amendments thereto, required to be filed with the SEC
since December 31, 2012 (the "Valley SEC Reports"). As of their respective
dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing),
the Valley SEC Reports complied, and each such Valley SEC Report filed
subsequent to the date hereof will comply, in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and
did not or will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding comments
from, or unresolved issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the
Valley SEC Reports. None of Valley's Significant Subsidiaries is required to
file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. No executive officer of Valley has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Sections 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to the knowledge of Valley no enforcement action has
been initiated against Valley by the SEC relating to disclosures contained in
any Valley SEC Report.

(b) Valley and each of its Significant Subsidiaries have filed all material
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since
December 31, 2012 with any Governmental Entity (other than the SEC) and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except
as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, no Governmental Entity has
initiated any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Valley, threatened an
investigation into the business or operations of Valley or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries since December 31, 2012. Except as set forth in the
Valley Disclosure Schedule, there is no material unresolved violation,
criticism or exception by any Governmental Entity with respect to any report,
registration or statement filed by, or relating to any examinations by any
such Governmental Entity of, Valley or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Valley and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Valley (A) has designed
disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Valley and its Subsidiaries is made known to the management of Valley by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act with respect to the Valley SEC Reports, and (B) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Valley's
auditors and the audit committee of Valley's Board (1) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect in any material respect Valley's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Valley's auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Valley's internal controls. Valley's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective.

(d) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, since January 1,
2012, neither Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
Valley, any member of Valley's Board of Directors or executive officer of
Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that Valley or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and no attorney representing Valley or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Valley or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to any member of Valley's Board of
Directors or any executive officer of Valley.

4.16 Certain Contracts. Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule,
(i) each Valley contract which is a material contract (as defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed in whole or in part

binding on Valley or its applicable Significant Subsidiary and in full force
and effect, and, to the knowledge of Valley, is valid and binding on the other
parties thereto, (ii) Valley and each of its Significant Subsidiaries and, to
the knowledge of Valley, each of the other parties thereto, has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by such

exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a material breach or default on the part of Valley or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Valley, any other party
thereto, under any such Valley Contract, except, in each case, where such
invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to so perform or breach or default,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Valley.

4.17 Loan Matters.

(a) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, each outstanding
loan (including loans held for resale to investors but excluding any loan
covered by a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC as described in the Valley
Disclosure Schedule) held by Valley or its Significant Subsidiaries (the
"Valley Loans") has been solicited and originated and is administered and,
where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Valley Loan files are being
maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant loan
documents, Valley's underwriting standards (and, in the case of Valley Loans
held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of the
applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of federal, state
and local laws, regulations and rules, except for such exceptions as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Valley. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement,
the representations and warranties of Valley with respect to Valley Loans that
were acquired by Valley or its Subsidiaries from a third party (e.g., in
connection with a merger or other acquisition) shall be made only to the
knowledge of Valley.

(b) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule or as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Valley, each Valley Loan (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) to Valley's knowledge, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles. Except as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Valley, the loan documents with respect to each
Valley Loan were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations at the
time of origination or purchase by Valley or its Subsidiaries and are complete
and correct in all material respects.

(c) Except as listed in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no
employee, officer, director or other affiliate loans on which the borrower is
paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit
agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was below market at
the time the loan was made; and (ii) all such loans are and were made in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, except for such
exceptions as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Valley.

(d) Valley has previously delivered to Bancshares a schedule setting forth (A)
each Valley Loan that as of March 31, 2015 was classified as "Special
Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized,"
"Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar
import by Valley, any of its Subsidiaries or any bank examiner, together with
the principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Valley
Loan, (B) each Valley Loan that was classified as of March 31, 2015 under ASC
310, and (C) each asset of Valley or any of its Subsidiaries that as of March
31, 2015 was classified as OREO and the book value thereof as of such date.
Such schedule is accurate and complete in all material respects.

(e) Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, none of the
agreements pursuant to which Valley or any of its Significant Subsidiaries has
sold loans or pools of loans or participations in loans or pools of loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such loan.

4.18 Reports. Except as set forth in the Valley Disclosure Schedule, VNB has,
since January 1, 2012, duly filed with the OCC, and Valley has duly filed with
the FRB, in correct form all documentation required to be filed under
applicable laws and regulations, and Valley promptly will deliver or make
available to Bancshares accurate and complete copies of such documentation.

OCC, and all examinations of Valley conducted by the FRB since January 1, 2013
and the dates of any responses thereto submitted by VNB and Valley,
respectively.

4.19 Questionable Payments. To Valley's knowledge, neither Valley, VNB nor any
of their Subsidiaries or affiliates has: (a) directly or indirectly, used any
corporate funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other

or domestic governmental official, employee, or agent of any foreign or
domestic government.

4.20 Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Valley has no knowledge of, nor has it been
advised of, or has reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist
that would cause Valley, VNB or any of their Subsidiaries: (i) to be deemed to
have knowingly acted, by itself or in conjunction with another, in any act in
connection with Unlawful Gains, (ii) to be deemed to have knowingly accepted,
transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale, purchase or any

statute, executive order (including, without limitation, the September 24,
2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with
Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other
governmental action. Valley and VNB have implemented an OFAC compliance
program that adequately covers in all material respects all elements of OFAC
compliance, and to the knowledge of Valley and to the knowledge of VNB, no
Subsidiary or affiliate of Valley or VNB is engaging nor has any Subsidiary or
affiliate of Valley or VNB engaged in any dealings or transactions with, and
no Subsidiary or affiliate of Valley or VNB has been otherwise associated
with, such persons or entities.

representatives not to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided that in the event, prior to the time the approval of
Bancshares' shareholders ("Bancshares Shareholder Approval") is obtained but
not after, (1) Bancshares receives, after the execution of this Agreement, an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a person other than Valley,
and (2) the Bancshares Board of Directors concludes in good faith (A) that,
after consulting with its financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to result in a
Superior Proposal and (B) that, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to Bancshares' shareholders under applicable law, Bancshares may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' representatives to, furnish
or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in
negotiations or discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into an
agreement with such third party on terms substantially similar to and no more
favorable to such third party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement between Valley and Bancshares dated February 3, 2015 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and any non-public information provided to any
person given access to nonpublic information shall have previously been
provided to Valley or shall be provided to Valley prior to or concurrently
with the time it is provided to such person. Bancshares will (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Valley
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) not terminate, waive, amend,
release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal to which it or any of its affiliates or
representatives is a party and (C) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

(b) Neither the Bancshares Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Valley) or
refuse to make the Bancshares Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) cause or permit Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the
terms of Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the date of the Bancshares Shareholders Meeting, the Bancshares Board
of Directors may take any of the actions specified in items (i) and (ii) of
the preceding sentence (a "Bancshares Subsequent Determination") after the
second (2nd) business day following Valley's receipt of a written notice (the
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from Bancshares (A) advising that the
Bancshares Board of Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.3 or from an action by a representative of Bancshares or its
Subsidiaries that would have been such a breach if committed by Bancshares or
its Subsidiaries) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that
Bancshares shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in
respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its
affiliates that Bancshares proposes to accept), (B) specifying the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the party making, such Superior
Proposal, and (C) containing an unredacted copy of the relevant transactions
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, if, but only if, (X)
Valley does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to
negotiate with Bancshares, within two (2) business days of receipt of a Notice
of Superior Proposal, a written offer that the Board of Directors of
Bancshares determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal, and (Y) the Bancshares Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to Bancshares' shareholders under applicable law and that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has
been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal
after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that
are committed to in writing by Valley pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Bancshares Recommendation or the making of a Bancshares Subsequent
Determination by the Bancshares Board of Directors shall not change the
approval of the Bancshares Board of Directors for purposes of causing any
takeover laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements
(as hereinafter defined) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Bancshares set forth in Sections 5.3(a)
and (b) of this Agreement, in the event Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries
or representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request
for non-public information or to engage in negotiations that the Bancshares
directors believe is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal, Bancshares promptly (and in any event within two
business days of receipt) shall advise Valley in writing of the existence of
the matters described in this clause (i) or (ii), together with the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity
of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Bancshares
shall keep Valley reasonably well informed in all material respects of the
status (including after the occurrence of any material amendment or
modification) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Without limiting
any of the foregoing, Bancshares shall promptly (and in any event within two
business days) notify Valley in writing if it determines to begin providing
non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) or (b) of this Agreement and shall in no
event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 25% or more of the
voting power in Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, a proposal for a
merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving Bancshares or
any of its Subsidiaries or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner 25% or more of the voting power in, or 25% or more of the business,
assets or deposits of, Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term
changed from 25% to 50%) that the Bancshares Board of Directors concludes in
good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions
proposed by Valley in response to such proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(b) of
this Agreement or otherwise), (1) after receiving the advice of its financial
advisor (which shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (2)
after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction
on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the
terms herein), and (3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law.

(e) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall be
subject to Section 5.3(a) and 5.3(b), and shall not be subject to this Section
5.3(e)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict Bancshares'
Board of Directors from, prior to the receipt of the Bancshares Shareholder
Approval, effecting a Bancshares Subsequent Determination if Bancshares' Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Bancshares'
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of
Bancshares' Board of Directors to effect a Bancshares Subsequent Determination
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

5.4 Current Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, Bancshares will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of Valley regarding Bancshares' business, operations,
properties, assets and financial condition and matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, Bancshares shall provide Valley, on a monthly basis, with a
schedule of all new loans, leases, extensions of credit, and renewal loans,
leases and extensions of credit in excess of $1,000,000, or any increase by
$1,000,000 or more in any customer's aggregate credit outstanding or lease
commitment (whether or not subject to prior approval under Section 5.2(a)),
and provide Valley with a copy of, and the opportunity to discuss, the
relevant documentation for any such loan, extension of credit, lease, or
renewal upon request. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, neither Valley nor any Valley Subsidiary shall under any
circumstance be permitted to exercise control of Bancshares or any Bancshares
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably available, but
in no event more than forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal
quarter ending after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, Bancshares will deliver to Valley CNL's call reports filed with the OFR
and the FDIC.

5.5 Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality.

(a) On reasonable advance notice, Bancshares and CNL shall permit Valley and
its representatives, and Valley and VNB shall permit Bancshares and its
representatives, accompanied by an officer of the respective party, reasonable
access during normal business hours to their respective properties, and shall
make available to Valley and its representatives or Bancshares and its
representatives as the case may be, all books, papers and records relating to
their respective assets, stock ownership, properties, operations, obligations
and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account
(including the general ledger), Tax records, minute books of directors' and
shareholders' meetings, charter documents, material contracts and agreements,
filings with any regulatory authority, independent auditors' work papers
(subject to the receipt by such auditors of a standard access representation
letter), litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business
activities or prospects in which Valley and its representatives or Bancshares
and its representatives may have a reasonable interest. Neither party shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of any customer, violate the
terms of any contract, jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order or judgment. The parties will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Bancshares acknowledges that
Valley may be involved in discussions concerning potential acquisitions of
banks and other entities and Valley shall not be obligated to disclose such
information to Bancshares except as such information is publicly disclosed by
Valley.

(b) Each party will hold any information that is confidential, proprietary or
otherwise non-public in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

5.6 Regulatory Matters.

(a) For the purposes of holding the Bancshares Shareholders Meeting and
qualifying under applicable federal and state securities laws the Valley
Common Stock to be issued to Bancshares shareholders in connection with the
Merger, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45)
days, following the date of this Agreement), the parties shall (i) jointly
prepare, and Valley shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form
S-4, including a prospectus and (ii) jointly prepare, a proxy statement,
satisfying all applicable requirements of applicable state and federal laws,
including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable state securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder (such proxy statement and
prospectus in the form mailed by Bancshares to its shareholders together with
any and all amendments or supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the
"Proxy Statement-Prospectus" and the various documents to be filed by Valley
under the Securities Act with the SEC to register the Valley Common Stock for
sale, including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, are referred to herein as the
"Registration Statement"). Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus and the Registration Statement, each party shall consult with the
other party with respect to such filings and shall afford the other party and
their Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

(b) Each party shall furnish to the other party with such information
concerning itself and its Affiliates as is necessary in order to cause the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and Registration Statement to comply with Section
5.6(a) hereof. Each party agrees promptly to advise the other party if at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information provided by such party in
the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement becomes incorrect or
incomplete in any material respect and promptly to provide the information
needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Each party shall promptly
furnish to the other party such supplemental information as may be necessary
in order to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement to
comply with Section 5.6(a). The information relating to a party to be provided
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
or Registration Statement, any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under
the Securities Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental
Entity in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading.

(c) Valley shall as promptly as practicable make such filings, if any, as are
necessary in connection with the offering of the Valley Common Stock with
applicable state securities agencies and shall use all reasonable efforts to
qualify the offering of such stock under applicable state securities laws at
the earliest practicable date. Bancshares shall promptly furnish Valley with
such information regarding Bancshares shareholders as Valley requires to
enable it to determine what filings are required hereunder. Bancshares
authorizes Valley to utilize in such filings the information concerning
Bancshares and CNL provided to Valley in connection with, or contained in, the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus. Valley shall furnish Bancshares' counsel with
copies of all such filings and keep Bancshares advised of the status thereof.
Valley shall promptly notify Bancshares of all communications, oral or
written, with the SEC concerning the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus.

(d) Valley shall cause the Valley Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Merger, to be listed on the NYSE at the Effective Time.

(e) The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use all reasonable
efforts to prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental bodies necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
possible, including, without limitation, those required by the OCC, the FDIC,
the FRB, the OFR and the Florida Department of State. The parties shall each
have the right to review in advance and comment on all information relating to
the other, as the case may be, which appears in any filing made with, or
written material submitted to, any third party or governmental body in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Valley and
VNB shall use their best efforts to cause their applications to the OCC and
the FRB to be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement.
Bancshares shall cooperate with Valley to provide all information requested in
writing by Valley to complete such application within ten (10) days of request
from Valley. Valley shall provide to Bancshares drafts of all filings and
applications referred to in this Section 5.6(e) and shall give Bancshares the
opportunity to comment thereon prior to their filing.

(f) Each of the parties will promptly furnish each other with copies of
written communications received by them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Bancshares
shall cooperate with Valley to reasonably conform Bancshares's policies and
procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters, to those of Valley as
Valley may reasonably identify to Bancshares from time to time.

5.7 Approval of Bancshares Shareholders. Bancshares will, subject to the
qualification set forth in Section 5.3(b) hereof, (i) take all steps necessary
duly to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders
of Bancshares (such meeting or any adjournment thereof, the "Bancshares
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of securing the Merger and the approval
of shareholders of this Agreement, (ii) recommend to the shareholders of
Bancshares the approval of the Merger and this Agreement and use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable,
such approval. Bancshares and Valley will cooperate with respect to each of
the foregoing matters. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Bancshares shall cause each of the directors of Bancshares in their capacity
as shareholders to execute and deliver to Valley a voting agreement, the form
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Voting Agreements").

5.8 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to satisfy the conditions to the Closing and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any injunction
or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
using its best efforts to prevent the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of such party contained or referred to in this Agreement
and to promptly remedy the same. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
shall take all such necessary action. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to require any party to participate in any threatened or actual
legal, administrative or other proceedings (other than proceedings, actions or
investigations to which it is otherwise a party or subject or threatened to be
made a party or subject) in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless such party shall consent in advance and
in writing to such participation and the other party agrees to reimburse and
indemnify such party for and against any and all costs and damages related
thereto.

5.9 Public Announcements. Bancshares and Valley will consult with each other
before issuing, and will cooperate with each other in the development and
distribution of, all press release and any other public disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
will not issue any press release or written statement for general circulation
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party (but after consultation with the other
party), issue such press release or public statements as may be required by
applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange.

5.10 Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Valley or Bancshares
determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to March 31,
2016 (the "Cutoff Date") and that it will not waive that condition, it will
promptly notify the other party. Bancshares and Valley will promptly inform
the other of any facts applicable to Bancshares or Valley, respectively, or
their respective directors or officers, that would be likely to prevent or
materially delay approval of the Merger by any governmental authority or which
would otherwise prevent or materially delay completion of the Merger.

5.11 Disclosure Delivery and Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior
to the Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly supplement or amend (by
written notice to the other) its respective Disclosure Schedules delivered
pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is necessary
to correct any information in such Schedules which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. If the disclosure contained in any such
supplement (i) relates to events occurring before execution of this Agreement
or (ii) alone or together with other supplements or amendments materially
adversely affects the representation to which the amendment or supplement
relates, the party receiving the amendment or supplement may determine not to
accept it as a modification of the relevant representation. Notice of such
determination, if made, shall be given by the receiving party to the other
party not later than ten (10) days after it received the disclosure in
question. If such notice is not timely given, or if the disclosure in question
did not contain any matter of the nature specified in clause (i) or (ii) of
the second preceding sentence, the relevant representation shall be deemed
modified by the disclosure in the amendment or supplement with the same effect
as though that disclosure had been included in the relevant Disclosure
Schedule as furnished prior to execution of this Agreement.

5.12 Class C Preferred Stock. Not less than 90 days prior to the Closing Date,
Bancshares shall provide notice of the redemption of the Bancshares Class C
Preferred Stock as a result of the Merger to each holder thereof (each, a
"Class C Holder") in accordance with the terms and conditions of Bancshares
Charter Documents. In addition to delivery of such notice, Bancshares shall
advise each Class C Holder of their right to convert the Bancshares Class C
Preferred Stock into Bancshares Common Stock. To the extent that any Class C
Holder does not elect to convert such Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock to
Bancshares Common Stock, Bancshares shall redeem shares of Bancshares Class C
Preferred Stock in accordance with the Bancshares Charter Documents, subject
to receiving prior regulatory approval from the applicable bank regulatory
agencies. Valley may, but shall not be required to, fund the redemption of the
Bancshares Class C Preferred Stock. The method of funding such redemption
shall be mutually agreed to by Valley and Bancshares subject to any regulatory
requirements.

5.13 Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, Valley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Bancshares or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Bancshares Indemnitees") against any and all
claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation, and the reasonable fees
and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and experts as
incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement,
asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any Bancshares Indemnitee
("Costs") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer
of Bancshares or its Subsidiaries, acted as a director or officer of a third
party at the request of Bancshares or its Subsidiaries or acted as a benefits
plan fiduciary, in connection with, arising out of or relating to any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each a "Claim" and
collectively, "Claims"), including without limitation any Claim which is based
upon, arises out of or in any way relates to the Merger, this Agreement, any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Bancshares
Indemnitee's service as a member of the Board of Directors of Bancshares or
any of its Subsidiaries or any committee thereof, the events leading up to the
execution of this Agreement, any statement, announcement, recommendation or
solicitation made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach of
any duty in connection with any of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest
extent which Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would have
been permitted under any applicable law and the Bancshares Charter Documents
had the Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent so permitted); provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such
six year period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any
obligation of Bancshares immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect
to the indemnification of the Bancshares Indemnitees arising out of the
Bancshares Charter Documents of Bancshares or arising out of any written
indemnification agreements between Bancshares and such persons disclosed in
the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule, as if such obligations were pursuant to a
contract or arrangement between Valley and such Bancshares Indemnitees.

(c) In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or
consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business combination
transaction with any other person or entity and is not the resulting,
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or
transaction, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Valley assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

(d) Valley shall cause Bancshares' and CNL's officers and directors to be
covered, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, at Valley's
option, under (i) Valley's then current officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy (providing substantially similar coverage to Bancshares' and
CNL's officers and directors as such officers and directors had under
Bancshares' existing policy), or (ii) an extension of Bancshares' existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy. However, Valley shall
only be required to insure such persons upon terms and for coverages
substantially similar to Bancshares' existing officers' and directors'
liability insurance, and if such coverage over a six year period would in the
aggregate cost more than 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
Bancshares for such coverage, then Valley shall be required only to obtain
such coverage as may be obtained by an expenditure equal to 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by Bancshares for such coverage.

(e) Any Bancshares Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 5.13 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may have to
such Bancshares Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice
Valley.

5.14 Employment and Director Matters; Other Post-Closing Items.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule,
Valley and VNB hereby expressly agree to honor, effective from and after the
Effective Time, each of the agreements entered into by Bancshares' executives
on the date hereof and identified on the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule, in
accordance with their respective terms.

(b) Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide whether
to continue each of the Bancshares Pension Plans and/or the Bancshares Welfare
Plans for the benefit of employees of CNL and Bancshares, or to have such
employees become covered under a Valley pension and/or welfare plan in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Valley pension and/or welfare plans.
Subject to the foregoing, following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall
make available to all employees and officers of Bancshares who become employed
by VNB coverage under the benefit plans generally available to VNB's employees
and officers (including pension and health and hospitalization) on the terms
and conditions available to VNB's employees and officers in Valley or VNB
medical and dental plans for Bancshares employees and their dependents. No
prior existing condition limitation not currently imposed by Bancshares or CNL
medical or dental plans shall be imposed with respect to Valley's or VNB's
medical and dental plans on Bancshares or CNL employees. Bancshares and CNL
employees shall receive credit for any deductibles paid under Bancshares and
CNL existing medical and dental plans. Bancshares employees will be given
credit for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual
purposes) under Valley's or VNB's medical, life, vacation, sick leave,
disability and other welfare plans for prior service with Bancshares, and
Bancshares' employees will be granted credit for such prior service with
Bancshares, solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Valley's or
VNB's 401(k) plan. No Bancshares employee will be given credit for prior
service under Valley's or VNB's Pension Plan for any purpose.

(c) Valley will use reasonable efforts to retain Bancshares and CNL employees
following the Effective Time of the Merger.

(d) Except for Bancshares and CNL employees who have individual severance or
similar contractual agreement, following the consummation of the Merger and
for one year thereafter, VNB shall pay severance to Bancshares and CNL
employees who are involuntarily terminated by Valley or VNB for reasons other
than cause in accordance with the Bancshares severance plan set forth on the
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Within two weeks of the date of this Agreement, Valley, VNB, Bancshares
and CNL shall cooperate to develop, implement and communicate to key employees
of Bancshares and CNL identified as such by the Chief Executive Officer of
Bancshares together with the President and Chief Executive Officer of Valley,
a retention program, as described on the Bancshares Disclosure Schedule,
designed to retain the services of such key employees through the Effective
Time and thereafter until one hundred and eighty (180) days following the
Closing Date or such earlier or later time as Valley and VNB may determine
consistent with their respective business needs.

(f) Valley and VNB may, in their discretion within thirty (30) days prior to
the Effective Time, direct Bancshares and CNL to terminate any or all
nonqualified deferred compensation plans, programs and arrangements sponsored
by them in a manner that does not materially adversely affect the rights of
participants to benefits earned through the effective date of the change in
control of Bancshares. Upon receipt of such a direction Bancshares and CNL
shall take all requisite action to implement it.

(g) As of the date hereof, Valley has entered into stock option agreements
with each of the directors of Bancshares set forth on the Valley Disclosure
Schedule for the issuance of Valley Common Stock in the amounts and with the
terms and conditions as set forth on such schedule. In consideration
therefore, each such director has entered into a non-competition and non-
solicitation agreement in substantially the form set forth on the Valley
Disclosure Schedule.

(h) As of the date hereof, Valley has entered into employment agreements with
the individuals set forth on the Valley Disclosure Schedule.

5.15 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
income Tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of Bancshares and Valley
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will
not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither
Valley nor any affiliate knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) As of the date hereof, Bancshares does not know of any reason why it would
not be able to deliver to counsel to Valley certificates substantially in
compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or
customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to
enable counsel to Valley to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Section
6.1(d), and Bancshares hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as
of the date of such opinions to counsel to Valley.

(c) As of the date hereof, Valley does not know of any reason why it would not
be able to deliver to counsel to Valley certificates substantially in
compliance with the IRS Guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions
and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to Valley to deliver the legal
opinions contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and Valley hereby agrees to deliver
such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions to counsel to
Valley.

5.16 Bank Policies and Bank Mergers. Notwithstanding that Bancshares believes
that it has established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible
loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations,
Bancshares recognizes that Valley may have adopted different loan, accrual and
reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for
possible loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time and in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Bank
Merger, Bancshares and Valley shall consult and cooperate with each other with
respect to (i) conforming to the extent appropriate, based upon such
consultation, Bancshares' loan, accrual and reserve policies and Bancshares'
other policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters,
including without limitation FRB, Bank Secrecy Act and FDIC matters, to those
policies of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to Bancshares from time
to time, (ii) conforming, based upon such consultation, the composition of the
investment portfolio and overall asset/liability management position of
Bancshares and CNL to the extent appropriate, and (iii) developing a plan for
the conversion of Bancshares' systems and processes to those of Valley's so
that such conversion can be implemented as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time; provided that any required change in Bancshares' practices in
connection with the matters described above need not be effected (A) more than
five days prior to the Effective Time and (B) unless and until all necessary
regulatory, governmental and shareholder approvals and consents have been
received, all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired,
Valley agrees in writing that all conditions precedent to the Closing have
occurred (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing), and Valley has
provided the Closing Notice. No accrual or reserve made by Bancshares or any
Bancshares Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation or
regulatory proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation,
warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or to
constitute a termination event within the meaning of Section 7.1(e) or Section
7.1(f) hereof.

5.17 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of Bancshares Common Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of shares of Bancshares Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

5.18 Shareholder Litigation. Bancshares shall give Valley the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against Bancshares and/or its directors or other affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Valley's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Article VI. \- CLOSING CONDITIONS

6.1 Conditions of Each Party's Obligations Under this Agreement. The
respective obligations of each party under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, or, where permissible under
applicable law, waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:

(a) Approval of Shareholders; SEC Registration. This Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been duly adopted and approved by
the requisite vote of the shareholders of Bancshares. The Registration
Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC and shall not be
subject to a stop order or any threatened stop order.

(b) Regulatory Approvals. All regulatory or governmental approvals and
consents (including without limitation any required approval of the OCC and
any approval or waiver required by the FRB) required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals") shall
have been obtained. All conditions required to be satisfied prior to the
Effective Time by the terms of such approvals and consents shall have been
satisfied; and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired. Both VNB and CNL shall have taken all necessary action to consummate
the Bank Merger immediately after the Effective Time.

(c) Suits and Proceedings. No order shall be outstanding against a party or
its Subsidiaries or a third party that would have the effect of preventing
completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger; no suit, action or other
proceeding shall be pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity seeking
to restrain or prohibit the Merger or the Bank Merger; and no suit, action or
other proceeding shall be pending before any court or Governmental Entity
seeking to restrain or prohibit the Merger or the Bank Merger or obtain other
substantial monetary or other relief against one or more parties, VNB or CNL
in connection with this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement and which
Valley or Bancshares determines in good faith, based upon the advice of their
respective counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger or the
Bank Merger because any such suit, action or proceeding has a significant
potential to be resolved in such a way as to deprive the party electing not to
proceed of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger.

(d) Tax Opinions. Valley shall have received a written opinion from Day Pitney
LLP, counsel to Valley, and Bancshares shall have received a written opinion
from Hacker, Johnson and Smith, PA, each dated as of the Closing Date, based on

in each such opinion, to the effect that (i) the Merger will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) the
exchange of Bancshares Common Stock for Valley Common Stock will not give rise
to gain or loss to the shareholders of Bancshares with respect to such
exchange (except to the extent of any cash received), (iii) the aggregate tax
basis of the shares of Valley Common Stock received by each shareholder of
Bancshares Common Stock will equal the aggregate tax basis of such
shareholder's shares of Bancshares Common Stock (reduced by any amount
allocable to share interests for which cash is received) exchanged in the
Merger and the holding period for the shares of Valley Common Stock received
by each Bancshares shareholder will include the holding period for the shares
of Bancshares Common Stock exchanged in the Merger, and (iv) neither Valley
nor Bancshares will recognize gain or loss as a consequence of the Merger

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Bancshares:

(a) by mutual consent of Bancshares and Valley;

(b) by either Valley or Bancshares upon written notice to the other party if
the approval of any Governmental Entity required for consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is denied by
final, non-appealable action of such Governmental Entity; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, such
action;

(c) by either Valley or Bancshares, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Cutoff Date (or such later date as shall have
been agreed to in writing by Valley and Bancshares), provided, however, that
no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the
failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the Cutoff Date was due
to such party's material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein;

(d) by either Valley or Bancshares if the approval of the shareholders of
Bancshares required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(e) by either Valley or Bancshares (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a
representation or warranty, would, individually or in the aggregate with other
breaches, (i) result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the party
committing such breach, or (ii) result in one or more of the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 (in case of a termination by Valley) or 6.3 (in
case of termination by Bancshares) not to be satisfied or not capable of being
satisfied by the Cutoff Date;

(f) by either Valley or Bancshares (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other
party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant, would, individually or in the aggregate
with other breaches, (i) result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
the party committing such breach, or (ii) result in one or more of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 (in case of a termination by Valley)
or 6.3 (in case of termination by Bancshares) not to be satisfied or not
capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date;

(g) by the Board of Directors of Valley if, (I) prior to receipt of the
Bancshares Shareholder Approval, Bancshares or the Bancshares Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) has (A) effected a Bancshares Subsequent
Determination or approved, adopted, endorsed or recommended any Acquisition
Proposal, (B) failed to recommend the Merger and the approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of Bancshares or failed to publicly re-affirm
its recommendation of the Merger within five days after receipt from Valley of
a written request to do so, (C) breached the terms of Section 5.3 in any
material respect adverse to Valley, or (D) in response to the commencement
(other than by Valley or a Subsidiary thereof) of a tender offer or exchange
offer for 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Bancshares Common Stock,
recommended that the shareholders of Bancshares tender their shares in such
tender or exchange offer or otherwise failed to recommend that such
shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer promptly upon written
request of Valley, or (II) any other event occurs that gives rise to the
payment of a Termination Fee and Termination Expenses pursuant to Section 7.3
of this Agreement;

(h) By Bancshares if, prior to receiving Bancshares Shareholder Approval, (i)
Bancshares has received a Superior Proposal, and in accordance with Section
5.3 of this Agreement, has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect
to the Superior Proposal, or (ii) if Bancshares' Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with Bancshares' outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure of Bancshares' Board of Directors
to effect a Bancshares Subsequent Determination would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, but only if prior to terminating this
Agreement, Bancshares (A) pays to Valley the Termination Fee and Termination
Expenses and (B) delivers to Valley a release signed by the parties to such
acquisition agreement and any entity that controls such parties, which release
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Valley and shall
irrevocably waive any right the releasing parties may have to challenge the
payment to Valley of the Termination Fee and the payment to Valley of the
Termination Expenses;

(i) by Valley if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and
6.2 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff
Date; or

(j) by Bancshares if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff
Date. 

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Valley or Bancshares as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i) Sections 5.5(b), 5.9,
Articles VII and VIII and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that either of the parties
shall willfully default in its obligations hereunder, the non-defaulting party
may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and
shall be paid by the willfully defaulting party for all damages, costs and
expenses, including without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking
and printing expenses, incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in
connection herewith or in the enforcement of its rights hereunder.

7.3 Termination Fee; Expenses.

(a) In the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement Valley
shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or 7.1(f), then
Bancshares shall pay to Valley on the date of such termination, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Valley in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (as itemized by Valley), up to $750,000 (the "Termination
Expenses").

(b) In the event that:

(i)(A) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or intention to
make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have been made
directly to Bancshares' shareholders or otherwise publicly disclosed or
otherwise communicated or made known to senior management of Bancshares or
Bancshares Board of Directors and (B) this Agreement is thereafter terminated
(x) by Bancshares or Valley pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) (but
only if, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d), the
Registration Statement shall have been declared effective no later than sixty
(60) days prior to the Cutoff Date), or (y) by Valley pursuant to Section
7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f), then, (I) Bancshares shall pay to Valley,
immediately upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Termination Expenses, and, (II) if within 12 months after such
termination, Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any
Acquisition Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same Acquisition
Proposal that shall have been made, publicly disclosed or communicated prior
to termination hereof), then Bancshares shall pay Valley, on the earlier of
the date of such execution or consummation, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, a fee of $7.5 million (the "Termination Fee"); or

(ii)this Agreement is terminated by Valley pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or by
Bancshares pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then Bancshares shall pay Valley,
immediately upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses.

For purposes of Section 7.3(b)(i), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.3(e)(i) except that references in
Section 5.3(e)(i) to "25%" shall be replaced by "50%".

to the benefit of Valley, Bancshares, VNB and CNL and their respective
successors. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer, expressly or by
implication, upon any other person any rights or remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement, except for the rights conferred upon Bancshares Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 5.13 hereof.

8.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules hereto and the
other documents, agreements and instruments executed and delivered pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement, contain the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and supersede all prior negotiations, arrangements or understandings, written

will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

8.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any person other than Valley and Bancshares any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause, following the Effective Time (but
not unless and until the Effective Time occurs), the provisions of Section
5.13 shall be enforceable by each Bancshares Indemnitee described therein.

8.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of Bancshares or
Valley) or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the
application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force
and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto.

8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and each of which
shall be deemed an original.

8.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey or any New Jersey state court sitting in Passaic County, and each
of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocable waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.8
shall not constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of
New Jersey and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
Section 8.8. The parties hereto agree that final judgment in any suit, action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

8.9 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are for
