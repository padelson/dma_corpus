cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with (the _"Merger"_ ) and into the

1 AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

 

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement
but in no event more than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Annex I (the " _Offer
Conditions_ _"_ ), promptly after the later of (i) the earliest date as of
which Purchaser is permitted under applicable Legal Requirements to accept for
payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as
of which each of the Offer Conditions has been satisfied, or waived by Parent
or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept
for payment each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer and promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant
to the Offer pay the Offer Price net to the seller in cash, without interest,
for each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer. The obligation of Purchaser (and of Parent to cause Purchaser) to
accept for payment, and pay the Offer Price net to the seller in cash,
without interest, for, each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, of each of the Offer Conditions.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms and conditions of the Offer as set
forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I) and the
other conditions set forth in Annex I. Purchaser expressly reserves the right
(in its sole discretion) to (x) increase the Offer Price, (y) waive, in whole
or in part, any Offer Condition and (z) make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise
provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) decrease the maximum number
of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) impose conditions to the
Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or modify any of the
Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects any holder of Shares, (vi)
change or waive the Minimum Condition or (vii) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any
rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8\.

 



2 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is 20 business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the _"Initial
Expiration Date")_ or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the "
_Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

 

(1) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied (other than conditions which by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time), or waived by
Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, then Purchaser may in its sole
discretion (or if requested in writing by the Company prior to such scheduled
Expiration Date, Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for one or
more successive periods of 10 Business Days (or such other number of Business
Days as may be jointly determined by Purchaser and the Company) each in order
to permit the satisfaction of such conditions (subject to the right of
Purchaser to waive any condition (other than the Minimum Condition) in
accordance with this Agreement), provided such extension of the Offer period
does not extend past the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 and (y) the date, as applicable, that is (A) 90 days
after commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Outside Date"_ ), or (B) 120
days after commencement of the Offer (the " _Extended Outside Date_ ") (1) in
the event that the HSR Condition shall not have been satisfied, or waived by
Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, by the Initial Outside Date but
all of the other Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied (other than the
Minimum Condition and conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Offer Acceptance Time), or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder or (2) in the event that Purchaser is exercising in its sole
discretion its option to extend the Offer and the Regulatory Conditions shall
not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder, by the Initial Outside Date but all of the other Offer Conditions
shall have been satisfied (other than the Minimum Condition and conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time), or
waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder; and

(2) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required
by applicable Legal Requirements or interpretation or position of the SEC or
its staff applicable to the Offer. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1. Nothing in this Section 1.1 shall affect any of the termination
rights set forth in Section 8.1.

 

(f) If fewer than 90% of the number of outstanding Shares are accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer or acquired through the Offer and exercise of
the Top-Up Option, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for one
"subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Additionally, in the
event that more than 80% of the then outstanding Shares have been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer following the
Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), at
the written request of

 



3  the Company, provide for one "subsequent offering period" in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of at least 10 Business Days immediately
following the Expiration Date unless (i) Parent and Purchaser exercise the
Top-Up Option or (ii) Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries, in
the aggregate, own more than 90% of the outstanding Shares. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay the Offer Price
net to the seller in cash, without interest, for, each Share that is validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer during such
"subsequent offering period" promptly after any such Share is tendered during
such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for the
possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Section 1.1(f).

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any shares pursuant to
the Offer and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the _"Schedule TO"_ ) that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal (such Schedule TO and the documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with
any amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the
_"Offer Documents"_ ) and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of the Shares in accordance with Rule 14d-4 under the Exchange Act.
Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by
either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available
to Parent, Purchaser and ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel all information
concerning the Acquired Corporations and the CompanyÂ’s stockholders that may
be required in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(h),
including such information required by applicable Legal Requirements to be set
forth in the Offer Documents. The Company, its outside legal counsel and
the General Counsel of the Company shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company, its outside legal
counsel and the General Counsel of the Company with any oral or written
comments Parent, Purchaser or ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or
the Offer.

 



4 1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the requirements of the
DGCL, (iii) resolved to recommend that stockholders of the Company accept the
Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if necessary under
applicable Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
(such recommendation set forth in this subclause (iii), the _"Company Board
Recommendation"_ ). Subject to Section 1.2(b), the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents.

(b) (i) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall (A) (1) withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board
Recommendation or (2) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (A) being referred to as an  _"Adverse
Change Recommendation"_ ) or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow any Acquisition
Corporation to execute or enter into any Contract constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would be reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.3(a)).

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.2(b)(i),
at any time prior to accepting, for the first time, for payment and paying
for such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the _"Offer Acceptance Time"_
), the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation (A) in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that no Adverse Change
Recommendation may be made in response to such Intervening Event unless (1)
the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
make an Adverse Change Recommendation at least three Business Days prior
to making any Adverse Change Recommendation (a _"Change of Recommendation
Notice"_ ) describing such Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed
that any material change in the facts relating to such Intervening Event
shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice and a new three Business
Day period), (2) the Company shall have given Parent three Business Days after
ParentÂ’s receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to such proposed revisions or other proposal,
if any, the Board of

 



5  Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse
Change Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements or (B) in response to an Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation, is a Superior Offer if the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse
Change Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that no Adverse Change
Recommendation may be made in response to a Superior Offer unless (1) the
Company shall have given Parent a Change of Recommendation Notice at least
three Business Days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation,
including the terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and the identity of
the third party making such Superior Offer and attaching a copy of the most
current draft of any written agreement relating to such Superior Offer (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or
condition of such Superior Offer shall require a new Change of Recommendation
Notice and a new three Business Day period), (2) the Company shall have given
Parent three Business Days after ParentÂ’s receipt of the Change of
Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of internationally recognized
reputation, that such Superior Offer continues to meet the definition of
"Superior Offer" and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make the Adverse Change Recommendation would reasonably constitute
a breach of the fiduciary duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. 

(c) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with
the SEC and disseminate to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the _"Schedule 14D-9"_ ) that,
subject to Section 1.2(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and its outside legal
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its outside legal counsel with
any oral or written comments the Company or its outside legal counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of such comments. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. 

 



6 (d) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of
its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of the Shares and
lists of securities positions of the Shares held in stock depositories, in
each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to
deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries
from such information then in their possession or control. In addition, in
connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and Purchaser to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to
any Employee Plan and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the
Offer.

1.3 Directors.

(a) Upon the Offer Acceptance Time and at all times thereafter, subject to
compliance with the Company Charter Documents, applicable Legal Requirements
and the applicable Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ, Purchaser shall be
entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to
the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of
the Company (after giving effect to the directors elected or designated by
Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that
the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any
of their Affiliates (including Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. The Company
shall, upon PurchaserÂ’s request at any time following the purchase of and
payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, promptly take all such actions
necessary to (i) elect or designate to the Board of Directors of the Company
the individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by
the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including promptly filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of the
Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the
Company (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, in each
case as is necessary or desirable to enable PurchaserÂ’s designees to be so
elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company and (ii) cause
PurchaserÂ’s designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The
Company shall, upon PurchaserÂ’s request following the Offer Acceptance Time,
also cause Persons designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the
Company of (i)

 



7  each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) the board of
directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and applicable NASDAQ Marketplace
Rules. From and after the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined
by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(1) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. The CompanyÂ’s obligations under this
Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of
this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a),
including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the
information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
PurchaserÂ’s designees to be elected or designated to the Board of Directors
of the Company. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with
respect to PurchaserÂ’s designees and ParentÂ’s and PurchaserÂ’s respective
officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner
of Shares as a matter of applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

 

(b) In the event that PurchaserÂ’s designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company
to maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Board of Directors of
the Company on or prior to the date hereof and who are not officers,
directors or employees of Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, each
of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the CompanyÂ’s audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and at least
one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Items
407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K (the " _Continuing Directors_ _"_ )
_; provided, however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due
to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person
(or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to fill such vacancies and
such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
PurchaserÂ’s designees constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company after the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in
addition to the approval rights of the Board of Directors of the Company or
the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Company Charter
Documents or applicable Legal Requirements) be required (i) for the Company to
amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
CompanyÂ’s rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would
adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company
Charter Documents if such action would adversely affect, or would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser) or (iv) to take

 



8  any other action of the Board of Directors of the Company under or in
connection with this Agreement if such action would adversely affect the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser). The Continuing Directors
shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the
authority to retain such outside legal counsel (which may include current
outside legal counsel to the Company or the Board of Directors of
the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement.

 

1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the _"Top-Up Option"_ ) to purchase from the Company the number of newly-
issued Shares (such newly-issued shares, the _"Top-Up Option Shares"_ ) equal
to up to the lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number
of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that
would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to
the Top-Up Option on a fully diluted basis (determined in accordance with
Annex I) or (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is
authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not
issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to
be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after the Offer Acceptance Time, in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to deliver
Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the
conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (i) immediately following the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned in the aggregate by
Parent and Purchaser constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the
number of Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of
all Shares subject to the Top-Up Option on a fully diluted basis (determined
in accordance with Annex I) and (ii) the Minimum Condition shall have been
satisfied. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Legal
Requirements, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act.

 

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note (with full recourse to Parent) having a principal
amount equal to such purchase price or (iii) any combination thereof. Any such
promissory note shall bear simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty; provided,
however, upon any Event of Default, all principal and accrued interest
thereunder shall immediately become due and payable.

 



9 (d) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Parent or Purchaser intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Purchaser intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place
and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares is
to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Parent or
Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate or certificates representing the
Top-Up Option Shares or, at ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s request or otherwise if
the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (the  _"Book-Entry Shares"_
). Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will
be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor,"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be acquired
by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

 

Section 2\. MERGER TRANSACTION

 

2.1 Merger of Purchaser into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the Merger,
whereby Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Purchaser shall cease. The Company will continue as the
Surviving Corporation.

2.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

2.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the _"Closing"_
) shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide
Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10019, at 10:00 a.m. local time on a
date to be designated by Parent (the _"Closing Date"_ ), which shall be no
later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last
to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company
and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing,
delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing. The
Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the parties and
specified in the certificate of merger (the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective, the _"Effective Time"_ ).

 



10 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to conform to
Exhibit B;

 

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are designated as
directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

(i) any Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the CompanyÂ’s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Novartis shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Section
2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 2.6(e);
and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



11 2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the _"Paying
Agent"_ ) for the holders of the Shares to receive the funds to which holders
of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
shares (the _"Certificates"_ ) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. 

(c) At any time following the 180th day after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Shares to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to three years following the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would
otherwise be required to be delivered to a 

 



12  public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares or Company Equity
Awards such amounts as may be required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and
withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may
be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Equity Awards in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration without any interest thereon
(less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section
2.6(e)).

2.7 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such
Shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the _"Dissenting Shares"_ ) shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but rather shall entitle such
holder to payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Legal Requirements), unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right
to appraisal, each such Share shall be treated as if it had been converted as
of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration without
any interest thereon (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 2.6(e)). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent shall not, except with the prior
written

 



13  consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time. If any appraisal is made of Dissenting
Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the Effective Time, then
for purposes of the appraisal, the cash received and/or value of the
promissory note received by the Company in payment of the exercise price of
the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if it were not paid to or received by
the Company and the Shares issued upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option shall
be treated as if they were not issued or outstanding.

 

2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 3\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Restricted Share or Restricted Stock Unit is entitled, at the Effective Time
to any treatment of such Company Option, Restricted Share or Restricted Stock

exercise price of each Company Option is not less than the fair market value
of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such Company Option. Each
grant of Company Equity Awards was recorded on the CompanyÂ’s financial
statements (including any related notes thereto) for any period ending on or
after the date of such grant and contained in the Company SEC Documents.

Subsidiaries or any part thereof; or (iii) outstanding security, instrument or
obligation that is or may become convertible into or exchangeable for any

(a) Since January 1, 2008, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) with the
SEC (the _"Company SEC Documents"_ ). As of their respective dates, the
Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or SOX, as the case may be, and none
of the Company SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared from, and in accordance with, the
books and records of the Acquired Corporations; (iii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (
_"GAAP"_ _)_ applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered
(except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in
the case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form
8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act, and except that the
unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments); and (iv) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Acquired
Corporations as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Corporations for the periods
covered thereby. No financial statements of any Person other than the
Acquired Corporations are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

 



17 (c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2009 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Acquired Corporations;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Acquired Corporations
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The CompanyÂ’s
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the
CompanyÂ’s independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently
withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009. Each of the principal executive officer (as defined under SOX) of
the Company and the principal financial officer (as defined under SOX) of the
Company (or each former principal executive officer of the Company and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made
all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. Since
January 1, 2008, none of the Acquired Corporations, any officer of the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, the
CompanyÂ’s independent registered accountant, has identified or been made
aware of: (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness (each as defined
Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by any of the Acquired
Corporations; (ii) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the CompanyÂ’s management or other employees; or (iii) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing. None of the Acquired Corporations
has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the
CompanyÂ’s reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the principal
executive officer of

 



18  the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market.

(e) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to or has any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to any joint venture, securitization

any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Acquired Corporations, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired Corporation in
any Acquired CorporationÂ’s published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

 

(f) There have been no written inquiries, interrogatories or comments with
respect to any of the Company SEC Documents from the SEC, NASDAQ or any other
Governmental Body received since January 1, 2008, and the Company has no
knowledge of any such inquiries, interrogatories or comments that were oral.

Corporations to conduct their business as currently conducted, in each case
free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

adjournment or postponement thereof), contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. For clarity, the
representations and warranties in this Section 4.5 will not apply to
statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or Proxy Statement based upon information
supplied to Parent by the Acquired Corporations or any of their
Representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference

4.7 Legal Proceedings; Orders. (a) There is no Legal Proceeding pending and
served (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened or pending and not served)
against Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective properties or assets,
other than Legal Proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and (b) there is no order, decision, determination, decree (including
consent decrees), stipulation, award, verdict, settlement agreement or similar
agreement, ruling, writ, injunction or judgment to which Parent or Purchaser
or any of their respective properties or assets are subject, other than such
orders, decisions, determinations, decrees, stipulations, awards, verdicts,
agreements, rulings, writs, injunctions and judgments that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.8 Funds. Parent has availability under its credit facilities, and the
unrestricted right to borrow in accordance with the terms of such credit
facilities, as of the date of this Agreement in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Offer and the Merger. Parent or Purchaser will have available

exclusive representations and warranties made by the Company in connection
with the Transactions and (b) all other representations and warranties with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind or nature
whether express, implied or statutory are specifically disclaimed by the

5.3 No Solicitation.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not directly or
indirectly, and shall not authorize or permit any other Acquired Corporation
or any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations to directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (including by granting
any waiver under Section 203 of the DGCL), (ii) furnish any information
regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in connection with

from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Acquired Corporations to,
or entering into discussions with, any Person in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person
(and not withdrawn) if (A) none of the Company, any other Acquired
Corporation or any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall
have breached or taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set
forth in this Section 5.3, (B) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside

 



41  legal counsel and a financial advisor of internationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected
to result in a Superior Offer and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably constitute a
breach of fiduciary duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, (C) at least two
Business Days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and of the CompanyÂ’s intention
to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such
Person, and the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement in a customary form that is no less favorable to the Company than
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (D) the Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent prior to or concurrent with the time such nonpublic
information is furnished to such Person (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished or made available by the
Company to Parent). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence
by any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation
shall be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.3(a) shall prohibit the Company
or the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer
by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall the foregoing affect the obligations of the Company
specified in Section 1.2(b) (it being understood that any "stop, look and
listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered an Adverse Change Recommendation).

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest
that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information relating to any of the Acquired Corporations (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the terms and conditions
thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing
Period. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to
the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or request (including any modification or proposed modification
thereto) and any discussions or negotiations concerning the terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent promptly (and in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof) copies of all correspondence
and other written material (including draft agreements) relating to any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request exchanged
between the Acquired Corporations (or their Representatives), on the one
hand, and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or request (or its Representatives), on the other hand, other than
correspondence or other written material that does not relate to any material
term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or request.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause the other
Acquired Corporations and any Representative of an Acquired Corporation to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information relating to any of the Acquired
Corporations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
indication of interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



42 (d) The Company agrees, except in the case that the CompanyÂ’s Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, to not
release or permit the release during the Pre-Closing Period of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired Corporations is a party; provided, however, that if the Company
waives any "standstill" or similar provision with respect to any Person, then
the terms of any "standstill" or similar provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be waived. The Company shall promptly request each Person that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
PersonÂ’s consideration of acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock
or assets or otherwise) any Acquired Corporation to return (or if permitted by
the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to
be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of
the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if requested by Parent, to
enforce such PersonÂ’s obligation to do so. The Company shall also immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to
any such Person or its Representatives.

5.4 Certain Tax Matters.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
other Acquired Corporation to, (i) timely file all material Tax Returns
(taking into account any applicable extensions) required to be filed by or on
behalf of each such Entity on or before the Closing Date, (ii) timely pay all
material due and payable Taxes of each such Entity, (iii) accrue a reserve in
the books and records and financial statements of any such Entity consistent
with past practices for all material Taxes payable but not yet due, (iv)
promptly notify Parent of any Legal Proceeding pending against or with
respect to any Acquired Corporation in respect of any material amount of Tax,
(v) not consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any material Tax claim or assessment that could adversely affect ParentÂ’s
Tax liability and (vi) not settle or compromise any material Tax liability
without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Any Tax Returns described in this Section 5.4 shall be
accurate and complete in all material respects and shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practices. The Company shall make such Tax Returns
available to Parent.

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and each other Acquired
Corporation shall retain all books, documents and records reasonably
necessary for the preparation of Tax Returns.

commenced on July 1, 2010 and January 3, 2011, respectively, no additional
offering shall be authorized or commenced, (ii) participation shall be
limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement
and (iii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP as
an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, such participants may not
increase the rate of their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date
of this Agreement. The rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any
offering periods then underway under the ESPP shall be determined by treating
the last Business Day of the last payroll period prior to the Effective Time
or, if later, the tenth Business Day prior to the Effective Time (such latest
date, the " _Purchase Date_ ") as the last day of all such offering periods
and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary

 



46  to reflect the shortened offering periods but otherwise treating each such
shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period
for all purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall cause all outstanding
Purchase Rights (as defined in the ESPP) to be exercised on the Purchase Date
and all offerings to terminate immediately after such exercise. The ESPP shall
terminate immediately following such shortened offering period. Prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.3(b).

 

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.3(a) shall be subject to any
required withholding and shall be paid without interest as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to each employee of the Acquired Corporations who
continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any
Subsidiary thereof) (the _"Continuing Employees"_ ) total compensation
(including employee benefits other than (A) equity-based compensation or
benefits and (B) change of control, retention and other special or non-
recurring compensation or benefits, and based on bonus opportunity rather
than actual bonus payments) that is at least substantially comparable in the
aggregate to such compensation provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement; provided, however,
that Parent shall be permitted to (1) change or modify benefit levels prior
to such date if necessary or reasonably advisable in connection with changes
in applicable Legal Requirements and (2) take any and all actions that may be
necessary to migrate Continuing Employees to the employee benefit plans,
policies and arrangements of Parent or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
foregoing:

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to assume the liability for such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice
and policies of the applicable Acquired Corporation.

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that
they are eligible to participate in comparable Employee Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that (i) nothing in this
Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit plan or any other plan, program, policy or arrangement at any time and
(ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or
welfare benefit plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition
period), the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in ParentÂ’s
health and welfare benefit plans, to substantially the same extent
as similarly situated employees of Parent, to the extent the Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate in comparable plans of the Surviving
Corporation immediately prior to such termination. To the extent that service
is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off)
under any health or

 



47  welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation that is made
available to Continuing Employees, then Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall,
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and allowances (including paid time off)
but not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees for
service prior to the Effective Time with the Acquired Corporations to the
same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under
the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company; provided,
however, that in each case, such credit shall not result in the duplication of
benefits. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.
Without limiting the scope of Section 9.7, the provisions of this Section 6.4
are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no employee
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any
employee benefit plan or trustee thereof shall be regarded for any purpose as
a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement for any purpose.

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
all rights to indemnification by the Company and its Subsidiaries existing in
favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (the
_"Indemnified Persons"_ ) for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements (as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement) between the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the Indemnified Persons, on the other hand, in the forms
made available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms; _provided_ that any claim made requesting
indemnification pursuant to such indemnification rights prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall continue to be subject to this Section
6.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided under this Section 6.5(a) until
disposition of such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of which has been delivered or made
available to Parent) (the _"Existing D andO Policy"_) or provide substitute
policies, in each case, on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and
amounts no less favorable than the existing policy, or prior to the Effective
Time purchase a six-year "tail policy" for the existing policy; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium paid by the Company on
November 4, 2010 under the Existing DandO Policy (which annual premium is hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be $294,549), it being understood
that if the annual premium payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
200% amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost equal to such 200% amount.

 



48 (c) In the event the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or
at ParentÂ’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.5.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. This
Section 6.5 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer
Acceptance Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Person.

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions. In no
event shall the Company enter into or agree to any settlement with respect to
such securityholder litigation without ParentÂ’s prior written consent.

 

6.7 Additional Agreements. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions as promptly
as practicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party
to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required, proper or advisable to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and each
of the other Transactions and (iii) shall use all reasonable efforts to
lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger.
The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made,
each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during
the Pre-Closing Period.

6.8 Disclosure. Each of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall cause
its Affiliates and Representatives to) (a) provide reasonable prior notice of
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other Transactions to and (b) consult in good faith in order
to reach agreement as to the form, timing and contents of any such press
release or public announcement with (i) the Company, in the event the
disclosing party is Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliate or Representative
thereof, or (ii) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is any of the
Acquired Corporations or any Affiliate or Representative thereof, except as
required by applicable Legal Requirements or the rules or regulations of any
applicable stock exchange. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, (A) the

 



49  Company need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release,
public statement or filing to be issued or made with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, Superior Offer or Adverse Change Recommendation and (B)
this Section 6.8 shall terminate upon an Adverse Change Recommendation.

 

6.9 Resignation of Directors. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent
on or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time the resignation of the CompanyÂ’s
directors as required by Section 1.3.

6.10 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Transactions, each of Parent, the Company and the Board of Directors of
the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the
effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and
will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any
developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence
or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it,
(ii) would cause or constitute a breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations contained herein or (iii) is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 7 or in Annex I not
being able to be satisfied prior to the Outside Date.

6.11 Section 16 Matters. __ The CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer
Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the disposition of the Shares in the Offer and the deemed disposition
and cancellation of the Shares and Company Equity Awards in the Merger by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7\. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER

The obligations of the parties to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

7.1 Stockholder Approval. If required by applicable Legal Requirements, this
Agreement shall have been duly adopted by the Required Company Stockholder
Vote.

7.2 No Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree or ruling shall have been issued by any
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and remain in effect, and there
shall not be any Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger,
that has the effect of making illegal, prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Merger.

 



50 7.3 Consummation of Offer. Purchaser (or Parent on PurchaserÂ’s behalf) shall
have accepted for payment and paid for all of the Shares validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer (including pursuant to any "subsequent offer period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, if any) and not withdrawn. 

Section 8\. TERMINATION

 

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time
(whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Company Stockholder Vote):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall have expired without
the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if such partyÂ’s breach of this Agreement has
been the primary cause of or primarily resulted in the failure of the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and such party has not
cured such failure within ten days (or, in the case of a breach of Section
1.2(b) or 5.3, five days) after having received notice thereof;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable injunction, order,
decree or ruling, or any Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the
Offer or the Merger shall exist, having the effect of making illegal or
permanently prohibiting or otherwise preventing consummation of the Offer or
the Merger;

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer if (i) whether or not permitted to do so, the CompanyÂ’s
Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse Change Recommendation, or

CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors fails publicly to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten days of receipt of a written request by Parent to
provide such reaffirmation following an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) the

Acquisition Proposal, including a Superior Offer entered into in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement;

(e) by the Company if Purchaser (i) shall not have commenced (within the

tenth business day after the public announcement of the execution of this
Agreement or (ii) shall have terminated the Offer without having accepted any
Shares for payment thereunder (other than in accordance with this Agreement);
_provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if such failure or termination (A)
is curable by Parent and Parent is continuing to exercise its reasonable best
efforts to cure such failure or termination, unless such failure or
termination shall remain uncured for a period of five days commencing on the
date that the Company gives Parent notice of such failure or termination or
(B) is attributable

 



51  to a failure on the part of the Company to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by the Company at or
prior to the tenth business day after the public announcement of the
execution of this Agreement or the date of termination of the Offer, as
applicable;

(f) by either Parent or the Company if the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer shall not have occurred on or prior to the close of
business on the date that is the Outside Date;  _provided, however,_ that a
party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(f) if such partyÂ’s breach of this Agreement has been the primary

days) after having received notice thereof;

 

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter into the
Specified Agreement relating to such Superior Offer, if (i) such Superior
Offer shall not have resulted from any breach of Section 5.3, (ii) the Company

after satisfying all of the requirements set forth in Section 1.2(b), shall
have authorized the Company to enter into a binding written definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
constituting a Superior Offer (the _"Specified Agreement"_ );

(h) by Parent if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
the Company shall have occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions
in (2)(a), (b), (c) or (d) of Annex I to exist; _provided, however_ , that,
for purposes of this Section 8.1(h), if such a breach is curable by the
Company within 30 days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach and the Company is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts
to cure such breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(h) on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain
uncured for a period of 30 days (or, in the case of a breach of or failure to
perform with respect to Section 1.2(b) or 5.3, five days) commencing on the
date that Parent gives the Company notice of such breach; or 

(i) by the Company if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
Parent shall have occurred that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
_provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this Section 8.1(i), if such a
breach is curable by Parent within 30 days of the date the Company gives
Parent notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to exercise its
reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(i) on account of such breach
unless such breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days (or, in the
case of a breach of or failure to perform with respect to Section 1.2(b) or
5.3, five days) commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent notice
of such breach.

 



52 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect; _provided, however,_ that (a) Section 3.25, this Section 8.2, Section

remain in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and (c) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party from any liability for (i) any breach of any
covenant or obligation contained herein, (ii) any intentional breach of any
representation or warranty contained herein or (iii) any breach of
any representation or warranty contained herein such that the conditions in
(2)(a) or (b) of Annex I could not be satisfied, in each case prior to the
date of termination.

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 8.3(b), all fees and expenses incurred in

Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next sentence a nonrefundable fee
in the amount equal to $16,500,000 (the  _"Termination Fee"_ ). Any
Termination Fee that is payable shall be paid as follows: (x) in the case of

Section 9\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Sections 1.3 and
6.5(d), this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the Company and
Parent at any time (whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders); _provided, however_ , that after any such
adoption of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, no amendment shall
be made which by applicable Legal Requirements requires further approval of
the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



53 9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given.

 

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or schedule
or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Merger. This Section 9.3 shall not limit Section 8.2 or any covenant or
obligation of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after
the Effective Time.

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof; _provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement
may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or PDF shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Specific Performance; Remedies.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions: (i) each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and
federal courts located in the State of Delaware; (ii) if any such action is
commenced in a state court, then, subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
no party shall object to the removal of such action to any federal court
located in Delaware; (iii) each of the parties agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware; and (iv)

certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.8.

 



54 (b) Each of the parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any action between any of the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions. Each of the parties (i)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that
it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in
this Section 9.5(b).

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached or the Offer were revoked,
withdrawn, amended, modified or supplemented prior to the Expiration Date
other than in accordance with this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, to prevent revocation, withdrawal, modification or
supplementation of the Offer prior to the Expiration Date other than in
accordance with this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Offer, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations
without such consent shall be void and of no effect;  _provided_ , _further_
, that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and
obligations hereunder to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Novartis. No
assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of any other party
hereto.

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.5, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

9.8 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while service as a
director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneyÂ’s fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b)
hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only is such proceeding (or part thereof) authorized
by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be
a contract right and shall include the

 



B-2   right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that,
if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment
of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or
otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same
scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

(b) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under paragraph (a) of this
Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a
written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall
be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a
claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has
been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal
counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. 

(c) _Non-exclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this section shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision or the Certificate of Incorporation, By-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

(d) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance at its expense to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.
