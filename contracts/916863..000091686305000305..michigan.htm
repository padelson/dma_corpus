 3.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the " _Purchase Price_ ") will be an amount equal to $269,500,000.00 (the " _Base Price_ "), adjusted as follows: (i) the Base Price will be increased by the Adjustment Amount if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number; and (ii) the Base Price will be reduced by the Adjustment Amount if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number. **** The Adjustment Amount will be determined in accordance with the requirements set forth on _Exhibit 3.1_.

 

 3.2 _Determination of Purchase Price_.

 

>

 3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Obligations will be allocated among the Purchased Assets on a basis consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within 60 days following the final determination of the Purchase Price, the Parties will work together in good faith to agree upon such allocation; provided that in the event that such agreement has not been reached within such 60-day period, the allocation will be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm based solely on presentations of Buyer and Seller (and not independent review), and such determination will be binding on the Parties. Each Party will pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with such determination. Each Party will report the transactions contemplated by the Agreement for federal Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such allocation, and shall not voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation or otherwise with respect to such Tax Returns. Each Party will provide the other promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594 under the Code. Each Party will notify the other, and will provide the other with reasonably requested cooperation, in the event of an examination, audit, or other proceeding regarding the allocations provided for in this Section 3.3.

to such similarly situated  employees, or to be covered by Buyer-sponsored
benefit plans that  provide benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate,

cause the waiver of all limitations as to  pre-existing conditions and

Employees (except and then only to the  extent that a Transferred Employee
was subject to and had not, as of the  Closing Date, satisfied any such
condition, exclusion, or waiting period  under the Benefit Plans). With
respect to the calendar year in which the  Closing Date occurs, all health
care expenses incurred by any such  employees or any eligible dependent
thereof, including any alternate  recipient pursuant to qualified medical
child support orders, in the  portion of the calendar year preceding the
Closing Date that were  qualified to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying any  deductible or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller health
care plans  will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any
deductible or  out-of-pocket limit under the health care plan of Buyer for
such  calendar year. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 
days after the Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with all relevant 
information necessary or reasonably requested by Buyer for purposes of 
administering this provision.

service and seniority of each of the Transferred Employees  recognized by

applicable  Seller plans (the " _Grandfathered Active Employees_ "  and,
together with the Current Retirees, the " _Grandfathered  Individuals_ ") and
their spouses and eligible dependents. The  Grandfathered Individuals as of
the date hereof are listed on _Schedule  7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_. Effective on the
Closing Date and for a period  continuing at least through the last day of
the calendar year that  follows the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs (the " _Benefit  Continuation Period_ "), Buyer will provide to the
Current  Retirees Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that are comparable in
the  aggregate to those Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits provided to such 
Current Retirees immediately prior to the Closing Date, at a premium  rate
that is at least as favorable as the premium rate in effect for  and
available to the Current Retirees immediately prior to the Closing  Date
(subject to cost increases in accordance with Seller\'s past  practice),
provided that Buyer will provide a premium reduction credit  to each Current
Retiree (and surviving spouse of any Current Retiree)  equal to the premium
reduction credit accrued by such Current Retiree  as of the Closing Date
under the Seller\'s Post-Retirement Welfare  Benefit plans, if any. Buyer
will provide to the Grandfathered Active  Employees, for a period commencing
at the time such Grandfathered  Active Employee retires and continuing at
least through the last day  of the Benefit Continuation Period, Post-
Retirement Welfare Benefits  that are comparable in the aggregate to those
Post-Retirement Welfare  Benefits that would have been available to such
Grandfathered Active  Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (if
such employees had  retired immediately prior to the Closing Date), at a
premium rate that  is at least as favorable as the premium rate in effect for
and  available to the Grandfathered Active Employees immediately prior to 
the Closing Date (subject to cost increases in accordance with  Seller\'s
past practice); provided that Buyer will provide a premium  reduction credit
to each Grandfathered Active Employee (and surviving  spouse) equal to the
premium reduction credit accrued by such  Grandfathered Active Employee as of
the Closing Date under the  Seller\'s Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits plans,
if any. For the  avoidance of doubt, any Grandfathered Active Employee who
earns 1,000  hours of service with Seller in the calendar year in which the
Closing  occurs will be given credit for a year of service for the calendar 
year during which the Closing occurs for purposes of Seller\'s  Post-
Retirement Welfare Benefits. Following the Benefit Continuation  Period,
Buyer may exercise any rights that Seller would have had to  modify the post-
retirement health and life insurance plans applicable  to Grandfathered
Individuals, all other Transferred Employees, and the  spouses and eligible
dependents of all the above; provided that (i)  Buyer will not eliminate
Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for a period  of five years from the Closing
Date, (ii) Buyer will honor any premium  reduction credit in full for any
Grandfathered Individual, and (iii)  the Current Retirees, Grandfathered
Individuals, or other Transferred  Employees, or their spouses and eligible
dependents, shall not, as the  result of any such modification, be treated
less favorably than are  treated similarly situated non-union retirees of
Buyer (and the

trusts meeting the requirements of section  501(c)(9) of the Code (the "
_Buyer\'s VEBA_ ") and will  provide Seller with a copy of the exemption
letter or letters issued  by the Internal Revenue Service with respect
thereto. Following the  Closing, in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(2),  Seller will cause the trusts set forth on
_Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(2)_   (" _Seller\'s VEBAs_ ") to transfer cash to the
Buyer\'s  VEBA equal to the Allocated VEBA Amount, plus interest on the 
Allocated VEBA Amount from the Closing Date to the transfer date,  calculated
at the Prime Rate. The " _Allocated VEBA Amount_ "  means the amount of
assets in Seller\'s VEBAs that are allocated by  Seller as of the Closing
Date, in accordance with Seller\'s normal  policies and past practice, to
provide funding in part of the  Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for the
Grandfathered Individuals and  their spouses and eligible dependents. The
Allocated VEBA Amount as of  June 30, 2005 was $5,576,489.00. The Allocated
VEBA Amount will be  dedicated by Buyer for the funding in part of Post-
Retirement Welfare  Benefits for the Grandfathered Individuals and their
spouses and  eligible dependents. The Allocated VEBA Amount will be
transferred to  Buyer\'s VEBA as soon as administratively practicable after
the  Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller will make contributions to and 
distributions from Seller\'s VEBAs from time to time in accordance with 
Seller\'s normal policies and past practice determined by Seller in the 
exercise of its reasonable discretion.

>>> (E) With respect to the Aquila, Inc. Retirement  Investment Plan (the "
_Savings Plan_ "), Seller will vest  Transferred Employees in their Savings
Plan account balances as of the  Closing Date. Buyer will take all actions
necessary to cause a Buyer  401(k) plan in which Transferred Employees are
eligible to participate  (x) to recognize the service that the Transferred
Employees had in the  Savings Plan for purposes of determining such
Transferred Employees\'  eligibility to participate, vesting, attainment of
retirement dates,  contribution levels, and, if applicable, eligibility for
optional forms  of benefit payments, and (y) to accept direct rollovers (in
accordance  with section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of Transferred Employees\'
account  balances in the Savings Plan, such direct rollovers to be in cash
with  the exception that the direct rollovers may include transfers of loan 
balances and related promissory notes, provided that such loans would  not be
treated as taxable distributions at any time prior to such  transfer. Buyer
is not, in accepting direct rollovers of Transferred  Employees\' account
balances, assuming sponsorship of any portion of  Seller\'s Savings Plan or
any other liability or obligation that Seller  or an ERISA Affiliate of
Seller might have or incur with respect to the  Savings Plan, including
liability (if any) for breaches of fiduciary  duty or excise Tax amounts.

Buyer any balances standing to the credit of  Transferred Employees under
Seller\'s flexible spending plan as of the  day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. Following the Closing Date  and for the remainder of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date  occurs, the Transferred Employees
will continue to make salary reduction  contributions to Buyer\'s flexible
spending plan in accordance with such  Transferred Employees\' elections
under Seller\'s flexible spending plan.  Buyer will establish for each
Transferred Employee who participated in  Seller\'s flexible spending plan on
the Closing Date a book-keeping  account with a balance (positive or
negative, as applicable) equal to  the Transferred Employee\'s balance under
Seller\'s flexible spending plan  on the Closing Date. Seller also will
transfer to Buyer, within 10  Business Days following the Closing, an amount
of cash equal to the  aggregate unused balances of the book-keeping accounts
of the  Transferred Employees on the Closing Date. As soon as practicable but
in  no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller will provide 
to Buyer a list of those Transferred Employees that have participated in  the
health or dependent care reimbursement accounts of Seller, together  with (x)
their elections made prior to the Closing Date with respect to  such account
and (y) balances standing to their credit as of the day  immediately

cause) prior to the date which is one year  following the Closing Date,
severance benefits comparable to those  provided by Seller under Seller\'s
severance plans and policies (other  than any plans or policies with respect
to stock options) in effect  immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any
employee who is provided  severance benefits under this Section 7.9(d)(iii)
may be required to  execute a release of claims against Seller and Buyer, in
such form as  Buyer reasonably prescribes, as a condition for the receipt of
such  benefits.

workers\' compensation or other employment  benefits to which they are
entitled under applicable Law or under the  terms of the applicable

the Closing Date are not actively at work due to a  leave of absence covered
by the Family and Medical Leave Act or other  authorized leave of absence,
including short-term or long-term  disability or workers\' compensation
leave, will be treated as  Transferred Employees on the date that they are
able to return to work  (provided that such return to work occurs within the
authorized period  of their leaves following the Closing Date) and perform
the essential  functions of their jobs with or without reasonable

 7.11 _Transitional Use of Signage and Other Materials Incorporating Seller\'s Name or other Logos_. Buyer acknowledges that it will have no ongoing claim or rights in or to the Seller Marks. Buyer will not use or permit the use of any Seller Marks, and within 180 days following the Closing Date, Buyer will remove or cause the removal of the Seller Marks from all signage or other items relating to or used in the Business or the Purchased Assets.

 

 7.12 _Litigation and Regulatory Support_. In the event and for so long as either Party is actively contesting or defending against any Claim in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving Seller, the other Party will cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as is reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article IX hereof). In addition, in the event that Buyer is involved in any proceeding before the PSC or the FERC relating to any obligations (including payment obligations) for which Seller could be liable or responsible under this Agreement, Buyer agrees to consult with Seller concerning such obligations (including the positions taken with respect thereto), to allow Seller to participate in the proceeding to the extent necessary to protect or defend Seller\'s interests, and to allow Seller, at Seller\'s cost but if necessary in Buyer\'s name, to exhaust any appeals available to challenge any appealable decision that is adverse to Seller\'s interests in respect of such obligation. The Parties expressly agree that the types of proceedings to which the obligations in the foregoing sentence relate include purchased gas adjustment or gas cost

recovery proceedings as well as any other proceedings involving rates charged
to customers of the Business. Buyer agrees not to take any position in any
administrative or regulatory proceeding that is contrary to Seller\'s
interests and that relates to the operation of the Business (or the conduct
of any Central or Shared Function) prior to the Effective Time.

 

 7.13 _Notification of Customers_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Seller and Buyer will cause to be sent to customers of the Business a notice of the transfer of the customers from Seller to Buyer (the " _Customer Notification_ "). The Customer Notification will contain such information as is required by Law and approved by Buyer and Seller, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 7.14 _Document Delivery_. The Parties will work cooperatively to make available to Buyer at a reasonable date prior to the Closing such Documents as are reasonably necessary for Buyer and Seller, at the Effective Time, to effect the transition of control of the Business and a transfer of operation of the Business to Buyer with minimal interruptions or disruptions in the conduct of the Business. At or within a reasonably practicable period of time after the Closing Date, Buyer shall receive from Seller, at such location mutually agreed upon by the Parties, any remaining Documents. At Buyer\'s reasonable request, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available in an electronic format compatible with Buyer\'s electronic systems any Documents and other books and records relating to the Purchased Assets which are maintained by Seller in electronic form.

 

 7.15 _Title Insurance, Surveys, Estoppel Certificates, and Non-Disturbance Agreements_. At Buyer\'s option and at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, Buyer may obtain (i) title insurance policies in respect of the Real Property, insuring title to the applicable Real Property as vested in Buyer (free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances), and in form, substance, and amount reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with all requirements satisfied or waived, with all exceptions deleted, and with all endorsements thereto, to the extent reasonably desired by Buyer); (ii) all surveys desired by Buyer in respect of the Real Property, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; and (iii) all estoppel certificates and non-disturbance agreements desired by Buyer in respect of any real property leases included in the Purchased Assets, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and to the parties providing such certificates and agreements. Seller agrees to cooperate as reasonably requested by Buyer (and at Buyer\'s expense) in its efforts to obtain any such items, provided that Seller shall not be required to make any payment to any third party or incur any economic burden in connection therewith, and provided that Buyer\'s obtaining any such item shall not be a requirement of or a condition to the Closing. In addition, with respect to Seller\'s cooperation with Buyer\'s reasonable requests to obtain title insurance under subsection (i) above, Seller, except to the extent required to satisfy the Closing condition set forth in Section 8.2(f), and except for such actions as may be necessary to enable Buyer\'s title insurance company to insure title to the applicable Real Property as vested in Buyer, shall not be required to cure any purported defects, cause any exceptions to be deleted, or provide any affidavits, indemnities, or representations to any title company issuing such title insurance.

 

 7.16 _Central or Shared Functions for Transition Period_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the Natural Gas Distribution Business is currently dependent upon the Central or Shared Functions, and that the Purchased Assets will not include the employees or assets necessary for 

 

56

Buyer to perform such functions. Buyer intends to replace the Central or
Shared Functions through affiliated interest arrangements that will require
certain regulatory approvals, and Buyer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such regulatory approvals prior to Closing. If Buyer is
unable to obtain such regulatory approvals prior to Closing, at the written
request of Buyer made not fewer than 90 days prior to Closing, Seller agrees
to provide those Central or Shared Functions requested by Buyer,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transitional Services
Agreement from and after the Effective Time until such regulatory approvals
are obtained, but in any event for a period no greater than six months after
the Effective Time. Buyer may also request transitional services under other
circumstances, and Seller will provide such transitional services subject to
the Transitional Services Agreement to the extent that it provided similar
services for the Natural Gas Distribution Business immediately prior to
Closing and to the extent that it is reasonably able to provide such
services. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of its progress in
obtaining the regulatory approvals referred to in this Section 7.16 and will
upon Seller\'s written request promptly report upon the likelihood of its
need to make a request for services under this Section 7.16. Any arrangement
for provision of transitional services by Seller after the Effective Time in
accordance with this Section 7.16 will be set forth in the Transitional
Services Agreement reflecting the requirements of this Section 7.16.

 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

>  
>
> (a) _Third Party Claims_. If an Indemnitee receives  notice of the
> assertion or commencement of any Claim by any Person who is  neither a
> Party to this Agreement nor an Affiliate of a Party to this  Agreement (a "
> _Third Party Claim_ ") for which the Indemnitee  claims a right to
> indemnification hereunder from the other Party (the " _Indemnifying  Party_
> "), the Indemnitee will promptly give written notice of such  Third Party
> Claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice will describe the  nature of
> the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the  estimated
> amount, to the extent practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that  the
> Indemnitee claims it has sustained or may sustain as a result of such 
> Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, 
> will have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the 
> defense of the Third Party Claim while reserving its right to contest the 
> issue of whether it is liable to the Indemnitee for any indemnification 
> hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim.
>
>  
>
> (b) _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If the  Indemnifying Party assumes the
> defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to  Section 9.3(a), the
> Indemnifying Party will appoint counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the
> Indemnitee for the defense of such Third Party Claim,  will diligently
> pursue such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee reasonably  informed with
> respect to such defense. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with  the
> Indemnifying Party and its counsel, including permitting reasonable  access
> to books, records, and personnel, in connection with the defense of  any
> Third Party Claim (provided, that any out-of-pocket costs incurred by  the
> Indemnitee in providing such cooperation shall be paid by the  Indemnifying
> Party). The Indemnitee will have the right to participate in  such defense,
> including appointing separate counsel, but the costs of such  participation
> shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying  Party will have
> full authority, in consultation with the Indemnitee, to make  all decisions
> and determine all actions to be taken with respect to the  defense and
> settlement of the Third Party Claim, including the right to pay, 
> compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim at the 
> Indemnifying Party\'s expense; provided, that any such settlement will be 
> subject to the prior consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be 
> unreasonably

 9.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, and local Income Tax purposes.

 

 9.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, except as specifically provided in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c), no Party will, in any event, be liable to the other Party, either in contract or in tort, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages of the other Party, including loss of future revenue, income, or profits, diminution of value, or loss of business reputation or opportunity, relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other Party in advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party. The exclusion of consequential, incidental, indirect, special, and punitive damages as set forth in the preceding sentence does not apply to any such damages sought by third parties against Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, in connection with Losses that may be indemnified pursuant to this Article IX.

Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or any covenant or agreement to be performed hereunder will be indemnification in accordance with this Article IX and the remedies provided for in Section 10.4. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims, and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against the other arising under or based upon any Law (including any such Law under or relating to environmental matters), common law, or otherwise.

 10.4 _Specific Performance_. This Agreement is being entered into (i) by Buyer as a strategic action in furthering Buyer\'s business strategy, and (ii) by Seller as part of a strategic corporate-wide restructuring process, and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will be a significant contributing factor to the success of such process. The Parties acknowledge that any failure to consummate the transactions provided for herein will frustrate the Parties\' respective objectives in entering into this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties agree and stipulate that the Purchased Assets are unique, and that (x) any failure to consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement due to breach of this Agreement by either Party would result in irreparable injury to the other Party, (y) in the event of any such failure to consummate such transactions, it would be very difficult or impracticable to determine monetary damages caused by such a breach, and (z) in any event, monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Parties expressly agree that, in the event of breach of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party will, in addition to any other rights and remedies hereunder (except under Section 10.3(b) or Section 10.3(c)), have the right to enforce this Agreement by obtaining an order for specific performance of the Parties\' obligations hereunder.

 11.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, nor is this Agreement intended to confer upon any other Person except the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. No provision of this Agreement creates any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of Seller (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment or resumed employment, and no provision of this Agreement creates any rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement except as expressly provided for thereunder.

 11.6 _Severability_.

There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, or undertakings in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein, and it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, or undertakings contained in any other material made available to Buyer, including any such material made available in any data room information, confidential information memoranda, management information presentations, or otherwise. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to such transactions.
