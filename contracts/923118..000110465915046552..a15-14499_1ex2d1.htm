Company for federal income tax purposes; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers, and also

 **ARTICLE II _ 
THE PORTFOLIO CONTRIBUTION, THE REDEMPTION AND THE MERGERS_**

 



 

Section 2.01 _Contribution of Redemption Property Portfolio in Exchange for
DownREIT Partnership Units_. One Business Day prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, the Partnership shall, in accordance with the terms of the
Contribution Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions precedent to the Portfolio Contribution set forth therein, effect
the Portfolio Contribution by contributing the Redemption Property Portfolio
to DownREIT Partnership in exchange for a number of DownREIT Partnership
Units, cash and rights to subscribe for and purchase shares of Series F
Preferred Stock, in each instance to be determined in accordance with the
terms of the Contribution Agreement. The time at which the Portfolio
Contribution closes is referred to herein as the " _Portfolio Contribution
Effective Time_." Each DownREIT Partnership Unit received by the Partnership
in connection with the Portfolio Contribution shall entitle the Partnership to
the rights, duties and obligations as a limited partner of DownREIT
Partnership as more fully set forth in the Agreement of Limited Partnership of
DownREIT Partnership to be entered into prior to the Portfolio Contribution
Effective Time and substantially in the form attached to the Contribution
Agreement (the " _DownREIT Partnership Agreement_ "); _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall have the right to distribute such
DownREIT Partnership Units to the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in
connection with the Redemption as and to the extent set forth in _Section
2.02_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that in
the event the Contribution Agreement is terminated prior to the Portfolio
Contribution Effective Time in accordance with its terms, then the obligations
of the Public Parties and the Partnership to effectuate the Portfolio
Contribution and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
automatically terminate. The parties intend that for federal and applicable
state and local income tax purposes, the Portfolio Contribution will be
treated as a non-taxable contribution by the Partnership of the Redemption
Property Portfolio to DownREIT Partnership in exchange for partnership
interests in DownREIT Partnership, with no gain required to be recognized by
the Partnership or any partners in the Partnership as a result thereof.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Redemption of Partnership Units for DownREIT Partnership Units_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the requirements set forth in this _Section 2.02(a)_, each
eligible holder of Partnership Units shall be entitled, with respect to all or
any portion of such holders Partnership Units, to elect to have his, her or
its Partnership Units redeemed in exchange for his, her or its respective Per
Unit Redemption Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ (a " _Redemption
Election_ ") as follows:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall prepare and mail to the holders of Partnership Units
a form of election with respect to each Partnership Unitholders option to
elect to make a Redemption Election (the " _Form of Election_") (which shall
state therein the date and time that constitutes the Election Time) in
accordance with _Section 8.02(a)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) a Redemption Election by a Partnership Unitholder shall be deemed to have
been properly made only if the Partnership shall have received at its
principal executive office, not later than the time of the Partnership
Unitholders Meeting (the " _Election Time_ "), a properly completed and signed
Form of Election specifying that such holder elects to make a Redemption
Election and properly completed and signed Required Redemption Election
Documents;

 



 

(iii) a Redemption Election and the Form of Election (A) may be revoked by any
holder of a Partnership Unit only by written notice received by the
Partnership prior to the Election Time, and (B) shall be irrevocable by any
holder of Partnership Units if delivered to the Partnership prior to the
Election Time and not timely revoked in accordance with the foregoing clause
(A) ( _provided_ that all Forms of Election shall automatically be revoked if
the Partnership Unitholder Approval is not obtained at the Partnership
Unitholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof));

 



 

(iv) the Partnership, Parent and Public REIT by mutual agreement shall have
the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing the validity and implementation of Forms of Election and the
distribution and delivery of DownREIT Partnership Units, as shall be necessary
or desirable to fully effect such elections, and if the Partnership and
DownREIT Partnership by mutual agreement determine that any Redemption
Election was not properly made, the Partnership Units with respect to which
such election was not properly made, other than the Dissenting Units, shall be
converted into Partnership Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.02(a)_, and such determination shall be binding;

 



 

(v) each holder of Partnership Units, as a condition to making a Redemption
Election with respect to such holders Partnership Units, shall represent to
the Partnership and DownREIT Partnership that such holder is an Accredited
Investor, and such representation shall be in the form of the Accredited
Investor Questionnaire and shall be effective only if received by the
Partnership prior to the Election Time; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, any holder of Partnership Units that makes a Redemption Election to
receive DownREIT Partnership Units that is not an Accredited Investor or has
failed to represent that it is an Accredited Investor shall only be entitled
to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration;

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Partnership Units shall be entitled to be redeemed in exchange for its
respective Per Unit Redemption Consideration in connection with the Redemption
unless such holder provides the Partnership and DownREIT Partnership, prior to
the Election Time, with duly completed and executed Required Redemption
Election Documents; and

 



 

(vii) the Partnership shall, and Public REIT shall cause DownREIT Partnership
to, reasonably cooperate with each holder of Partnership Units who validly
elects to be redeemed in exchange for its respective Per Unit Redemption
Consideration in connection with the Redemption to take all other reasonable
and necessary steps so that such holders shall enjoy the full rights and
benefits of the DownREIT Partnership Units.

 



 

(b) Immediately following the Portfolio Contribution Effective Time, all
holders of Partnership Units (other than the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and subject to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.02(c)_) who qualify as Accredited Investors and who shall have
properly submitted and not have subsequently withdrawn Forms of Election or
the Required Redemption Election Documents in accordance with the procedures
and time periods specified in _Section 2.02(a)_, all in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereof and as contemplated hereby, electing to have their
Partnership Units (or a portion thereof) redeemed in exchange for DownREIT
Partnership Units, shall, to the extent so elected, have their Partnership
Units redeemed (with an aggregate value equal to the Aggregate Redemption
Value (as defined below)) by the Partnership, and the Partnership agrees to
redeem such Partnership Units, in exchange for (i) a number of DownREIT
Partnership Units equal to, in the aggregate, the quotient determined by
dividing the Aggregate Redemption Value by the DownREIT Partnership Unit
Value, (ii) cash in the amount equal to the number of DownREIT Partnership
Units to be received by the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in connection
with the Redemption, as provided in clause (i), multiplied by the Cash
Redemption Amount and (iii) the right to subscribe for and purchase a number
of shares of Series F Preferred Stock equal to the number of DownREIT
Partnership Units to be received by the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in
connection with the Redemption, as provided in clause (i), in accordance with
the terms of the Series F Subscription Agreement (collectively, the "
_Aggregate Redemption Consideration_ "). Such redemption distributions shall
be made to the individual Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in proportion to
their respective Redemption Percentages (each Redeeming Partnership
Unitholders respective Redemption Percentage of the Aggregate Redemption
Consideration, the " _Per Unit Redemption Consideration_ "). No fractional
DownREIT Partnership Units shall be distributed to any Redeeming Partnership
Unitholder in the Redemption. Instead, the number of DownREIT Partnership
Units (and the rights to subscribe for Series F Preferred Stock) to be
distributed to the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in the Redemption shall
be rounded to the nearest whole number of DownREIT Partnership Units (or the
nearest whole number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock), with one-half of
a DownREIT Partnership Unit (or share of Series F Preferred Stock, as
applicable) being rounded up to a whole DownREIT Partnership Unit (or to a
whole share of Series F Preferred Stock); _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall in no event distribute more
DownREIT Partnership Units to the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders than the
number of DownREIT Partnership Units issued to the Partnership in the
Portfolio Contribution. Each DownREIT Partnership Unit distributed to the
Redeeming Partnership Unitholders in connection with the Redemption shall
entitle the Redeeming Partnership Unitholders to the rights, duties and
obligations as a limited partner of DownREIT Partnership as more fully set
forth in the DownREIT Partnership Agreement. Promptly following the Redemption
Effective Time, DownREIT Partnership shall, and Public REIT shall cause
DownREIT Partnership to, deliver to each Redeeming Partnership Unitholder a
notice confirming such holders record ownership of the DownREIT Partnership
Units distributed to such holder pursuant hereto in respect of such holders
Partnership Units. Each Redeeming Partnership Unitholder shall automatically
be admitted as a limited partner of DownREIT Partnership at the Redemption
Effective Time. If immediately following the Portfolio Contribution Effective
Time, the Partnership does not have enough available cash to fund the entirety
of the cash portion of the Aggregate Redemption Consideration, Parent shall
loan to the Partnership an amount in cash necessary to fund such shortfall on
terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Partnership.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 2.02(b)_, if (i)
there shall have been entered an Order by which the Redemption Election
Documents delivered by an electing

 



       
 

 



 

Partnership Unitholder shall have become invalidated or the effectiveness
thereof stayed (including, without limitation, as a result of the entry of an
order for relief with respect to such electing Partnership Unitholder under
the United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended), or (ii) the Redemption
of an electing Partnership Unitholders Partnership Units becomes impossible
because, due to circumstances specific to such Partnership Unitholder, the
electing Partnership Unitholders Redemption Election has, as a matter of
applicable law, become revocable (and has been revoked), notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.02(a)(iii), or is no longer effective to bind such
Partnership Unitholder or his, her or its heirs, devisees, executor,
administrator, successors or assigns, and in the case of this clause (ii), an
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Public REIT, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Public REIT, shall have been delivered to
Public REIT to such effect, or Parent shall have received advice from outside
legal counsel to such effect in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Public REIT and, based on such advice of counsel, Public REIT shall have
determined in good faith that such revocation has occurred or that the
Partnership Unitholders Redemption Election is no longer effective, then such
Partnership Unitholder shall be an " _Exempted Redeeming Unitholder_ ". If a
Partnership Unitholder is an Exempted Redeeming Unitholder, such Partnership
Unitholder shall nevertheless be considered a "Redeeming Partnership
Unitholder" for purposes of determining the number of DownREIT Partnership
Units to be issued under the Contribution Agreement, but the Partnership Units
held by such Exempted Redeeming Unitholder shall not be redeemed in exchange
for the Per Unit Redemption Consideration at the Redemption Effective Time and
shall instead be converted into the right to receive the Partnership Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(d) In connection with the Portfolio Contribution and the Redemption and
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Public REIT, DownREIT Partnership and
the Partnership shall enter into the Tax Protection Agreement (as defined in
the Contribution Agreement), to which each Redeeming Partnership Unitholder
may become a party in accordance with the Redemption Election Documents.

 



 

(e) Except with respect to a Redeeming Partnership Unitholder that has
contributed property to the Partnership in exchange for Redemption OP Units in
the seven years prior to the Redemption, the Company and the Partnership
intend that, for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the Redemption
will be treated as a non-taxable distribution of property in the form of the
DownREIT Partnership Units from the Partnership to the Redeeming Partnership
Unitholders in liquidation and redemption of the Redeeming Partnership
Unitholders entire interests in the Partnership under Section 731 of the
Code, with no gain required to be recognized by the Redemption Partnership
Unitholders or the Partnership as a result thereof, subject to each Redeeming
Partnership Unitholder continuing to be allocated a portion of the
Indebtedness of DownREIT Partnership as necessary to avoid income or gain
attributable to any "negative tax capital account" attributable to such
holder.

 



 

(f) Concurrently with the Redemption, the Partnership shall assume and the
Company and the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless all Redeeming
Partnership Unitholders from all liability under debt guarantees previously
executed by Redeeming Partnership Unitholders, to the extent that such
guarantee agreements or obligations are related to any debt of the Company,
the Partnership or an affiliate of the Company or the Partnership. After the
Company Merger, Parent shall guarantee all such obligations. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that none of Public REIT, DownREIT
Partnership or any

 



      
 

 



 

of their respective Affiliates shall assume any obligations under any Tax
Protection Contracts entered into prior to the Redemption Effective Time, and
that the sole and exclusive obligations of Public REIT, DownREIT Partnership
or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to tax protection or to
make available guarantee opportunities to any Redeeming Partnership
Unitholders shall be as provided in the Tax Protection Agreement (as defined
in the Contribution Agreement).

 



 

Section 2.03 _Mergers_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the MGCL and the MLLCA, at the Company Merger Effective Time, MergerSub
and the Company shall consummate the Company Merger pursuant to which (i) the
Company shall be merged with and into MergerSub and the separate existence of
the Company shall thereupon cease and (ii) MergerSub shall be the surviving
entity in the Company Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "), such that
following the Company Merger, the Surviving Company will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance
with the NYRLPA and the NYLLCL, at the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Partnership and Partnership MergerSub shall consummate the Partnership Merger
pursuant to which (i) Partnership MergerSub shall be merged with and into the
Partnership and the separate existence of Partnership MergerSub shall
thereupon cease and (ii) the Partnership shall be the surviving entity in the
Partnership Merger (the " _Surviving Partnership_ "). The Partnership Merger

(b) _Stock Transfer Books; Unit Transfer Books_.

 



 

(i) At the Company Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of the Company Common Shares. On or after the Company Merger
Effective Time, any Stock Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the

after the Company Merger Effective Time (but in any event within five Business
Days), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, as applicable, held Company Common Shares or
Partnership Units that were exchanged for the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration (each, a " _Former Equityholder_ ") pursuant to _Section
3.01_ or _Section 3.02_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that, if applicable, delivery of Stock Certificates or Unit Certificates (if
any) shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates
and Unit Certificates (if any) shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon
delivery of the Stock Certificates

 



      
 

 



 

or Unit Certificates (if any) to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify) and (ii) if applicable, instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Former Equityholders Stock Certificates or Unit
Certificates (if any) in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon (i) if applicable, surrender by a
Former Equityholder of a Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate (if any) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably
satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, and (ii) delivery
by such Former Equityholder of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, such Former
Equityholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares or
Partnership Units, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_, and the Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate (if any) so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of any Company Common Share or Partnership Unit that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company or the Partnership, as
applicable, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate (if any) so surrendered is
registered, if such Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate (if any) shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate (if any) or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.04_, each Stock Certificate or
Unit Certificate (if any) (other than the Company-Owned Partnership Units)
shall be deemed at any time after the Company Merger Effective Time or the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, as the case may be, to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section 3.04_.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_.

 



 

(i) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, holders of Company
Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of
the Company other than the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration provided under this _Article III_. The Company Common Share
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares, regardless of whether
represented by Stock Certificates or other similar certificates exchanged
therefore. The Company Option and Stock-Based Consideration paid with respect
to Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Stock Units and Company
Dividend Equivalent Rights in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the canceled Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units and Company Dividend Equivalent Rights, as applicable,
and on and after the Company Merger Effective Time the holder of any Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Dividend Equivalent
Rights shall have no further rights with respect thereto, other than the right
to receive the Company Option and Stock-Based Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.03_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) At and immediately following the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each
person who held Partnership Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to which no
Redemption Election was made) shall cease to be, and shall have no right as,
an equityholder of the Partnership other than the right to receive the
Partnership Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_.

 



 

(iii) The applicable Merger Consideration paid or delivered in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid or
delivered, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Dividend Equivalent Rights and
Partnership Units exchanged therefore.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares (including
Company Restricted Stock) or Partnership Units for 12 months after the Company
Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, and any
holders of Company Common Shares (including Company Restricted Stock) or
Partnership Units prior to the applicable Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Buyer Parties, Company Parties, Public REIT or
the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, stockholder, partner,
agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any person in respect of any
Merger Consideration or any Company Option and Stock-Based Consideration, as
the case may be, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders or any persons entitled to Merger
Consideration immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration and Partnership Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make all
such payments in full.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond or payment of an applicable fee in such
amount as Parent or the Paying Agent reasonably may direct, the Paying Agent
(or, if subsequent

 



       
 

 



 

to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 3.04(e)_, the
Surviving Company) will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Stock Certificate or Unit Certificate the applicable Company Common Share
Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Company, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, the Surviving Partnership,
MergerSub, Partnership MergerSub, Parent, Public REIT, DownREIT Partnership or
the Paying Agent (each, a " _Withholding Agent_ "), as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as it is required, in the good faith
determination of the applicable Withholding Agent, to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to the Company Stock
Options, the Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Dividend Equivalent
Rights, the vesting thereof) under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration paid pursuant to this _Article
III_.

 



 

Section 3.06 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 



 

(a) No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the
Company Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby except as set
forth in _Section 3.06(b)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof and to the extent available under the
NYRLPA, Partnership Units that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Partnership
Unitholder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights, if any,
under § 121-1102 of the NYRLPA (the " _Dissenting Units_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the applicable Partnership Merger
Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Units shall instead be entitled
to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to § 121-1102 of
the NYRLPA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Partnership Unitholder
shall have failed to perfect or otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such
rights, if any, to appraisal and payment under the NYRLPA, such holders
Partnership Units shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable
Partnership Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.02(a)_ hereof,
without any interest thereon, and such Partnership Units shall no longer be
Dissenting Units. The Partnership shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Partnership, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the NYRLPA by a holder of
Dissenting Units and received by the Partnership. Parent shall participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the NYRLPA. The Partnership shall not, except with prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to suspend the
Companys Dividend Reinvestment and

 



      
 

 



 

Direct Stock Purchase Plan (the " _DRIP_ "), effective prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, and ensure that no purchase or other rights under the

Partnership is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation or foreign partnership, as the case may be, and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business it is
conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and the Partnership has all requisite corporate or limited
partnership power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its
properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

(b) Each of the Companys subsidiaries (including the Partnership, the "

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership) has the requisite corporate, limited
partnership, limited liability company or similar power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company Subsidiaries (other than
the Partnership) is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation, and is in good standing (to the extent applicable), in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the conduct or nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

thereto, under the Financing Commitments, and Parent has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to

obtained. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn,
qualified or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Company Merger in compliance with _Sections 8.04(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_ , the
Company Board shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that
they approve this Agreement, the Company Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall include such recommendations in the
Proxy Statement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). Subject to _Sections
8.04(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_ , the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
solicit or cause to be solicited from the Company Stockholders proxies in
favor of the approval of this Agreement, the Company Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Company
Stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable Law to obtain
such approvals. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
8.01(b)_, if, on the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make
one or more successive postponements or adjournments (but in no event beyond
the date that is three Business Days prior to the Outside Date) of the Company
Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the times reasonably
necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Company Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Confidential Offering Memorandum; Partnership Unitholders
Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and

thereunder, (ii) a proxy statement sent to the Partnership Unitholders to

time period set forth herein. The Partnership shall provide Parent and Public
REIT reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Confidential Offering
Memorandum (and any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to delivery thereof
to the Partnership Unitholders and, subject to the reasonable approval of the
Partnership, shall include any disclosure in the Confidential Offering
Memorandum as reasonably requested by Parent or Public REIT. Notwithstanding
any other provisions herein to the contrary, the Partnership shall not deliver
the Confidential Offering Memorandum to the Partnership Unitholders without
the prior consent of Parent and Public REIT (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(b) The Partnership shall, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the limited partners of
the Partnership (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) (the "
_Partnership Unitholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, for the purpose of obtaining the Partnership Unitholder
Approval. The Partnership shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Partnership Unitholders Meeting to occur 20 days after the date the
Confidential Offering Memorandum is mailed to the Partnership Unitholders.
Subject to _Sections 8.04(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_ , the Company Parties will
use reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from the
Partnership Unitholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Partnership
Merger and will use reasonable best efforts to take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Partnership Unitholder
Approval. If instructed by Parent, the Partnership shall postpone or adjourn
the Partnership Unitholders Meeting until a date determined by Parent in its
sole discretion (but in no event beyond the date that is three Business Days
prior to the Outside Date) if, in Parents sole discretion, such postponement
or adjournment is necessary or advisable in order to secure the vote or
consent of the Partnership Unitholders necessary to obtain the Partnership
Unitholder Approval. In addition, the Company and the Partnership may make one
or more successive postponements or adjournments (but in no event beyond the
date that is three Business Days prior to the Outside Date) of the Partnership
Unitholders Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the times reasonably
necessary to secure the vote or consent of the Partnership Unitholders
necessary to obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the Interim Period, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its
Representatives, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance
with this _Section 8.03_, reasonable access during normal business hours to
the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities,
books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, and all other
financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary or Representative shall be required to provide such access
if it reasonably determines that such access is reasonably likely to
materially disrupt or impair the business or operations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and (b) the foregoing shall not require the Company to
disclose any information to the extent it reasonably determines that such
disclosure is reasonably likely to (i) result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or (ii) violate any
applicable Law or any confidentiality obligation of such party ( _provided_
that the Company and the Company

 



   

     
 

 



 

Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent from the
applicable Third Party or enter into a customary joint defense agreement to
enable the disclosure of such information). No investigation conducted under
this _Section 8.03_, however, shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and
Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with parties with which
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries have a business relationship
(including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that, after the Partnership Unitholder Approval has been
obtained, Parent shall be permitted, after consultation with the Company, to
contact and communicate with parties with which the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries have a business relationship (including tenants/subtenants)
regarding the business of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall be
entitled to have Representatives present at all times during any such contact
or communication; _provided further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.03(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict Parent, its
Representatives or its Affiliates from contacting such parties in pursuing the
business of Parent operating in the ordinary course.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement dated April 7, 2015 between Lone
Star Americas Acquisitions, LLC and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the
terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the termination hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its
Representatives may furnish Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) to the Public Parties and to any other Person in
connection with such Persons potential investment in or provision of
financing to Parent or its affiliates or evaluation of the acquisition of
assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with or
following the Closing (including any connection with any transactions effected
pursuant to _Section 2.09_ hereof), in each case, so long as any such Person
has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company substantially
similar to the Confidentiality Agreement or has agreed in writing to be bound
by the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as if an
original party signatory thereto.

 



 

(c) All information obtained by the Public Parties pursuant to this _Section
8.03_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated May 23, 2015 (the " _Public_ _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between Public REIT and the Company.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that the sharing between
Parent, on the one hand, and any Public Party, on the other hand, will not
result in (i) any Public Party being a "Representative" (within the meaning of
the Confidentiality Agreement) of Parent or (ii) Parent being a
"Representative" (within the meaning of the Public Confidentiality Agreement)
of any Public Party.

 



 

Section 8.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to _Sections 8.04(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_ , during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and

 



      
 

 



 

continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is 30 days
after the date of this Agreement (the " _Go Shop Period End Time_ "), the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may and
shall have the right to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal, offer or
other action that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, including by way of contacting third parties, broadly
disseminating public disclosure or providing access to the properties,
offices, assets, books, records and personnel of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and furnishing non-public information pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company has previously furnished, made available or
provided access to such non-public information to Parent or concurrently does
so; (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries, proposals,
offers or other actions or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release
any Person from, or refrain from enforcing, any standstill agreement or
similar obligation to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and (iv)
disclose to the Company Stockholders any information required to be disclosed
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of this clause
(iv) such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if not
accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Go Shop Bidder_ " shall mean any
Person (including its controlled Affiliates and Representatives) that submits
a proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal prior to the Go Shop
Period End Time that the Company Board determines, prior to the Go Shop Period
End Time, has resulted in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(b) Except as permitted by, and subject to, _Sections 8.04(d)_ , _(e)_ and
_(f)_ , and except with respect to a Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go
Shop Period End Time until the earlier of the Company Merger Effective Time or
the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article X_, the Company
shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal, offer or other action
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person, or furnish to any Person other
than the Parent Parties any non-public information, in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any Person from
or fail to enforce any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or amend or modify the Ownership
Transfer Waiver in any manner adverse to any Buyer Party, (iv) withdraw,
modify or amend the Company Recommendation or the Ownership Transfer Waiver in
any manner adverse to any Buyer Party or fail to make the Company
Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any event described in this clause (iv), a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "), (v) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, or (vi) enter into any agreement in principle, arrangement,
understanding, contract or agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. For
the avoidance of doubt, after the Go Shop Period End Time until the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives may continue to take any of the actions
described in _Section 8.04(a)_ with respect to any proposals or offers
regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Go Shop Bidder on or before
the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or modified
proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board has determined in good faith following consultation with its legal and
financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal (as may be amended or
modified) is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go Shop Bidder if the
negotiations between the Company and such Go Shop Bidder with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go Shop
Bidder shall have been terminated.

 



 

(c) Except as permitted by, and subject to, _Sections 8.04 (b)_ , _(d)_ ,
_(e)_ and _(f)_ , upon the Go Shop Period End Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person (other than any Go Shop Bidders and the Parent
Parties) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person (other than any Go Shop Bidders
and the Parent Parties). Upon the Go Shop Period End Time, the Company shall
promptly request each Person (other than any Go Shop Bidders and the Parent
Parties) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, if any, to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
the extent required by such confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.04(c)_ shall preclude the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives from contacting any
such Person solely for the purpose of complying with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(d) If, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives receives a written Acquisition Proposal
which has not been initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly
facilitated in violation of _Section 8.04(b)_, and which the Company Board
has determined in good faith following consultation with its legal and
financial advisors is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives thereafter may (i) furnish, make available or provide access
to non-public information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and such
Persons Representatives ( _provided_ that the Company (A) has previously
furnished, made available or provided access to such non-public information to
Parent or concurrently does so and (B) furnishes, makes available or provides
access to such non-public information pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) disclose to the Company Stockholders any
information required to be disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of this clause (iii) such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if not accompanied by an express
public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation. From and after the date
of this Agreement, in the event the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives receives from a Person or group of
related Persons (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries from a Person
who informs the Company or any Company Subsidiary that it is considering
making or has made a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (but in no event more than 24
hours following) such receipt. Such notification

 



      
 

 



 

shall include, to the extent then known, the identity of the parties and a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in
writing, a written description thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with
copies of (to the extent in writing), and shall keep Parent apprised in all
material respects on a timely basis as to the status (including, within 24
hours after the occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including by furnishing copies
of any documentation and written correspondence that supplements or amends any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request in any material respect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the
preceding three sentences, nothing herein shall prohibit the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from contacting in
writing any Person submitting an Acquisition Proposal (that was not the result
of a violation of this _Section 8.04_) solely to clarify the terms of the
Acquisition Proposal for the sole purpose of the Company Board informing
itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality agreement that would prohibit it from providing such
information to Parent.

 



 

(e) At any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, upon
receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal (whether or not from a Go Shop Bidder), the Company Board may, if the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to subsection (iv)
below, (x) recommend that the Company Stockholders approve or accept such
Superior Proposal, which recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation, (y) make a Change in Recommendation, or (z) adopt, approve,
endorse or recommend, and authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement
and enter into an agreement relating to, or for the implementation of, such
Superior Proposal (and the Company may so terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this Agreement and enter into an agreement relating to, or for
the implementation of, such Superior Proposal); _provided_ that

 



 

(i) such Superior Proposal did not result from the Companys breach of its
obligations under this _Section 8.04_;

 



 

(ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its legal and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to recommend
that the Company Stockholders approve or accept such Superior Proposal, make a
Change in Recommendation or enter into an agreement related to the Superior
Proposal, attaching the most current version of such agreement (including any
amendments, supplements or modifications) to such notice (a " _Change Notice_
"); and

 



 

(iv) during the four Business Day period following Parents receipt of a
Change Notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its respective
financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted,
negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that, in circumstances involving or relating
to an

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal, the Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal;
_provided further_ that any amendment, supplement or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ or
make a Change in Recommendation pursuant clause (y) of this _Section 8.04(e)_
unless the Company has complied with the requirements of this _Section
8.04(e)_ with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal including sending
a Change Notice with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal and
offering to negotiate for three Business Days from such new Change Notice.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 8.04_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company Board or the Company, directly or indirectly, from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, including Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such disclosure addresses the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if not accompanied by an
express public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions contained in Article VII of the Company Articles or otherwise
cause any of such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken in
connection with a termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under any of the Organizational Documents or this
Agreement, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date
hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the
Company Merger Effective Time serving as a director or officer of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom, and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of each of the Indemnified Parties,
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, any Indemnifiable Expenses incurred in defending, serving
as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in
advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of
or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnifiable Expenses (as
hereinafter defined) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
including all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, in each case without
the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parents or the
Surviving Companys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Party to repay such Indemnifiable

 



      
 

 



 

Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving Companys written
consent and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties)
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single
Claim except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall
have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to
this _Section 8.05(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Company Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto).
All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to
the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. For purposes of this _Section 8.05(a)_ (x) the term "
_Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, whether
instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other party,
that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any such Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, at or prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and (y) the term " _Indemnifiable Expenses_ " means reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations
(including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this
_Section 8.05(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has been or
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless (i) such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or (ii) such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the
charter and bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Company Articles, Company
Bylaws or the applicable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees,
employees, agents, or fiduciaries (including fiduciaries under or with respect
to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3(3) of ERISA)) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
unless such modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum
extent required by Law.

 



 

(c) Parent or the Surviving Company shall maintain for a period of at least
six years from the Company Merger Effective Time the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, including, without
limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that (i) the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies
(including run-off or "tail" policies) of at least the same amounts and
containing other terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not
materially less advantageous to the insured persons; _provided_ that such
substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
matters occurring before the Company Merger Effective Time; (ii) in no event
shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section
8.05(c)_ more than an amount per year of coverage equal to 300% of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. The Company represents
that such annual premium amount is set forth in _Section 8.05(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Company would be required to expend more
than 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company, the Surviving
Company shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid
by the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company or its
successors or assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Company or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or Surviving Company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company assumes the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.05_.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in _Section 7.01_, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company Parties
and the Buyer Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions
to Closing set forth in _Article IX_ to be satisfied, (ii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the
Mergers.

 



 

(b) The Company Parties and the Buyer Parties agree to cooperate and assist
one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to this
_Section 8.06_, including the

 



      
 

 



 

preparation and making of the filings referred to in this Agreement and, if
requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder,
including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, upon
request, providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and
their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, none of the
parties will file any such document or have any communication with any
Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party. Each
of the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties shall keep the other apprised of
the content and status of any material communications with, and material
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable and
permitted by a Governmental Authority, each of the Company Parties and the
Buyer Parties shall permit representatives of the other party to participate
in meetings and calls with such Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Company Parties and
the Buyer Parties shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any
Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each Company Party and Buyer Party shall provide to the
other (or the others respective Representatives) upon request copies of all
correspondence and submissions between such party and any Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company Parties and the Buyer Parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this _Section 8.06_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties agrees to cooperate and
use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any Person in
order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts,
delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

 



 

(d) Each of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on
the other hand, shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
any Third Party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that any Company Party shall fail to obtain
any Third Party consent described above, the Company Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company Parties
and the Buyer Parties and their respective businesses resulting, or which
could reasonably be expected to result, after the Company Merger Effective
Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or
consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless required by the
applicable agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) none of the Buyer
Parties or their respective affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to
pay such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining any Third Party
consent from the holder of any mortgage indebtedness encumbering any Company
Property, the Buyer Parties shall pay all costs and expenses in connection
therewith including, without limitation, any consent fees, lender legal fees
and escrow and processing fees.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.
From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from the Merger
Consideration, all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in
Recommendation or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with
_Section 8.04_, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties hereto
agree that no public release or public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers) shall be
issued by a party without the prior consent of the other parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
_provided_ that a party may, without obtaining the other parties consent,
issue such release or announcement as may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to allow
the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint
press release announcing the Mergers and the execution of this Agreement and
shall make such joint press release no later than one Business Day following
the date on which this Agreement is signed.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Cooperation with Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause MergerSub to, use reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter (and the related fee letters), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on
terms and conditions contained therein or on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent and not in violation of this _Section 8.09_, (ii) to the extent within
the Buyer Parties control (rather than the Company Parties control or Public
REITs control), satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the
Buyer Parties in the Debt Commitment Letter (and the related fee letters),
(iii) except as provided below, maintain in full force and effect and comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter (and the related fee
letters) that are within its control, (iv) not take or fail to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or
materially delay the availability or funding of the Debt Financing, and

 



      
 

 



 

(v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it being
understood that it is not a condition to the Closing under this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Mergers, for Parent or MergerSub to obtain the Debt
Financing or any alternative financing); _provided_ , that such efforts shall
be subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.09(a)_. Parent shall have
the right, from time to time, to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Financing, and/or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources; _provided_ that
any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to, or
waiver of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter that amends the
Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (A) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in any
material respect that would make such conditions less likely to be satisfied,
(B) be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or (C) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (it
being understood that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
replacement financing consistent in all material respects with the terms of
the application executed as of June 12, 2015 by the Permanent Financing Source
and the terms of the related initial letter of commitment executed as of June
19, 2015 (together, the " _Preliminary Permanent Debt Commitment Documents_ ")
with such modifications as are customary for commitments by the Permanent
Financing Source for this type of financing (such financing, the " _Permanent
Financing_ ") shall be deemed to comply with the foregoing proviso and once
the commitment letter from the Permanent Financing Source and the related
amended letter of commitment referenced in the initial letter of commitment
executed as of June 19, 2015 have been executed (the " _Permanent Debt
Commitment Documents_ "), it is expressly agreed that the Debt Commitment
Letter referred to in Section 5.07(b)(ii) may be terminated). Parent shall as
promptly as practicable deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of or to the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the Preliminary Permanent Debt Commitment Documents and the
Permanent Debt Commitment Documents, but not with respect to any fee letter).
For purposes of this _Section 8.09_, references to "Financing" and "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing as
permitted to be amended, modified, replaced, supplemented or substituted by
this _Section 8.09(a)_ (including the Permanent Financing), and references to
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, modified, replaced, supplemented or substituted by this _Section
8.09(a)_ (including the Preliminary Permanent Debt Commitment Documents and
the Permanent Debt Commitment Documents). Parent shall be permitted to reduce
the amount of Financing under the Financing Commitments in its reasonable
discretion, _provided_ that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount
committed below the amount that is required, together with other financial
resources of Parent and MergerSub, including available cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities of the Buyer Parties, the Company, the Partnership
and their respective subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to consummate the
Mergers on the terms contemplated by this Agreement (which amount may be
reduced as a result of any purchase by the DownREIT Partnership of assets
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement), and _provided further_ that such
reduction shall not, except as provided above, (I) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitments in any
material respect that would make such conditions less likely to be satisfied

 



   

     
 

 



 

by the Closing Date or (II) be reasonably expected to prevent or materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting Parents other
obligations under this _Section 8.09(a)_, in the event (i) all or any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (or any related fee letters), (ii)
the Financing Commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Financing
expire or are terminated, or (iii) any Debt Commitment Letter is repudiated by
any party thereto (any such event, a " _Financing Failure Event_ "), Parent
shall (A) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the Company of
such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor of which Parent has
knowledge, (B) in consultation with the Company, use reasonable best efforts
to promptly obtain any such portion from alternative sources on terms not
materially less favorable to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment
of Parent taking into account the flex provisions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (or any related fee letters)) and in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such Financing Failure Event but in no event later
than the date of the Closing contemplated in _Section 2.06_, and (B) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company
with, a copy of a new financing commitment letter (but not including any fee
letter) (a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") that provides for such Alternate
Debt Financing. In the event any Alternate Debt Financing is obtained, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" shall
include the debt financing contemplated by such Alternate Debt Financing and
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitments" or the
"Debt Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to include, to the extent then in
effect, the Debt Commitment Letters that are not superseded by any New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters.
Parent shall give the Company prompt (and in any event within two Business
Days after it becomes aware) notice (A) of any material breach or default, or
any repudiation or termination by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related to the Financing and (B) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication, in each case from any Financing
Source with respect to any material breach or default, or any termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of
any Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Parent agrees to use, and shall cause MergerSub to
use, reasonable best efforts to enforce their respective rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter (and the related fee letters) and the definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing. In the event that
all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than the availability of
funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied or upon funding
will be satisfied, and the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.06_, each of Parent and MergerSub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Financing Sources providing such Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company Parties and the Buyer Parties agree and acknowledge that "reasonable
best efforts" will not be interpreted to require Parent, MergerSub,
Partnership MergerSub or any other Buyer Party to, and none of Parent,
MergerSub, Partnership MergerSub or any other Buyer Party shall

 



      
 

 



 

be required to, sue the Financing Sources or enforce or commence any other
legal proceeding in relation to the Financing Commitments.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives (including
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting) to use reasonable best efforts to
provide, all cooperation that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including the Permanent
Financing) ( _provided_ that such request is consistent with applicable Law
and does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in a way that is not customary in connection with the
arrangement of financing similar to the Financing), including (i) furnish such
financial, statistical and other pertinent information and projections
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, (ii) make appropriate officers of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries reasonably available for due diligence meetings and for
participation in meetings, presentations, road shows and sessions with rating
agencies and Financing Sources (including the Permanent Financing Source),
(iii) reasonably assist Parent and its Financing Sources with the preparation
of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Financing to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and
its Financing Sources for any Financing to be raised by Parent to complete the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) execute
and deliver documents, as of the Closing Date, as may be reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral, including any credit or purchase
agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements, security agreements, intercreditor
agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other security documents or other
certificates, documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of
collateral and other matters ancillary to the Financing (including a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters), (vi) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, form new direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and conditioned on the
occurrence of the Company Merger and effective as of the Company Merger
Effective Time, (vii) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, transfer or
otherwise restructure its ownership of existing Company Subsidiaries,
properties or other assets, in each case, pursuant to documentation reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and conditioned on the occurrence of the Company Merger
and effective as of the Company Merger Effective Time, (viii) provide
reasonable access to diligence materials, appropriate personnel and properties
to allow Financing Sources (including the Permanent Financing Source) and
their representatives to complete all due diligence (subject to execution of
non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements reasonably acceptable to the
Company), (ix) provide reasonable assistance with respect to the review and
granting of mortgages and security interests in collateral for the Financing,
and attempting to obtain any consents associated therewith, (x) to the extent
reasonably requested by a Financing Source, obtain estoppels and certificates
from tenants, lenders, managers, franchisors, ground lessors and
counterparties to reciprocal easement agreement or other similar agreements to
which a member of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to any Financing Source or
potential Financing Source, (xi) reasonably cooperate in connection with the
repayment or defeasance of any existing Indebtedness of the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Company Merger Effective Time
including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under any
existing loans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries at such times
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (xii) to the extent reasonably
requested by a potential Financing Source (including the Permanent Financing
Source), permit Parent and its Representatives to conduct, at Parents sole
cost and expense, appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections of
each real estate property owned and, subject to obtaining required third party
consents with respect thereto (which the Company shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain), leased by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Parent shall schedule and coordinate all
inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least three
Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection that
Parent or its Representatives intend to conduct, and (B) the Company shall be
entitled to have representatives present at all times during any such
inspection), (xiii) using reasonable best efforts to provide monthly financial
statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily
prepares such financial statements within 25 days of the end of each month
prior the Closing Date, and (xiv) taking all corporate and, if applicable,
other actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof together with the cash at the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date to consummate the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.09_ or any other
provisions of this Agreement, (A) no obligation or liability of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument
relating to the Financing shall be effective until the Closing Date, and (B)
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any action (I) under any certificate, document or instrument relating to
the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing Date (including the
entry into any agreement that is effective before the Closing Date), (II) that
would reasonably be expected to cause any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability
relating to the Financing, (III) that will conflict with or violate its
Organizational Documents or any applicable Laws, or (IV) that would cause any
condition to the Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any
material breach of this Agreement. The Company will periodically update any
such information to be included in an offering document to be used in
connection with such Debt Financing in order to ensure that (i) such
information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not misleading, and (ii) such information complies in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of Law. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with their cooperation as described in this _Section 8.09(b)_.
Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or
incur any liability to any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement
of the Financing or any alternative financing that Parent or MergerSub may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not Closing occurs, other than to the extent provided in _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _10.04(c)_ , provided that if the Closing occurs, the Surviving Company will
be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Financing. The Buyer Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.09(b)_ or any
other provisions of this Agreement, (A) the condition set forth in _Section
9.02(a)(i)_, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section
8.09(b)_, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries cause or materially contribute to the failure of the Financing
(including the Permanent Financing or any alternative financing) to be
obtained, and (B) Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing (including the Permanent Financing or any
alternative financing), is not a condition to Closing, and each of Parent and
MergerSub reaffirms its obligations to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement subject only to the express
conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ , irrespective and
independent of the availability or terms of the Financing or any alternate
financing.

 



 

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b) above
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
(other than to the extent required to be included in any offering documents
pursuant to paragraph (b) above).

 



 

Section 8.10 _Resignations_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory
to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Company Merger Effective
Time, of those directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary designated
by Parent to the Company in writing at least five calendar days prior to the
Closing.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company Parties and the Buyer Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary so that no
takeover statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and if any takeover statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to take all necessary action to ensure that
such transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
takeover statute.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Delisting and Deregistering of Securities_. Parent and the
Surviving Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
Common Shares to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act promptly following the Company Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) continue to operate in such a manner as to permit the Company to continue
to qualify as a REIT throughout the period from the date hereof to the Company
Merger Effective Time;

 



 

(b) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them
(taking into account all applicable extensions of time to file such Tax
Returns) on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a
manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Laws;

 



 

(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed; and

 



 

(d) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and
financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Company Merger Effective Time in a manner
consistent with past practice.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Notices of Certain Events_.

 



 

(a) The Company Parties shall notify Parent promptly of (i) any written
communication and, to the knowledge of the Company, any other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person)
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), (ii) any material
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives), (iii) any material Actions threatened or commenced against
or otherwise affecting the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that are
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) any effect,
event, development or change between the date of this Agreement and the
Company Merger Effective Time that causes or is reasonably likely to cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_, _9.02_ or _9.04_ not to be
satisfied.

 



 

(b) The Buyer Parties shall notify the Company promptly of (i) any written
communication and, to the knowledge of Parent, any other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, any of its subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives), (ii) any material communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, any of its subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives), (iii) any material Actions threatened or
commenced against or otherwise affecting Parent or any of its subsidiaries
that are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
any effect, event, development or change between the date of this Agreement
and the Company Merger Effective Time that causes or is reasonably likely to
cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_, _9.03_ or _9.04_ not
to be satisfied.

 



 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. It is

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledged and agreed that Public REIT shall promptly receive a copy of any
notices provided pursuant to this _Section 8.14_.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Existing Notes_.

 



 

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, each of the Company and the
Partnership shall use reasonable best efforts to amend the applicable note
purchase agreements in order to provide that the Companys and the
Partnerships debt securities set forth in _Section 8.15_ of the Disclosure
Schedules (the " _Notes_ ") may be prepaid or redeemed on the Closing Date
(with such prepayment or redemption conditioned on the Closing of the Company
Merger) at a redemption price (the " _Note Redemption Price_ ") equal to
principal plus accrued interest to the Closing Date plus the Make-Whole
Premium (as that term is defined in the applicable note purchase agreement).
The Company and the Partnership shall be entitled to incur and pay reasonable
fees and expenses in connection with obtaining such amendment, subject to the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). If the Company and the Partnership are unable to
obtain such amendment to the applicable note purchase agreements within 45
days following the date hereof, unless the Parent Parties have waived the
Company Parties obligation to comply with this _Section 8.15_ prior to the
expiration of such 45-day period, the Partnership shall be entitled to
increase the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility or secure
a new credit facility on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent in an amount
necessary to fund the Note Redemption Price in the event the Closing does not
occur, and to pay reasonable fees, including commitment fees, and expenses in
connection therewith. It is expressly agreed by the parties hereto that the
failure to obtain the consent of the holders of the Notes in connection with
the amendments described above shall not be deemed a breach by the Company or
the Partnership under this Agreement or a failure of any condition hereto.

 



 

(b) If instructed to do so by Parent, the Company and the Partnership shall
deliver a notice of prepayment or redemption to each holder of Notes with
sufficient advance notice to enable the Notes to be prepaid or redeemed on the
Closing Date; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company or the Partnership
be obligated to deliver such notice of prepayment or redemption to each holder
of Notes until the Partnership Unitholder Approval has been obtained. If such
notice is delivered, immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or, if applicable, the Partnership or
the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, to promptly pay the Note
Redemption Price, using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent.

 



 

Section 8.16 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to give employees of the
Company as of the Closing Date who continue to be employed by the Surviving
Company immediately following the Closing (the " _Employees_ ") full credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under the employee
benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or its U.S. Affiliates in
which such Employees participate following the Closing Date for such
Employees service with the Company to the same extent recognized by
comparable plans of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ that no such credit will result in a duplication of benefits or
require any retroactive contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent or its U.S.
Affiliates for the benefit of Employees on and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to use reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under comparable plans of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts
paid by such Employees in the year of the Closing Date with respect to similar
plans maintained by the Company; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall Parent be obligated to cause the Surviving Company to
purchase new insurance policies in order to comply with this _Section
8.16(a)_.

 



 

(b) Upon the Closing, the Surviving Company hereby assumes the obligations
under the Amended and Restated Executive Retention Plan adopted by the Company
and the Partnership, as of February 12, 2011, including but not limited to
payment of any accrued bonus under the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan
for services rendered during the year in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to
be an amendment to any of the Plans or any other compensation or benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Company or Parent, (ii) prevent the amendment or
termination of any of the Plans or interfere with the right or obligation of
Parent to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law,
or (iii) otherwise operate to require Parent to duplicate any payments or
benefits payable pursuant to any of the Plans or other compensation or benefit
plans, policies, programs, agreements or other arrangements of Parent.

 



 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 8.16_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and
that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company, or (ii) to continued employment
following the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 8.17 _Existing Indebtedness_. At the direction of the Parent, the
Company and the Partnership shall deliver notices of prepayment or termination
(with such prepayment or termination conditioned on the Closing of the Company
Merger) relating to any loan agreement, letter of credit, indenture, note,
bond, debenture, mortgage or any other document, agreement or instrument
evidencing a capitalized leased obligation or other Indebtedness, including,
without limitation, any of the Indebtedness listed on _Section 4.17(g)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule, of the Company or any Subsidiary (other than in

that, subject to _Sections 10.04(g)_ , _11.06_ , _11.07_ and _11.09_ , nothing
herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for fraud or any willful
and material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination, in which
case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that termination

Section 10.04 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Sections 2.09_ , _8.06(d)_ , _8.07_ ,
_8.09(b)_ and this _Section 10.04_, all expenses (including fees and
expenses payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement

any covenant or agreement by the Company and at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the failure to obtain Company Stockholder Approval
(in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_) or prior
to the breach giving rise to such termination (in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(i)_ as a result of a willful breach of any
covenant or agreement by the Company), (A) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not conditional) or an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not conditional) shall have been made to the Company Board or directly to the

Termination Fee less any Parent Expenses previously paid pursuant to _Section
10.04(c)_, in immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent,

circumstances in which the Parent Expenses (or any portion thereof) are paid
pursuant to _Section 10.04(c)_, and the Public Parties are not in material
breach of this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement at the time of such
termination, then Parent shall pay to Public REIT the Public Party Expenses
(provided that such payment shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to the extent
that the entirety of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, as
applicable, are not actually paid to Parent) and (ii) if this Agreement is
terminated under any other circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee

paid pursuant to _Section 10.04(e)_ and the Public Parties are not in
material breach of this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement at the time of
such termination and (ii) the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement are not consummated, then the Company shall pay to Public REIT the
Pro Rata Termination Fee.

consummate the Portfolio Contribution under Section 5.01 of the Contribution
Agreement are satisfied and (ii) the Portfolio Contribution has not been
consummated as a result of the Public Parties breach under the Contribution

the Public Party Expenses, any other party), its subsidiaries and each of
their respective Representatives in respect of this Agreement, any agreement
executed in connection herewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the

Commitments, or the failure of the Company Merger, the Partnership Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and in such event, the Company shall not seek to, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to seek to, recover any money damages (including
consequential, indirect or punitive damages) or obtain any equitable relief
from any Parent Party.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
provisions of this _Section 10.04_ shall not affect the rights of the parties
under the Contribution Agreement to pursue the legal remedies provided for in
the Contribution Agreement in the event of a default or breach thereunder,
which rights will survive the termination of this Agreement unimpaired;
_provided_ that no Parent Party shall have any liability for any obligation or
liability to any Person for any breach of the Contribution Agreement or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Escrow of Company Expenses_.

 



 

(a) To the extent that the Company Parties recover the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 10.04(e)_ (such amount, the " _Damages Amount_ "),
Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Partnership from the
Damages Amount deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Damages Amount and (ii) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to the Partnership without causing the
Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
(" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Companys independent
certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event the Company receives
either (1) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has
received a ruling from the IRS described in _Section 10.05(b)_ or (2) an
opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in _Section
10.05(b)_, an amount equal to the Damages Amount less the amount payable under
clause (A) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Damages Amount with
an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to _Section
10.05(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Partnership, Parent and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Damages Amount
pursuant to this _Section 10.05_ shall be made at the time Parent is
obligated to pay the Partnership such amount pursuant to _Section
10.04(e)(i)_ or _(ii) _by wire transfer or bank check.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Damages Amount in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Partnership unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the
Companys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Partnership without causing
the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants
revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount
to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the Damages Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Partnership of
the Damages Amount would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or
would not otherwise disqualify the Company as a REIT), in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Damages Amount to the
Partnership. Parent agrees to amend this _Section 10.05_ at the reasonable
request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Damages
Amount that may be distributed to the Partnership hereunder without causing
the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling
described in this _Section 10.05(b)_, or (z) assist the Company in obtaining
a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this
_Section 10.05(b)_. The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion
of the Damages Amount remaining in escrow on the date that is five years after
the date the Damages Amount was deposited into escrow shall be released by the
escrow agent to Parent. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be
borne solely by the Company.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the
other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any
condition to its own obligations contained herein; _provided_ that, without
the prior written consent of Public REIT, neither the Company nor Parent may
grant any such extension or waiver to the extent the extension or waiver (i)
relates to a representation, condition, covenant or other obligation which is
in whole or in part for the benefit of Public REIT or (ii) affects negatively
the rights of any Public Party under this Agreement or the Contribution
Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Company (on behalf of the Company Parties)
or Parent (on behalf of the Buyer Parties), as applicable. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights, and no single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Termination of Contribution Agreement_. In the event the
Contribution Agreement is validly terminated by any Public Party under
circumstances in which the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or before the Outside Date in
accordance with the provisions set forth in the Contribution Agreement, the
obligations of Public REIT set forth in this Agreement shall terminate except
that the provisions of _Section 8.03(c)_, _Section 10.02_, _Section 10.04_,
this _Section 10.07_ and _Article XI_ and the definitions of all defined
terms appearing in such sections shall survive any such termination.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

 

 ** _GENERAL PROVISIONS_**

 



 

Section 11.01 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant hereto, including any rights arising out
of any breach of such representations and warranties, shall terminate at the
Company Merger Effective Time. This _Section 11.01_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement of the parties hereto that by its terms contemplates
performance after the Company Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 11.02 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon confirmation of receipt) by delivery in

facsimile or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses or facsimile

Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of
this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 11.04 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their
respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any
time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(a) after the Company Stockholders Meeting, to the extent the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment may be made which decreases the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, and (b) after the Partnership
Unitholders Meeting, to the extent Partnership Unitholder Approval is
obtained, no amendment may be made which decreases the Partnership Merger
Consideration. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, _Sections 11.06_ , _11.08(b)_ , _11.09(d)_ and _11.13_ and
this _Section 11.04_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of _Sections 11.06_ , _11.08(b)_ , _11.09(d)_ and _11.13_ and this
_Section 11.04_) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
impacts or is adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without
the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 11.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the Limited Guarantee
and the Contribution Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not
be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempt
to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void,
_provided_ that that any of the Buyer Parties may assign this Agreement (i) to
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or (ii) after the
Company Merger Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder
if the assignee does not perform its obligations. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.04(e)_,
_Section 11.07_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies
expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party to this Agreement
of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

 



 

Section 11.07 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Company Parties and the Buyer Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, prior to any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_, and subject to _Sections
11.07(b)_ and _(c)_ and _Section 11.09_, the Company Parties and the Buyer
Parties acknowledge and agree that each Company Party and Buyer Party shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by a Company Party or a Buyer Party and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Courts of the
State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Courts_ "), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the
Partnership shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent,
MergerSub and Partnership MergerSub to draw down the Equity Financing or to
consummate the Mergers only if:

 



 

(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ (other than
(x) conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing and
(y) conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01(d)_ and _(e)_ if the Public
Parties stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Portfolio Contribution
and the Portfolio Contribution did not occur because Parent did not stand
ready, willing and able to complete the Closing) have been satisfied;

 



 

(ii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing (or any
replacement debt financing, if applicable) provided by the Debt Commitment
Letter (or any replacement debt financing, if applicable) have been satisfied
(other than the funding of the Equity Financing and those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing); and

 



 

(iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or any replacement
financing, if applicable) are funded, then the Closing will occur.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the
Partnership shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent,
MergerSub and Partnership MergerSub to draw down the Debt Financing (or any
replacement financing, if applicable) only if:

 



 

(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ (other than
(x) conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing and
(y) conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01(d)_ and _(e)_ if the Public
Parties stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Portfolio Contribution
and the Portfolio Contribution did not occur because Parent did not stand
ready, willing and able to complete the Closing) have been satisfied;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Parent and MergerSub have failed to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.06_; and

 



 

(iii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing (or any
replacement financing, if applicable) provided by the Debt Commitment Letter
(or any replacement financing, if applicable) have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 11.07_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require Parent, MergerSub or Partnership MergerSub to initiate, prosecute or
maintain any Action against any Financing Source or the other Persons
providing or obligated to provide the Debt Financing in the event of any
breach or purported breach of the Debt Commitment Letter by any such Person.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties hereby waives (i) any
defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

(f) In no event shall the exercise of the Companys and the Partnerships
right to seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section 11.07_ reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit the Companys right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ or _10.01(d)(iii)_ and be paid the Parent
Termination Fee.

 



 

Section 11.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than (a) following the Closing, the
Indemnified Parties, solely in the case of this _Section 11.08(a)_ and
_Section 8.05_ (and the definitions relating thereto), (b) the Financing
Sources, solely in the case of this _Section 11.08(b)_ and _Sections 11.04_ ,
_11.09(d)_ and _11.13_ (and the definitions relating thereto), (c) following
the Company Merger Effective Time and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company
Dividend Equivalent Rights, solely in the case of this _Section 11.08(c)_ and
in respect of their right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Company Option and Stock-Based Consideration in
accordance with _Article III_, (d) following the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, the Partnership Unitholders, solely in the case of this _Section
11.08(d)_ and in respect of their right to receive the applicable Partnership
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article III_, and (e) the Redeeming
Partnership Unitholders, solely in this _Section 11.08(e)_ and the
representations and warranties of Public REIT set forth in _Article VI_. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the parties. Accordingly, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
provisions of _Section 10.04(k)_ shall be enforceable against the Company
Parties (but not the Buyer Parties) by each Financing Source and its
successors and assigns, and (ii) the provisions of this _Section 11.08_ and
_Section 11.04_, _Section 11.09(d)_ and _Section 11.13_

 



      
 

 



 

shall be enforceable against all parties to this Agreement by each Financing
Source and its successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 11.09 _Governing Law; Forum; Limitations on Suits against Parent
Parties and Financing Sources_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and all disputes, claims or controversies (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Maryland without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Maryland.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents
to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Maryland Courts for
any litigation (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or
indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in
such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (i) to the extent such
party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland,
to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys
agent for acceptance of legal process, and (ii) that service of process may
also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail to the address for notice
set forth in _Section 11.02_ with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the
United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service
made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above shall have the same legal force and
effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland.

 



 

(c) Without limiting _Section 10.04(k)_ or _Section 11.09(d)_ or the
Companys ability to enforce this Agreement against Public REIT, this
Agreement may only be enforced by the Company with respect to the Parent
Parties against, and claims or causes of action that are based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement may only be made with respect to the Parent Parties by the
Company against, Parent, MergerSub, Partnership MergerSub and the Guarantor
(but only to the extent set forth in the Limited Guarantee), and the Company
shall not seek to enforce this Agreement against, or make any claims or causes
of action that are based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement against, any other
Parent Party.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing or the definitive

 



      
 

 



 

agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof) and (ii) any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New York. Each of the Company and the Partnership also agrees
that (A) neither it nor any of its Affiliates will bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the
definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance
thereof and (B) no Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise) to the Company, the Partnership or any of
their respective Affiliates or their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or equity holders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party under this Agreement or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or PDF transmission) in two or more counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior
or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND EACH
FINANCING SOURCE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OF OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND EACH FINANCING SOURCE (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) IN THE CASE OF THE PARTIES

 



      
 

 



 

HERETO, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 11.13_.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Authorship_. Each party hereto acknowledges that each party to
this Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree that the terms and language of this Agreement are the result of
negotiation between the parties hereto and their respective Representatives
and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this
Agreement shall be resolved against any party hereto. Any controversy over
construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of
authorship or negotiation.
