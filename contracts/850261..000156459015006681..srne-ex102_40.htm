control of all research, development and commercialization decisions and

use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to develop the Compound for gastric,
ovarian, prostate, melanoma and bladder cancers (and if Purchaser fails to use

within the five (5) year period following the Closing Date, then the parties
will negotiate in good faith the reversion of such rights to Seller for the
indications that have not been so developed). For the avoidance of doubt,
from and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall have complete
discretion and control with respect to the research, development and
regulatory strategy for the Compound in and for the Territory.

 

3.4 Co-Development and Co-Marketing Opportunity. During the first three (3)
years after the Closing Date, Seller may exercise a right, upon written
request to Purchaser, to obtain from Purchaser co-development and/or co-

Purchaser and Seller will negotiate the details of, and the definitive
agreement for, any such co-development and/or co-distribution/co-marketing
rights to the mutual satisfaction of both parties

 

3.5 IgDraSol Employees. During the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until sixty (60) days after the later of (a)

Closing Date (the "Transition Period"), Purchaser will conduct a review of the
IgDraSol Employees (as defined in Section 4.10) with the reasonable assistance
of Seller in order for Purchaser to determine which of the IgDraSol Employees
to retain ("Retained IgDraSol Employees"). Purchaser shall inform Seller and

Transition Period. Purchaser and the Company (and not Seller) shall be
responsible for all compensation and benefits of the Retained IgDraSol
Employees for services performed after the Transition Period. Seller shall
not terminate any of the IgdraSol Employees during the Transition Period
without cause. Seller (and not Purchaser or the Company) shall be responsible
for all compensation and benefits of the IgDraSol Employees for services
performed during the Transition Period and of the IgDraSol Employees (other
than the Retained IgDraSol Employees) after the Transition Period, including
any severance obligations. For clarity, any signing or retention bonus or
advances on compensation paid or offered by the Company or Purchaser during
the Transition Period shall not be considered part of the compensation and
benefits for which Seller is responsible for pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

 

3.6 Records and Audit Rights. Purchaser and Company shall maintain complete
and accurate records in sufficient detail to permit Seller to confirm the
accuracy of (a) the achievement of the milestones payable pursuant to Section
3.1 and (b) the amount of Compound purchased for Commercial Sale and the
supply price to verify the payments pursuant to Section 3.2. Upon reasonable
prior notice, such records shall be open during regular business hours for a
period of three (3) years from the creation of individual records for
examination by an independent certified public accountant selected by Seller
and reasonably acceptable to the Company for the sole purpose of verifying for
the Seller the accuracy of the achievement of milestones and payments from
Purchaser and Company pursuant to this Agreement or of any payments made, or
required to be made, by or to the Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Such
audits may occur no more often than once each calendar year. Such auditor
shall not disclose the Company's or Purchaser's confidential and/or
proprietary information to Seller, except to the extent such disclosure is
necessary to verify the accuracy of the reports and payments to Seller under
this Agreement. Any amounts shown to be owed but unpaid, or overpaid and in
need of refund, shall be paid within forty-five (45) days after the
accountant's report, plus (in the case of amounts owed with respect to
Compound purchased for Commercial Sale under Section 3.2) interest at the rate
of compound interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due from the due date
until the date of payment at a per annum rate of two percent (2%) over the
then-current prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal or the maximum
rate allowable by applicable law. Seller shall bear the full cost of such
audit unless such audit reveals underpayment by the audited party that
resulted from a discrepancy in the report provided by the audited party for
the audited period, which underpayment was more than five percent (5%) of the
amount set forth in such report, in which case the audited party shall
reimburse the Seller for the costs for such audit.

Liability of the Company arising out of, or accruing with respect to, its
conduct or operations prior to the Closing, whether under the Exclusive
Distribution or otherwise; (d) any Pre-Closing Taxes; (e) any Liability for
breaches of any Contracts on or prior to the Closing Date or any Liability for
payments or amounts due under any Contracts on or prior to the Closing Date
and (f) any Liability under the Excluded Contracts, including with respect to
breaches of any Excluded Contract or payment or amounts due under any Excluded
Contract.

 

7.3 Indemnification by Purchaser. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, "Seller Parties") from
any and all Damages, arising out of, relating to or resulting from, (a) any
breach of a representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or (b) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement; or (c) any Taxes that are the responsibility of Purchaser pursuant
to Section 8.4.

 

7.4 Procedures for Indemnification. Promptly after receipt by a party
entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitee") of written notice of
the assertion or the commencement of any Proceeding by a third-party with
respect to any matter referred to in Sections 7.2 or 7.3, the Indemnitee shall
give written notice thereof to the party obligated to indemnify Indemnitee
(the "Indemnitor"), and thereafter shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably
informed with respect thereto; provided, that failure of the Indemnitee to
give the Indemnitor notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced thereby. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a third-party Proceeding may be asserted by notice to the party from
whom indemnification is sought and shall be paid promptly after such notice.

 

7.5 Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided in this Agreement shall be
cumulative and shall not preclude any party from asserting any other right, or
seeking any other remedies, against the other party.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS AND ANTI-TRUST MATTERS

 

8.1 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare (or cause
to be prepared) and Purchaser shall file (or cause to be filed) the Tax Return
required to be filed by the Company for 2015, inclusive of the Closing Date
for (or that includes) a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed for
taxable years after 2015. To the extent any Tax shown as due on such Tax
Return is payable by Seller (taking into account indemnification obligations
hereunder), such Tax Return shall be provided to Seller at least sixty (60)
days prior to the due date for filing such return (or, if required to be filed
within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the
Closing Date); and Seller shall have thirty (30) days to review, and Seller
shall not file such Tax Return with respect to any information related to
periods prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
failure of Seller to notify Purchaser of changes to any such Tax Return within
thirty (30) days of receipt thereof shall constitute consent.

 

8.2 Amended Returns; Tax Elections. Except as part of a resolved audit with a
Tax authority, Seller may not amend (or permit the amendment of) a Tax Return
of the Company or make, amend or revoke (or permit the making, amendment, or
revocation of) any Tax election of the Company, in each case, with respect to
a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Except as part of a resolved audit with a Tax
authority, Purchaser may not amend (or cause the Company to amend) a Tax
Return of the Company, or amend or

   

revoke (or permit the making, amendment, or revocation of) any Tax election of
the Company, in each case, with respect to a taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller. Purchaser shall
prepare all amendments to Tax Returns of the Company after the Closing Date,
provided that the parties shall coordinate the preparation and filing of any
such amendment to the Tax Returns of the Company for periods prior to the
Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall not file any such amendment except with
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The failure of Seller to notify Purchaser
of changes to any such amendment to a Tax Return within thirty (30) days of
receipt thereof shall constitute consent.

 

8.3 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees ("Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by Seller when due. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Tax law, Seller shall, at its own expense, prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and
provide Purchaser with a copy thereof. If required by applicable Tax law,
Purchaser shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

8.4 Straddle Period Allocations. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes of the
Company incurred with respect to a taxable period that includes but does not
end on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date (i) except as provided in (ii) and (iii)
below, to the extent feasible, on a specific identification basis, according
to the date of the event or transaction giving rise to the Tax, and (ii)
except as provided in (iii) below, with respect to periodically assessed ad
valorem Taxes and Taxes not otherwise feasibly allocable to specific
transactions or events, in proportion to the number of days in such taxable
period occurring through the Closing Date compared to the total number of days
in such taxable period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the Tax which would be payable if
the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall be responsible for the Tax applicable to the period prior to
and after the Closing Date, respectively, as described in this Section 8.4.

 

8.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing and preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article VIII and any
Proceeding related thereto. Such cooperation will include the retention and
(upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such Proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller will
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute or period of limitations
of the respective Tax periods

 

8.6 Cooperation on Antitrust Laws.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, within ten (10) business days after
Execution Date, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, any HSR Filing
required of it under the HSR Act with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, which forms shall specifically request early termination of the
initial HSR Act waiting period. The parties will cooperate with one another to
the extent necessary in the preparation of any such HSR Filing. The parties
hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with each
other and use good faith, diligent efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any such issues and, consequently, the
expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting period, such good faith diligent
efforts to include counsel's undertaking: (i) to keep each other appropriately
informed of communications received from and submitted to personnel of the
reviewing antitrust authority; and (ii) to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice. The parties shall share the filing fees associated
with their HSR Filings on a 50/50 basis. Each party will be responsible for
all other costs and expenses incurred by it associated with its HSR Filing.
In respect of any HSR Filing, each of Purchaser and Seller will use its good
faith, diligent efforts to eliminate any concern on the part of any court or
governmental authority regarding the legality of the proposed transaction,
including cooperating in good faith with any government investigation and the
prompt production of documents, information, and witnesses requested in the
course of such of any such investigation, including those contained in a
Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials (as that term is
defined in the HSR Act), and to cause the closing under this Agreement to
occur as soon as practical. Nothing in this Section 8.6 shall require either
party to consent to the divestiture or other disposition of any of its or its
Affiliates' assets or to consent to any other structural or conduct remedy,
and each party and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to contest,
administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other action of the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice or any third party respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that the Effective Date has not occurred within one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Execution Date, or such date as the parties
may mutually agree, this Agreement may be terminated by either party on
written notice to the other.

   

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

9.1 Integration; Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There
are no agreements, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings with
respect to the subject matter hereof other than those expressly set forth
herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement embodies the complete
agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, that
may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 

9.2 Further Assurances. At any time or from time to time after the date
hereof, the parties agree to cooperate with each other, and at the request of
any other party, to execute and deliver any further instruments or documents
and to take all such further action as the other party may reasonably request
in order to evidence or effectuate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and to otherwise carry out the intent of the parties
hereunder.

 

9.3 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only by a written
instrument signed by the parties hereto. No waiver by any party hereto of any
provision hereof shall be effective unless set forth in a writing executed by
the party so waiving. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
any preceding or succeeding breach and no failure by either party to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of such party's
rights or privileges hereunder or shall be deemed a waiver of such party's
rights to exercise the same at any subsequent time or times hereunder.

 

9.4 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
given to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given to such
party at such party's address set forth on such party's signature page hereto
or such other address as such party may hereafter specify by notice in writing
to the other party. Any such notice or other communication shall be addressed
as aforesaid and given by (a) hand delivery, (b) reputable overnight courier
or (c) e-mail transmission. Any notice or other communication will be deemed
to have been duly given (i) on the date of service if served personally, (ii)
on the business day after delivery to an overnight courier service, provided
receipt of delivery has been confirmed, or (iii) on the date of transmission
if sent via e-mail, provided confirmation of receipt is obtained promptly
after completion of transmission.

 

9.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles that would provide for application of the law of a jurisdiction
other than New York.

 

9.6 Dispute Resolution.

 

(a) Resolution by Chief Executive Officers. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, in the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
under, out of, or in connection with this Agreement (a "Dispute"), including
as to the breach, performance, or interpretation of this Agreement or the
rights, duties or liabilities of either party hereunder, the parties will
first attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute by negotiation and
consultation between themselves. If such Dispute is not resolved on an
informal basis within ten (10) business days, either party may, by written
notice to the other party, refer the Dispute to the Chief Executive Officers
of the parties for attempted resolution by good faith negotiation within 30
days after such notice is received. Such Chief Executive Officers will
attempt in good faith to promptly resolve such Dispute. If any matter is not
resolved, or both parties believe that it will not be resolved, under the
foregoing provisions, each party may, at its sole discretion, seek resolution
of such matter in accordance with this Section 9.6.

 

(b) Arbitration. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section, if
the parties do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution pursuant to Section
9.6(a) as to a Dispute, the Dispute shall be referred for resolution by final,
binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The
arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (or any
successor entity thereto) ("AAA") under its rules of commercial arbitration
then in effect, except as modified in this Agreement. The arbitration shall
be conducted in the English language, by a single arbitrator knowledgeable in
the subject matter at issue in the Dispute and acceptable to both parties;
provided, that the parties may by mutual agreement elect to have the
arbitration conducted by a panel of three arbitrators (such single arbitrator
or panel, the "Arbitrator"). The Arbitrator shall, if appropriate, engage an
independent expert with experience in the subject matter of the Dispute to
advise the Arbitrator.

 

(i) With respect to any Dispute referred to arbitration pursuant to this
Section 9.6, the parties and the Arbitrator shall use all reasonable efforts
to complete any such arbitration within three (3) months from the issuance of
notice of a referral of any such Dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator shall
determine what discovery will be permitted, consistent with the goal of
limiting the cost and time which the parties must expend for discovery;
provided that the Arbitrator shall permit such discovery as he or she deems
necessary to permit an equitable resolution of the Dispute.

 

(ii) The decision of the Arbitrator shall be the sole, exclusive, and binding
remedy between them regarding the Dispute presented to the Arbitrator. Any
decision of the Arbitrator may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction
for judicial recognition of the decision and an order of enforcement. The
arbitration proceedings and the decision of the Arbitrator shall not be made
public without the joint consent of the parties, and each party shall maintain
the confidentiality of such proceedings and decision.

   

(iii) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration proceedings
shall be conducted in Los Angeles, California. The parties shall share
equally the cost of the arbitration filing and hearing fees, the cost of the
independent expert retained by the Arbitrator, and the cost of the Arbitrator
and administrative fees of AAA. Each party shall bear its own costs and
attorneys' and witnesses' fees and associated costs and expenses.

 

(c) Temporary Relief. Pending the selection of the Arbitrator or pending the
Arbitrator's determination of the merits of any Dispute, either Party may seek
appropriate interim or provisional relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction as necessary to protect the rights or property of that party.

 

9.7 Enforcement. Each party hereto acknowledges that money damages would not
be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the covenants or agreements in
this Agreement are not performed by the parties in accordance with its terms,
and it is therefore agreed that in addition to and without limiting any other
remedy or right each party may have, each party will have the right to an
injunction, temporary restraining order or other equitable relief in any court
of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically
the terms and provisions hereof.

 

9.8 Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations created herein may be assigned by either party, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that either party shall be free to
assign this Agreement (a) to an Affiliate of such party provided that such
party shall remain liable and responsible to the other party for the
performance and observance of all such duties and obligations by such
Affiliate, or (b) in connection with any merger, consolidation or sale of such
party or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the party that
relate to this Agreement, without the prior consent of the non-assigning
party. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors
and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Any assignment of this Agreement
in contravention of this Section 9.8 shall be null and void.

 

9.9 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be held liable or responsible to the
other party, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement,
for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement to
the extent, and for so long as, such failure or delay is caused by or results
from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, including
fire, floods, embargoes, power shortage or failure, acts of war (whether war
be declared or not), insurrections, riots, terrorism, civil commotions,
strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, acts of God, or any acts,
omissions, or delays in acting by any governmental authority or the other
party; provided such failure or delay did not arise from the negligence or
willful misconduct of the affected party.

 

9.10 Fees and Expenses. Each party shall pay it own costs and expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the fees and expenses of its advisers, accountants and legal
counsel).

 

9.11 Severability. If any part or parts of this Agreement shall be held
unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, and if
limiting such provision would make the provision valid, then such provision
shall be deemed to be construed as so limited.

 

9.12 Binding Effect. The covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement
shall apply to and bind the Parties and the heirs, legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns of the Parties.

 

9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and
delivered to the other party. In the event that any signature is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by an e-mail which contains a portable document
format (.pdf) file of an executed signature page, such signature page shall
create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose
behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such
signature page were an original thereof.

 

9.14 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

9.15 Publicity. Except as required by Law, each party agrees not to issue any
press release or public statement disclosing information relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the terms hereof without
the prior written consent of the other party not to be unreasonably withheld.
For the avoidance of doubt (and notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary), each of Purchaser and the Company, in its sole
discretion, may make disclosures relating to the development or
commercialization of the Compound, including the results of research and any
clinical trial conducted by or on behalf of Purchaser or the Company, or any
health or safety matter related to the Compound.
