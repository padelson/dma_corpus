                  (ii)   any   significant   development   in   any   regulatory
         proceedings,  governmental  complaints,  investigations or hearings (or
         communication  indicating that any may be contemplated)  involving DCT;
         and

                  (iii) any matter or event which comes to the  knowledge of DCT
         and which  makes or could make any  representation  and  warranty  made
         concerning DCT in Articles IV or V untrue or inaccurate.

         DCT  shall  keep  LASV  fully   informed  of  such  events  and  permit
representatives of LASV access to all materials prepared in connection with such
events.

         6.2 Access and Information. DCT shall give LASV and its representatives
access during normal  business hours to all the  properties,  books,  contracts,
commitments  and records of DCT so that LASV may have full  opportunity  to make
such investigation of DCT as they shall reasonably request in advance.  DCT will
furnish  LASV all  information  concerning  DCT  required  for  inclusion in any
application,  filing, statement or notice made by LASV to, or filed or joined in
by LASV with,  any  Government  Entity in connection  with this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereunder.  None of the information furnished to LASV
under  this  Section  6.3  shall,  at the date  furnished,  contain  any  untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

                                       13

fact  necessary in order to make the  statements  made therein,  in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         6.3 Confidentiality.  All information and data furnished to DCT by LASV
or any of its Subsidiaries under this Agreement,  whether furnished orally or in
writing, shall be received,  held and treated confidentially by DCT, and none of
such  information  shall be used in any manner for the benefit of DCT or for the
benefit of any business controlled by it.

         6.4 No Solicitation.  Except with respect to a Transaction  relating to
the issuance of DCT capital  stock  permitted by clause (ii) of Section 6.2, DCT
will immediately terminate any existing activities, discussions and negotiations
with third parties  concerning any possible  Alternative  Transaction  involving
DCT.  DCT will not cause or permit  its  officers,  directors,  representatives,
agents or  representatives  to,  directly or  indirectly,  knowingly  encourage,
solicit or initiate any discussions or negotiations  with any Person  concerning
any such  Alternative  Transaction.  DCT will promptly  communicate  to LASV the
terms and conditions of any proposal for any such  Alternative  Transaction that
it may receive.

         6.5 Supplemental Information.  DCT shall furnish LASV subsequent to the
Closing,  a copy of an  audited  financial  statement  as  soon as  practicable,
together  with any  information  ordinarily  prepared  in  connection  with such
financial  statements.  All  such  financial  statements  shall be  prepared  in
conformity  with  GAAP,  shall  present  fairly  in  all  material  respects  in
accordance  with GAAP,  the financial  position of DCT at the end of the periods
covered  thereby  and the  results of its  operations  for the  periods  covered
thereby,  subject  to  year-end  adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring
accruals) and the omission of explanatory footnote materials required by GAAP.

         6.6  Consummation  of  the  Merger.  DCT  shall  use  its  commercially
reasonable best efforts to perform and fulfill all conditions and obligations on
its part to be performed and fulfilled under this Agreement, to the end that the
Merger shall be consummated.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         9.1 Consents and  Approvals.  All Parties shall use their  commercially
reasonable  best  efforts  to obtain,  before  the  Closing,  all  consents  and
approvals from any Governmental  Entity or Person that are necessary or required
by any Party for the  execution  of this  Agreement or the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

         9.2  Publicity.  No Party other than LASV shall issue any press release
or public  announcement  pertaining to this Agreement,  the Merger, or any other
transactions  contemplated hereunder. LASV and DCT shall consult with each other
concerning  any such press  release or public  announcement  and shall use their
best  efforts to agree on its text  before its public  dissemination  and before
making any filings with any Governmental  Entity or national securities exchange
with respect to any such press  release or public  announcement.  In cases where
LASV and DCT are unable to agree on a press release or public announcement, LASV
will not issue it unless the  proposing  Party is  required  to do so by Law, in
which case the Party so  obligated  shall use its best efforts to provide a copy
of the press release or public announcement to the other Party before its filing
or public dissemination.

         9.3  Expenses.  LASV shall pay its own costs and  expenses  incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and DCT
shall pay its costs and  expenses  in  connection  with this  Agreement  and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby, in each case whether or not the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement are consummated.

similar Tax.

corporate name "Dynamic Chaos Technology,  Inc." in accordance with the the laws
of the State of Delaware, if available.

                                       16
<PAGE>

         As soon as  practicable  after the  closing of the Merger  contemplated
hereunder,  LASV shall amend its corporate  name to "Dynamic  Chaos  Technology,
Inc.".

         9.6 Anitrust  Filings,  etc. Each of LASV and DCT shall timely file and

                                    ARTICLE X

                             NATURE AND SURVIVAL OF
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         10.1 Nature of Statements. All, but only those, statements contained in
this  Agreement or any  Disclosure  Schedule or  certificate  delivered by or on
behalf of a Party  under  this  Agreement  shall be deemed  representations  and
warranties made by that Party in connection with the  transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement.

         10.2  Survival of  Representations  and  Warranties.  Regardless of any
investigation  made  at  any  time  by or on  behalf  of  any  Party  or of  any
information  any  Party  may have as a result  of any  such  investigation,  the
representations  and warranties made by the LASV Parties in Article III, and the
representations and warranties made by DCT in Article IV, shall not survive, and
shall terminate upon, the Closing.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         The respective indemnification obligations of the Parties are:

         11.1 Indemnification  Regarding Article IV Representations,  Warranties
and DCT  Covenants.  DCT agrees to pay and to  indemnify  and hold  harmless and
defend the LASV Parties and their  respective  Affiliates,  and their respective
successors and assigns from and against any and all Damages caused by or arising
out of or in respect of:

                                       17
<PAGE>

                  (i)   any  breach  or default in the performance by DCT of any
         covenant or agreement of DCT contained in this Agreement; and

                  (ii)  any  breach  of  warranty  or  inaccurate  or  erroneous
         representation contained in Article IV of this Agreement.

         11.2  Indemnification  by LASV. LASV agrees to pay and to indemnify and
hold harmless and defend DCT, its  shareholders  and its Affiliates (but not DCT
after the Closing), and their respective successors and assigns from and against
any and all Damages caused by or arising out of or in respect of:

                  (i)   any breach or  default in the performance by LASV of any
         covenant or agreement of LASV contained in this Agreement; and

                  (ii)  any  breach  of  warranty  or  inaccurate  or  erroneous
         representation contained in Article III of this Agreement.

         11.3  Requests  for  Indemnification.  If any  Party  (an  "Indemnified
Party") becomes aware of a fact, circumstance, claim, situation, demand or other
matter for which it or any other Indemnified Party believes it is entitled to be
indemnified  under  this  Article  XIII (any such item  being  herein  called an
"Indemnity  Matter"),  the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice of
the  Indemnity  Matter to the  Indemnifying  Party,  requesting  indemnification
therefor,  specifying the nature of and specific basis for the Indemnity  Matter
and the  amount  or  estimated  amount  thereof  to the  extent  then  feasible;
provided,  however,  a failure to give such  notice will not waive any rights of
the Indemnified Party except to the extent the rights of the Indemnifying  Party
are actually materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to assume the defense or  investigation  of such Indemnity Matter
and to retain counsel and other experts to represent the  Indemnified  Party and
shall pay the fees and  disbursements  of such  counsel  and other  experts.  If
within 30 days  after  receipt of the  request  (or five days if  litigation  is
pending) the  Indemnifying  Party fails to give notice to the Indemnified  Party
that  the  Indemnifying  Party  assumes  the  defense  or  investigation  of the
Indemnity  Matter,  an  Indemnified  Party may retain  counsel and other experts
(whose fees and disbursements shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party)
to file any motion,  answer or other  pleading  and take such other action which
the  Indemnified  Party  reasonably  deems necessary to protect its interests or
those of the  Indemnifying  Party until the date on which the Indemnified  Party
receives  such notice from the  Indemnifying  Party.  If an  Indemnifying  Party
retains counsel and other experts, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain its own  counsel  and other  experts,  but the fees and  expenses of such
counsel  and other  experts  shall be at the  expense of the  Indemnified  Party
unless (i) the  Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified  Party mutually agree to
the retention of such counsel and other experts or (ii) the named parties to any
such proceeding  (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified  Party and  representation of both parties by the same
counsel would, in the opinion of counsel retained by the Indemnifying  Party, be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

                                       18
<PAGE>

         If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate  with  the  Indemnifying  Party  and its  counsel  in  contesting  any
Indemnity  Matter which the Indemnifying  Party defends,  or, if appropriate and
related to the Indemnity Matter in question,  in making any counterclaim against
the person asserting the Indemnity  Matter, or any  cross-complaint  against any
person.  No Indemnity Matter may be settled by the Indemnified Party without the
consent  of the  Indemnifying  Party,  which  consent  will not be  unreasonably
withheld.  Unless the  Indemnifying  Party agrees in writing that the Damages to
the  Indemnified  Party  resulting from such settlement are fully covered by the
indemnities  provided  herein and that such  Damages  are fully  compensable  in
money, no Indemnity Matter may be settled without the consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably  withheld.  Except with respect to
settlements  entered  without the Indemnified  Party's  consent  pursuant to the
immediately  preceding  sentence,  to  the  extent  it is  determined  that  the
Indemnified  Party has no right under this Article XIII to be indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying
Party any amounts  previously  paid or advanced by the  Indemnifying  Party with
respect to such matters pursuant to this Article XIII.

         After the delivery of a notice of an Indemnity Matter hereunder, at the
reasonable  request of the Indemnifying  Party the Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its  representatives  full and complete access to the
books,  records and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably
related to the matters to which the notice relates.  The Indemnifying Party will
not disclose to any third person (except its  representatives)  any  information
obtained pursuant to the preceding  sentence which is designated as confidential
by the Indemnified Party and which is not otherwise  generally  available to the
public or not already within the knowledge of the Indemnifying  Party, except as
may be required by  applicable  law. The  Indemnifying  Party shall  request its
representatives  not to disclose any such information (unless already within its
knowledge  or as may be required by  applicable  law).  All such access shall be
subject to the normal safety  regulations of the Indemnified Party, and shall be
granted under conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with the business
and operations of the Indemnified Party.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         12.1  Amendment.  This  Agreement  may be  amended  only  by a  written
instrument executed by LASV and DCT.

         12.2  Waiver.  At any time on or before the Closing  Date,  each of the
Parties may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other act of any of the  other  Parties,  (ii)  waive  any  inaccuracies  in the
representations  and  warranties  made  in  this  Agreement  or in a  Disclosure
Schedule  of a Party,  (iii)  waive  compliance  with any of the  agreements  or
conditions  of this  Agreement  which  may be  legally  waived,  and (iv)  grant
consents  under this  Agreement.  Any such  extension,  waiver or grant shall be
valid only if evidenced by a written

                                       19
<PAGE>

instrument executed by the Party giving it. Any such extension,  waiver or grant
on behalf of (i) the LASV  Parties  need only be  executed  by LASV and (ii) DCT
executed by DCT.

         12.3  Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time before
the Closing by:

                  (i)the mutual consent of the Boards of Directors  of LASV  and
         DCT;

                  (ii) by the Boards of  Directors  of LASV or DCT if the Merger
         has not been  consummated on or before  February 21, 2001 (or any later
         date which may be agreed to by the mutual written consent of the Boards
         of Directors of LASV and DCT);  provided,  however,  that such right to
         terminate this  Agreement  shall not be available to any Party that has
         breached in any material  respect its obligations  under this Agreement
         in any manner that has  proximately  contributed  to the failure of the
         Merger to occur on or before such date.

         12.4  Consequences of  Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated as
provided in Section  14.3,  it shall become void and there shall be no liability
or obligation on the part of any Party or their respective officers or directors
except that the  provisions  of Sections 6.6,  7.5,  11.2,  shall survive such a
termination. Nothing in this Section 14.4 shall, however, relieve any Party from
any liability for any breach of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         13.1 Non-Business  Days. If the date on which any action (including the
delivery of notices)  to be taken under this  Agreement  falls on a day which is
not a  Business  Day,  the  action  will be deemed  timely  taken if on the next
following Business Day.

         13.2 Shareholder  Consent. By execution and delivery of this Agreement,
LASV,  as the sole  shareholder  of  Merger  Subsidiary,  hereby  approves  this

with the DBCA.
