vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 20, 2009 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Tellabs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Tellabs
Willow Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Sub_ "), and WiChorus, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively referred to
as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable the merger of Sub and the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.001 par value,
of the Company (" _Company Common Shares_ "), and each issued and outstanding
share of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company (" _Company
Preferred Shares_ ", and together with the Company Common Shares, the "
_Company Shares_ "), of which 2,428,571 shares have been designated as Series
A Preferred Stock (" _Company Series A Preferred Shares_ "), 12,428,572 shares
have been designated as Series B Preferred Stock (" _Company Series B
Preferred Shares_ "), 11,766,087 shares have been designated as Series B-1
Preferred Stock (" _Company Series B-1 Preferred Shares_ ") and 10,778,443
shares have been designated as Series C Preferred Stock (" _Company Series C
Preferred Shares_ "), not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company, will be converted into the right to receive a portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration (as defined herein);

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is advisable to and in the best interest of their
respective stockholders;

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently herewith, the directors and certain stockholders of
the Company are entering into agreements with Parent dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Support and Release Agreements_ "), in the form of the attached
_Exhibit A_ , pursuant to which, among other things, each such stockholder
has agreed to vote in favor of this Agreement and the Merger and, in the case
of certain stockholders, to certain prohibitions on competition and
solicitation; and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement,
before the Closing (as hereinafter defined), Parent, the Indemnity Agent (as
hereinafter defined) and the Stockholders Representative (as hereinafter
defined) shall enter into the Indemnity Escrow Agreement (the " _Indemnity
Agreement_ ") substantially in the form of the attached _Exhibit B_. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in
accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at
the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter
defined) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a Constituent Corporation in
the Merger; _provided_ that such substituted corporation is a Delaware
corporation which is formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no other
business activities. In such event, the parties agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
upon mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger
may provide for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than
thirty (30) days after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. When used
in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time
at which the Certificate of Merger is accepted for recording or such later
time established by the Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate
of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing.

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.4 _Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers._

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of
the Company (the " _Company Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety as
set forth in the attached _Exhibit C_. As so amended, the Company Charter
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The directors and officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the
holders of any 



 

2  securities of the Constituent Corporations:

(a) Each issued and outstanding common share, $0.001 par value, of Sub shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All Company Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any Company Shares owned by Parent
shall be canceled, and no capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to the provisions of this _Article I_ , the Company Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares to be canceled in accordance with 
_Section 1.5(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the Aggregate
Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of _Section 1.5(e)_, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 1.5(b)_) shall be converted as follows:

(i) each Company Series A Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to
receive, in cash and without interest or dividends, the greater of $0.35 (the
" _Series A Per Share Consideration_ ") and the Common Per Share
Consideration (as hereinafter defined);

(ii) each Company Series B Preferred Share shall be converted into the right
to receive, in cash and without interest or dividends, the greater of
$0.683908 (the " _Series B Per Share Consideration_ ") and the Common Per
Share Consideration;

 

(iii) each Company Series B-1 Preferred Share shall be converted into the
right to receive, in cash and without interest or dividends, the greater of
$1.27485 (the " _Series B-1 Per Share Consideration_ ") and the Common Per
Share Consideration;

(iv) each Company Series C Preferred Share shall be converted into the right
to receive, in cash and without interest or dividends, the greater of $1.67
(the " _Series C Per Share Consideration_ ") and the Common Per Share
Consideration; and

(v) each Company Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive,
in cash and without interest or dividends, the Common Share Consideration (as
hereinafter defined) divided by the aggregate number of Company Common Shares
and Company Preferred Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on a fully diluted basis (assuming the exercise of all Company
Stock Options (as hereinafter defined), excluding only the Company Unvested
Stock Options (as hereinafter defined)) (the " _Common Per
Share Consideration_ ").

Such shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive such amount.



 

3 (d) Subject to the provisions of this _Article I_ , each Company Vested Stock
Option (as hereinafter defined) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, terminated and relinquished and shall be
converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Company Common Share
subject thereto, the Common Per Share Consideration _minus_ the exercise
price thereof under such Company Vested Stock Option, subject to applicable
withholding requirements.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held
of record by any stockholder who shall not have voted such shares (or granted
his or its consent with respect to such shares) in favor of the Merger and who
shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL or, to the extent applicable, Chapter 13 of the
California Corporations Code (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration set
forth in _Section 1.5(c)_, but the holders thereof instead shall be entitled
to, and the Dissenting Shares shall only represent the right to receive,
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL or, to the extent applicable, Chapter 13 of the
California Corporations Code (the " _CCC_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) if such a holder fails to demand properly in writing from the Surviving
Corporation the appraisal of his or its shares in accordance with Section
262(d) of the DGCL or, to the extent applicable, Chapter 13 of the CCC or,
after making such demand, subsequently delivers an effective written
withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish his or its entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL or, to the extent
applicable, Chapter 13 of the CCC, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his or its

agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and
effect; no material default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the best Knowledge of the Company, by any other party exists under any

hereby will not result in the termination of, or result in a right of
termination under, any such lease. Except as disclosed in Section 3.16(a) of

will not require the consent of any party thereto or bring into operation any
other provision thereof. Except as disclosed in Section 3.16(a) of the Company

could result in the termination or reduction of the current access from the
Real Property to existing highways and road, or to sewer or other utility
services serving the Real Property. All utilities needed for the conduct of
business on the Real Property enter the Real Property through adjoining public
streets, or, if they pass through an adjoining private tract, do so in
accordance with valid easements benefiting the Real Property. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received and to the best Knowledge of
the Company and its Subsidiaries there do not exist any adverse claims to
such access that would materially adversely affect the use currently being
made of such access or utility services by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

44  with the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated January 30, 2009, between Parent
and the Company (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ ").

Section 5.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 5.7_, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid
by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

Section 5.4 _Stock Options_.

(a) Not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Vested Stock Option_ ")
held by any Company director, officer or employee to be exercised in its
entirety in accordance with the terms of such Company Stock Option and the
Company Common Shares purchased pursuant to such Company Vested Stock Option
to be issued to the holder thereof. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts so that no later than immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Vested Stock Option held by Persons who are not
directors, officers or employees of the Company shall be so exercised and the
Company Common Shares purchased pursuant thereto shall be issued to the holder
thereof.

(b) Not later than the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and not exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company Unvested Stock Option_ ") shall become and represent an unexercisable
option (the " _Substitute Option_ ") to purchase the number of shares of
common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common Shares_ ") (decreased to the nearest
full share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of Company Common Shares
subject to the Company Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Conversion Ratio (as hereinafter defined), at an
exercise price per Parent Common Share (rounded up to the nearest tenth of a
cent) equal to the exercise price per Company Common Share immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by the Conversion Ratio. Parent shall pay cash
to holders of Company Unvested Stock Options in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of Parent Common Shares upon the exercise of Substitute Options for
shares of Parent Common Shares. After the Effective Time, except as provided
above in this  _Section 5.4_, each Substitute Option shall be exercisable
upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the related
Company Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to or at the Effective Time.
It is intended that (x) each Substitute Option shall qualify following the
Effective Time as an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) to the extent the related Company Unvested Stock Option qualified as an
incentive stock option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the
conversion of the Company Unvested Stock Options into Substitute Options shall
not be treated as a modification, grant of a new option, or a change in the
form of payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and, in each case,
the provisions of this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall be applied consistently with
such intention; _provided_ , that none of Parent, Sub, the Company or any of
their respective agents, Affiliates or employees shall be deemed to have made
any representation or warranty or shall have any responsibility or liability
with respect to the Tax consequences of the conversion of the Company Stock
Options hereunder. The Company shall take all necessary action to implement 



 

45  the provisions of this _Section 5.4_. As soon as reasonably practicable,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to Parent Common Shares subject to such
Substitute Options, or shall cause such Substitute Options to be deemed to be
issued pursuant to a Parent stock plan for which shares of Parent Common
Shares have been previously registered pursuant to an appropriate
registration form.

(c) For purposes of this _Section 5.4_, the " _Conversion Ratio_ " shall be
a ratio, the numerator of which is the Common Per Share Consideration, and the
denominator of which is the closing price of a Parent Common Share on The
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC for the five (5) consecutive trading days
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.5 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

hereof.

Gains Taxes, payable in connection with the consummation of the Merger. The
Company and Parent agree to cooperate with the other in the filing of any
returns with respect to the Gains Taxes, including supplying in a timely
manner a complete list of all real property interests held by the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries and any information with respect to such property that

to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Parent of any change
or event which would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on

defined) is given in accordance with the requirements of _Section 8.4_ on or
prior to the date such indemnification obligation would otherwise terminate
in accordance with this _Section 8.2_, as to which the indemnification
obligation hereunder shall continue until the liability to be satisfied from
the Indemnity Fund shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_

indemnification obligations under this _Article VIII_  and reimbursement of
the Parent Group Members of Losses and Expenses payable in respect thereof

of the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder. Such
Indemnity Fund Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent
then known) the Loss or Expense and the method of computation of such Loss or
Expense and contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such Loss or Expense shall have occurred. The Indemnity Fund
Claim Notice shall be attached to a written notice delivered by Parent to the
Indemnity Agent (the " _Parent Claim Notice_ ").

(b) Unless the Stockholders Representative shall have delivered an Indemnity
Fund Objection (as hereinafter defined) to Parent and the Indemnity Agent in
accordance with _Section 8.4(c)_, the Indemnity Agent shall, on the thirtieth
(30th) day (or such earlier day as Parent and the Stockholders Representative
shall authorize in writing to the Indemnity Agent) after receipt of a Parent
Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount, deliver
to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member as

(c) Until the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery of the Parent Claim
Notice to the Indemnity Agent, the Stockholders Representative may deliver to
the Indemnity Agent and Parent a written objection (an " _Indemnity Fund

Indemnity Fund Objection to Parent and the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy
of such Indemnity Fund Objection shall be delivered to the Claiming Party.

(d) Upon receipt of an Indemnity Fund Objection properly made, the Indemnity
Agent shall (i) deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each

Representative and (ii) designate in the Indemnity Fund a portion thereof,
valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the
amount subject to the Indemnity Fund Claim Notice which is disputed by the
Stockholders Representative. Thereafter, the Indemnity Agent shall not
dispose of such designated portion of the Indemnity Fund until the Indemnity
Agent shall have received a certified copy of the final decision of the
arbitrators as contemplated by _Section 8.6_, or the Indemnity Agent
shall have received a copy of the written agreement between Parent and the
Stockholders Representative resolving such dispute and setting forth the
amount, if any, which the Claiming Party is entitled to receive. The Indemnity
Agent will deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each
Parent Group Member entitled to payment, such portion of the Indemnity Fund,
valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the
amount that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as set forth in the
arbitration decision after the expiration of ten (10) business days from the
receipt of such decision or, in the event that the amount to which the
Claiming Party is entitled is established pursuant to an agreement between
the Parent and the Stockholders Representative (and the Claiming Party, if
applicable), promptly after the Indemnity AgentÂ’s receipt of such agreement.

Section 8.5 _Notice and Determination of Stockholder Claims_.

(a) If the Claiming Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification to be
satisfied from Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_, such Claiming Party shall so notify each
Company Stockholder and Company Vested Stock Optionholder from whom it is
seeking indemnification (the " _Affected Stockholder_ ") in writing (the "
_Stockholder Claim Notice_ ", and together the Indemnity Fund Notice, the "
_Claim Notices_ ", and each a " _Claim Notice_ ") of the facts giving rise to
such claim for indemnification hereunder. Such Stockholder Claim Notice shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known) the Loss or Expense
and the method of computation of such Loss or Expense and contain a reference
to the Specified Representation in respect of which such Loss or Expense
shall have occurred. If the Claiming Party is not Parent, the Stockholder
Claim Notice must be accompanied by a certificate from Parent confirming that
the Claiming Party is a Parent Group Member.

(b) Unless the Affected Stockholder shall have delivered a Stockholder
Objection in accordance with  _Section 8.5(c)_, the Affected Stockholder
shall, on the thirtieth (30th) day (or such earlier day as the Affected
Stockholder may determine) after receipt of a Stockholder Claim Notice with
respect to indemnification for a specified amount, deliver to Parent, for
its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the
Stockholder Claim Notice, payment of the specified amount in cash via check
made payable to Parent or wire transfer to an account to be designated by
Parent.

Notice, the Affected Stockholder may deliver to the Claiming Party a written
objection (a " _Stockholder Objection_ ", together with the Indemnity Fund
Objection, the " _Objections_ ", and each an " _Objection_ ") to the claim
made in such Stockholder Claim Notice. 

(d) Upon receipt of a Stockholder Objection properly made, the Affected 



 

57  Stockholder shall deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of
each Parent Group Member named in the Stockholder Claim Notice, such portion
of the specified indemnification amount, if any, which is not disputed by the
Affected Stockholder. Thereafter, after the expiration of ten (10) business
days from the receipt of a certified copy of the final decision of the
arbitrators as contemplated by _Section 8.6_ setting forth the amount, if
any, which such Claiming Party is entitled to receive, or promptly upon the
completion of the memorandum setting forth the agreement of the Claiming Party
and the Affected Stockholder as contemplated by _Section 8.6_ and the
specified amount, if any, that the Claiming Party shall be entitled to
receive, the Affected Stockholder shall deliver to Parent, for its account or
for the account of each Parent Group Member entitled to payment, the specified
amount in cash via check made payable to Parent or wire transfer to an
account to be designated by Parent.

Section 8.6  _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

(a) For claims made pursuant to _Section 8.4_, the Claiming Party shall
deliver a written response to the Stockholders Representative in respect of
any Indemnity Fund Objection properly delivered by the Stockholders
Representative. If after twenty (20) days following delivery of such response
there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Stockholders Representative and
the Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
If the Stockholders Representative and the Claiming Party should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both,
and shall be furnished to the Indemnity Agent. The Indemnity Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the applicable
portion of Indemnity Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
the Claiming Party or the Stockholders Representative may, by written notice
to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss
or Expense is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15)
days after such written notice is sent, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as
to the validity and amount of any claim submitted thereto shall be binding,
and conclusive on Parent, the Stockholders Representative, the Company
Stockholders and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders, including with
respect to claims for indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.6_, the Indemnity Agent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments
out of the Indemnity Fund in accordance therewith.

(c) For claims made pursuant to _Section 8.5_, the Claiming Party shall
deliver a written response to the Affected Stockholder in respect of any
Stockholder Objection properly delivered by the Affected Stockholder. If after
twenty (20) days following delivery of such response there remains a dispute
as to any claims, the Affected Stockholder and the Claiming Party shall
attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Affected
Stockholder and the Claiming Party should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by 



 

58  both and the Affected Stockholder shall pay the agreed upon amount to the
Claiming Party.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, the
Claiming Party may, by written notice to the Affected Stockholder, demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss or Expense is at
issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree
to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled
by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. The Claiming Party may include
in such arbitration some or all of the other Affected Stockholders to which
any Claiming Party shall have submitted Claim Notices. The arbitrators shall
be the same persons who shall have served or are serving as arbitrators
pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_, provided, that if arbitrators shall have not
been appointed pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_ or any of them is unwilling or
unable to so serve, then within fifteen (15) days after such written notice
is sent, Parent and a majority of the Affected Stockholders shall each select
one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of
any claim submitted thereto shall be binding, and conclusive on Parent, the
Company Stockholders and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders.

(e) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles,
California under the commercial rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay
its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees
and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

Section 8.7 _Stockholders Representative_.

(a) The " _Stockholders Representative_ " shall be Thomas Dyal, who may be
replaced by the Company prior to the Effective Time. The Stockholders
Representative shall be constituted and appointed as agent and attorney-in-

Vested Stock Optionholders receiving consideration pursuant to _Article I_.
The Stockholders Representative shall have full power and authority to
represent all such Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock
Optionholders and their respective successors with respect to all matters
arising under this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement and all actions taken
by the Stockholders Representative hereunder and thereunder shall be binding

their respective successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by each of them. The Stockholders Representative shall take any and all
actions which it believes is necessary or appropriate under this Agreement
and the Indemnity Agreement for and on behalf of such Company Stockholders and
Company Vested Stock Optionholders, as fully as if the Company Stockholders
and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders were acting on their own behalf,
including, without limitation, defending all indemnity claims pursuant to
_Section 8.2_, consenting to, compromising or settling all such indemnity
claims, conducting negotiations with Parent and the Indemnity Agent under
this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement, taking any and all other actions
specified in or contemplated by this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement,
and engaging counsel, accountants or other Stockholders Representatives in
connection with the foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Stockholders 



 

59  Representative shall have full power and authority to interpret all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement and to
consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all such Company
Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders and such successors. The
Person designated to serve as the Stockholders Representative may be changed
by the holders of a majority in interest of the Indemnity Fund from time to
time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders
Representative shall receive no compensation for services. Any expenses
incurred by the Stockholders Representative in connection with its services
hereunder shall be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund upon presentation of
appropriate expense documentation as and to the extent expressly provided in
the Indemnity Agreement. 

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to the Company
Stockholders or the Company Vested Stock Optionholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder or under the Indemnity Agreement as Stockholders
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the written advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company
Stockholders and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders shall severally
indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold it harmless from and
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance and administration of its duties hereunder.

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall treat confidentially and not
disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially).

Section 8.8  _Actions of the Stockholders Representative_. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative shall constitute a
decision of all Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders to
whom funds otherwise payable are deposited in the Indemnity Fund and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Company Stockholder and Company
Vested Stock Optionholder, and the Indemnity Agent and Parent may rely upon
any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Company Stockholder and Company Vested Stock Optionholder. The Indemnity Agent
and each Parent Group Member are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative.

Section 8.9 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent determines to make a
demand against the Indemnity Fund with respect to a third party claim, Parent
shall notify the Stockholders Representative of such claim, and the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate
in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent
may not effect the settlement of any such claims without the consent of the
Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
In the event that the Stockholders Representative has consented to any such
settlement, the Stockholders Representative shall have no power or authority
to object under _Sections 8.4_ or _8.5_ or any other provision of this
_Article VIII_ to the amount paid in such settlement.

in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to (i) each

"), Stockholder will not directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent,
independent contractor, partner, member, manager, officer, director
or otherwise) (A) own or make any investment in a company or business with
products or services substantially similar to or competitive with the packet
core products and services of the Company (the " _Packet Core Business_ ") or
the business unit of any successor company that includes the CompanyÂ’s Packet
Core Business, or (B) manage, operate, control, participate in or perform
services for any division or department of a company or business, or the
division or department of an affiliate or subsidiary of such company or
business, if such division or department is engaged in the Packet Core
Business (collectively, a " _Competitive Division_ "); provided, however,
that, subject to clause (i)(A) above, this clause (i)(B) will not prevent
Stockholder from managing, operating, participating in or performing services
for (whether as employee, agent, independent contractor, manager or officer)
non-Competitive Divisions of such company or business, but only if
Stockholder has no direct or indirect involvement whatsoever in any aspect of
the Competitive Divisions of such company or business; and

(ii) that during the Noncompetition Period, Stockholder will not induce or
attempt to persuade any employee, agent, licensor, content provider,
supplier, distributor or customer of the Packet Core Business to terminate
such employment, agency or business relationship in order to enter into any
such relationship on behalf of any other business organization; provided,
however, that general advertisements and job listings disseminated to the
public at large will not be deemed to constitute a "solicitation" of employees
pursuant to the foregoing provision.

In the event StockholderÂ’s employment is involuntarily terminated by the
Company without Cause or Stockholder voluntarily terminates his employment
from the Company with Good Reason and Stockholder does not at any time prior
to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period breach this Agreement or any
proprietary information, inventions or similar agreement between Stockholder
and the Company or Parent, the Company will continue to pay StockholderÂ’s
base salary, as in effect immediately prior to such termination, for the
remainder of the Noncompetition Period; provided that the CompanyÂ’s obligation
to make such payments shall cease if Parent, in its sole discretion, provides
Stockholder with written notice that it has elected to waive the restrictions
hereunder. If Stockholder is a "specified employee," as defined in Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), as of
the date of StockholderÂ’s separation from service, then to the extent any
amount payable to Stockholder hereunder (i) constitutes the payment of
nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code, and (ii) under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the
six-month anniversary of StockholderÂ’s separation from service, such payment
shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (a) the six-month anniversary
of StockholderÂ’s separation from service and (b) the date of StockholderÂ’s
death.

For purposes of this Section 1(f), " _Cause_ " means StockholderÂ’s (A)
commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, theft,
dishonesty or a criminal act constituting 



 

A-3  a felony under federal or state law, (B) breach of or willful failure to
perform any material covenants under a proprietary information and inventions
agreement with the Company or its affiliates, (C) repeated refusal to perform
the duties assigned by the Company or any of its affiliates, provided such
duties are reasonably consistent with StockholderÂ’s employment position, (D)
gross negligence or willful misconduct resulting in a material loss to the
Company or any of its affiliates, or damage to the reputation of the Company
or any of its affiliates, (E) material violation of the employment policies of
the Company or any of its affiliates or (F) violation of any statutory or
common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any of its affiliates.

For purposes of this Section 1(f), " _Good Reason_ " shall exist upon the
occurrence, without StockholderÂ’s express written consent, of any of the
following events: (A) a material diminution in StockholderÂ’s position,
authority or duties (including the assignment to Stockholder of any duties
materially and adversely inconsistent with StockholderÂ’s position, authority
or duties hereunder) as in effect immediately following the Effective Time;
(B) a reduction of more than 5% (other than pursuant to a uniform reduction
applicable to other similarly situated employees of the Company) in the base
salary of Stockholder; or (C) relocation of the CompanyÂ’s business office to
any location more than 30 miles from its location as of the Effective Time;
provided, however, that the occurrence of any such event shall not constitute
Good Reason unless Stockholder provides written notice to StockholderÂ’s direct
supervisor or the senior human resources representative of Parent of the
existence of such event not later than 90 days after the initial existence of
such event, and the Company shall have failed to remedy such event within 30
days after receipt of such notice.

Nothing contained in this paragraph shall limit or otherwise affect any
obligation of Stockholder under any employment agreement, including any
proprietary information, inventions or similar agreement, entered into with
the Company or Parent. In addition, nothing contained herein shall limit or
otherwise affect the ability of Stockholder to own not more than 1% of the
outstanding capital stock of any entity that is engaged in the Packet Core
Business provided that either such investment is a passive investment in a
publicly traded company or Stockholder receives such stock pursuant to one or
more equity-based compensation awards granted solely in connection with his
services for a non-Competitive Division and Stockholder is not directly or
indirectly involved in the management or operation of such business or
otherwise providing consulting services to such business, except to the
extent Stockholder is permitted to perform services for a non-Competitive
Division, as set forth above.]1

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Stockholder will duly exercise any
Company Vested Stock Options held by such Stockholder in accordance with its
terms.

(h) The Stockholder will not exercise any dissentersÂ’ rights or rights of
appraisal under applicable law with respect to the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

expenses and compensation of every kind and nature whatsoever, past, present
or future, at law or in equity, whether known or unknown, contingent or
otherwise, which the Stockholder had, have, or may have had at any time in the
past until and including the Effective Time against the Released Parties, or
any of them, which relate to or arise out of the StockholderÂ’s
prior relationship with the Company or its rights or status as a stockholder
of the Company, in each case except (i) as expressly provided in this
Agreement, (ii) as expressly provided in the Merger Agreement (including the
rights of indemnification contained in Section 8.10 thereof), and (iii) the
undersignedÂ’s right to receive unpaid wages or accrued benefits as of the date
hereof in connection with his employment, if any, by the Company.

3\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Stockholder represents and warrants
to Parent as follows:

(a) The Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good title
to, the Subject Shares. The Stockholder does not own, of record or
beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the
Subject Shares. The Stockholder has the sole right to vote, and the sole power
of disposition with respect to, the Subject Shares, and except for

page hereof.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the
Stockholder enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may affect the
enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general equitable
principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder
does not and will not conflict with any agreement, order or other instrument
binding upon the Stockholder, nor require the Stockholder to make or obtain
any regulatory filing or approval.

(c) The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that it may hereafter
discover facts and legal theories concerning this Agreement (including without
limitation Section 2) and the subject matter hereof in addition to or
different from those which it now believes to be true. The Stockholder
understands and hereby agrees that this Agreement (including without
limitation, Section 2) shall remain effective in all respects notwithstanding
those additional or different facts and legal theories or the discovery of
those additional or different facts or legal theories. The Stockholder assumes
the risk of 



 

A-5  any mistake of fact or law with regard to any potential claim or with regard
to any of the facts which are now unknown to it relating thereto. Further, in
entering into this Agreement, the Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that it
is not relying upon any information provided by Parent or Sub in connection
with the provisions of this Agreement.

4\. _Termination_. The obligations of the Stockholder hereunder shall
terminate in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.1 thereof. This Agreement shall continue in effect and survive after the
Effective Time. No termination of this Agreement shall relieve the Stockholder
from any liability in connection with this Agreement incurred prior to such
termination.

5\. _Further Assurances_. The Stockholder will, from time to time, execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further
consents, documents and other instruments as Parent may reasonably request for
the purpose of effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6\. _Successors, Assigns and Transferees Bound_. Any successor, assignee or
transferee (including a successor, assignee or transferee as a result of the
death of the Stockholder, such as an executor or heir) shall be bound by the
terms hereof, and the Stockholder shall take any and all actions necessary to
obtain the written confirmation from such successor, assignee or
transferee that it is bound by the terms hereof.

7\. _Remedies_. The Stockholder acknowledges that money damages would be
both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement
by it and that any such breach would cause Parent irreparable harm.
Accordingly, the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement, Parent, in addition to any other
remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance.

8\. _Severability_. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, it is the intent and understanding of each party hereto that if,
in any action before any court or tribunal legally empowered to enforce this
Agreement, any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this Agreement is
found to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such
term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency.

9\. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written
instrument executed and delivered by both the Stockholder and Parent.

10\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

11\. _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are
not defined herein shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

12\. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section or an Article, such reference shall be to a Section or an Article of
this Agreement unless 



 

A-6  otherwise indicated. The section headings contained in Indemnity Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of Indemnity Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neutral genders of such term.

13\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

14\. _No Limitation on Actions of the Stockholder as Director_. In the event
the Stockholder is a director of the Company, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to require the Stockholder to take or in any way limit any action
that the Stockholder may take to discharge the StockholderÂ’s fiduciary duties
as a director of the Company.

between or among the Parties related in any way to this Indemnity Agreement
(including but not limited to the Merger Agreement), it being specifically
understood that the following provisions are accepted by the Parties and the

which may arise out of any action taken or omitted by the Indemnity Agent in

hereof. The Indemnity AgentÂ’s right to indemnification shall survive the
termination of this Indemnity Agreement and removal or resignation of the

compromise any such claim to which it shall be entitled to indemnification
without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

     | b. | The Indemnity Agent shall not be liable to any person by
reason of any error of judgment or for any act done or step taken or omitted
by it, or for any mistake of fact or law or anything which it may do or
refrain from doing in connection herewith unless caused by or arising out of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
---|---|--- 


     | c. | The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall
be protected in acting in reliance upon, any instructions or directions
furnished to it in writing signed by both Parent and the then Stockholders
Representative pursuant to any provision of this Indemnity Agreement and shall
be entitled to treat as genuine, and as the document it purports to be, any
letter, paper or other document furnished to it or attached thereto and
believed by the Indemnity Agent to be genuine and to have been signed and
presented by the proper Party or Parties. In performing its obligations
hereunder, the Indemnity Agent may consult with counsel to the Indemnity Agent
and shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be protected in acting in
reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such counsel.

     | d. | The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to its customary fee
for the performance of services by the Indemnity Agent hereunder for each year
or portion thereof that any portion of the Indemnity Fund remains in escrow
and shall be reimbursed for reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in

expenses are hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnity Agent Â’s
Compensation_"). The Indemnity Agent shall render statements to Parent setting
forth in detail the Indemnity AgentÂ’s Compensation and the basis upon which
the Indemnity AgentÂ’s Compensation was computed. The Indemnity AgentÂ’s

Compensation is not paid by Parent, the foregoing shall be paid from the
Indemnity Fund after written notice from the Indemnity Agent to Parent.
Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund for fifty

notice to Parent and the Stockholders Representative; provided that such

Agent has been appointed and accepts such position pursuant to the terms of
this Section 7\. In such event, Parent and the Stockholders Representative
shall appoint a successor Indemnity Agent or, if Parent and the Stockholders
Representative are unable to agree upon a successor Indemnity Agent within
thirty (30) days after  

---|---|--- 



 

B-6  such notice, the Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Indemnity Agent.
Such appointment, whether by Parent and the Stockholders Representative, on
the one hand, or such court, on the other hand, shall be effective on the
effective date of the aforesaid resignation (the " _Indemnity Transfer Date_
"). The Indemnity AgentÂ’s sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day
notice period expires shall be to hold the Indemnity Fund (without any
obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated
successor indemnity agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a
final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of
delivery Indemnity AgentÂ’s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. On
the Indemnity Transfer Date, all right title and interest to the Indemnity
Fund, including interest thereon, shall be transferred to the successor
Indemnity Agent and this Indemnity Agreement shall be assigned by the
Indemnity Agent to such successor Indemnity Agent, and thereafter, the
resigning Indemnity Agent shall be released from any further obligations
hereunder. 

---|--- 



     | f. | The Indemnity Agent shall not have any right, claim or
interest in any portion of the Indemnity Fund except in its capacity as
Indemnity Agent hereunder.  
---|---|--- 



     | g. | It is understood and agreed that in the event any
disagreement among Parent and the Stockholders Representative results in
adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Indemnity Fund,
or in the event the Indemnity Agent in good faith is in doubt as to what
action it should take hereunder, the Indemnity Agent shall retain the
Indemnity Fund until the Indemnity Agent shall have received (i) an
enforceable final order of a court of competent jurisdiction which is not
subject to further appeal directing delivery of the Indemnity Fund or (ii) a
written agreement executed by Parent and the Stockholders
Representative directing delivery of the Indemnity Fund, in which event
Indemnity Agent shall disburse the Indemnity Fund in accordance with such
order or agreement. Any court order referred to in clause (i) immediately
above shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of counsel for the presenting
party satisfactory to the Indemnity Agent to the effect that said court order
or judgment is final and enforceable and is not subject to further appeal. The
Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any
dispute without making the Indemnity Agent a party to the same. The Indemnity
Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinion without further
question. 
---|---|--- 


     | h. | In no event shall the Indemnity Agent be liable in connection
with this Indemnity Agreement for any special, indirect or consequential loss
or damage of any kind whatsoever, even if the Indemnity Agent has been
previously advised of such loss or damage. 
---|---|--- 



     | i. |

In the event that any escrow property shall be attached, garnished or levied
upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined
by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or
entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this
Indemnity Agreement, the Indemnity Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in
its sole discretion, to obey and  

---|---|--- 



 

B-7  comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with
or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Indemnity Agent obeys or
complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of
the Parties hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by
reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated. 

---|--- 

Section 8\. _Stockholders Representative_.



     | a. | Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders
Representative shall act as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of
each of the Company Stockholders and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders
receiving consideration pursuant to Article I of the Merger Agreement. The
Stockholders Representative shall have full power and authority to represent
all of such Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders and
their respective successors with respect to all matters arising under this
Indemnity Agreement and the Merger Agreement and all actions taken by the
Stockholders Representative hereunder and thereunder shall be binding upon
all such Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders and such
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
The Stockholders Representative shall take any and all actions which it
believes are necessary or appropriate under this Indemnity Agreement and the
Merger Agreement for and on behalf of such Company Stockholders and Company
Vested Stock Optionholders, as fully as if such Company Stockholders and
Company Vested Stock Optionholders were acting on their own behalf,
including, without limitation, defending all indemnity claims pursuant to
Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement, consenting to, compromising or settling
all such indemnity claims, conducting negotiations with Parent and
the Indemnity Agent under this Indemnity Agreement and the Merger Agreement,
taking any and all other actions specified in or contemplated by this
Indemnity Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and engaging counsel,
accountants or other Stockholders Representatives in connection with the
foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholders Representative shall have full power and authority to interpret
all the terms and provisions of this Indemnity Agreement and the Merger
Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all
such Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders and such
successors. The person designated to be Stockholders Representative may be
changed in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. |

From time to time between the date hereof and six (6) days prior to the
Distribution Date, the Stockholders Representative may deliver notice to the
Indemnity Agent and Parent setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of
the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with its duties under the Merger Agreement and
hereunder, in each case to the extent such expenses shall not have been
reimbursed out of the  

---|---|--- 



 

B-8  Indemnity Fund. Promptly following the Indemnity AgentÂ’s receipt of such
notice, it shall transfer to the Stockholders Representative from amounts
available in the Indemnity Fund the amount set forth in such notice;
_provided_ , that the Indemnity Agent may not transfer more than $250,000 in
the aggregate pursuant to this Section 8(b). 

---|--- 


     | c. | At least five (5) days prior to the Distribution Date, the
Stockholders Representative shall deliver notice to the Indemnity Agent and
Parent setting forth the amount of the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Stockholders Representative in connection with its duties
under the Merger Agreement and hereunder, but only to the extent such expenses
shall not have been reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund. Such expenses shall
be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund in accordance with the provision of
Section 5(b) hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Neither Parent, any Parent Group Member nor the Indemnity
Agent shall be responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of the
Stockholders Representative in such Stockholders RepresentativeÂ’s capacity as
such. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders and
Company Vested Stock Optionholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon each such Company Stockholder and Company Vested Stock Optionholder, and
the Indemnity Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such Company Stockholder and Company
Vested Stock Optionholder. The Indemnity Agent and each Parent Group Member
are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by
them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Representative. 
---|---|--- 

Section 9\. _Taxes_.

All dividends, distributions, interest and gains earned or realized on the
Indemnity Fund (" _Earnings_ ") shall be treated as having been received by
the Company Stockholders and the Company Vested Stock Optionholders and
reported, as and to the extent required by law, by the Indemnity Agent to the
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), or any other taxing authority, on IRS
Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the
Indemnity Fund by the Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock

the Company Stockholders and Company Vested Stock Optionholders to provide to
the Indemnity Agent all forms and information necessary to complete such
information returns and payee statements. In the event the Indemnity Agent
becomes liable for the payment of taxes, including withholding taxes, relating
to Earnings or any payment made hereunder, the Indemnity Agent may deduct

taxes it deems appropriate, including but not limited to 



 

B-9  required withholding in the absence of proper tax documentation, and shall
remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

corporation in the event of a merger, consolidation or transfer or sale of all
or substantially all of ParentÂ’s stock or assets and that the Indemnity Agent
may assign its rights hereunder to a successor Indemnity Agent appointed

communications delivered to the Indemnity Agent, such communications shall be
deemed to have been received on the date received by an officer of the
Indemnity Agent or any employee of the Indemnity Agent who reports directly

Section 14\. _Governing Law_. 

This Indemnity Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws (as opposed to conflicts of law provisions) of the State of
Illinois.

Section 15\. _Counterparts_.

This Indemnity Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

Section 16\. _Interpretation_.

When a reference is made in this Indemnity Agreement to a Section or Annex,
such reference shall be to a Section of, or Annex attached to, this Indemnity
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The Annexes referred to herein shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Indemnity Agreement to the same
extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. The section
headings contained in this Indemnity Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Indemnity Agreement. For 



 

B-12  purposes of this Indemnity Agreement, (i) the words "include," "includes" or
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation",
and (ii) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby,", "hereto" and "hereunder"
refer to this Indemnity Agreement as a whole. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neutral genders
of such term.

Section 17\. _Partial Invalidity_.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Indemnity Agreement, it
is the intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action
before any court or tribunal legally empowered to enforce this Indemnity
Agreement, any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this Indemnity
Agreement is found to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then
such term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency.

Section 18\. _Entire Agreement; Modification and Waiver_.

This Indemnity Agreement and the Merger Agreement embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Indemnity Agent and the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the parties hereto acknowledge that the Indemnity Agent is
not a party to nor is it bound by the Merger Agreement. No
amendment, modification or waiver of this Indemnity Agreement shall be
binding or effective for any purpose unless it is made in a writing signed by
the Party against whom enforcement of such amendment, modification or waiver
is sought and acknowledged and accepted by the Indemnity Agent. No course of
dealing between the parties to this Indemnity Agreement shall be deemed to
affect or to modify, amend or discharge any provision or term of this
Indemnity Agreement. No delay by any party to or any beneficiary of this
Indemnity Agreement in the exercise of any of its rights or remedies shall
operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any party to
or any beneficiary of this Indemnity Agreement of any such right or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof. No party to this
Indemnity Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if it
is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Indemnity
Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes,
electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes
reasonably beyond its control. A waiver of any right or remedy on any one
occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right or
remedy on any other occasion.

Section 19\. _Security Procedures_.

a. In the event funds transfer instructions are given, whether in writing, by
facsimile or otherwise, the Indemnity Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Annex B, and the Indemnity Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated.
The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a
writing actually received and acknowledged by the Indemnity Agent. If the
Indemnity Agent is unable to contact 



 

B-13  any of the authorized representatives identified in Annex B, no funds shall
be wired until such confirmation can be accomplished as set forth in this
Section 19(a). The Indemnity Agent and the beneficiaryÂ’s bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Parent or Stockholders Representative to identify (a) the
beneficiary, (b) the beneficiaryÂ’s bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. The
Indemnity Agent may apply any of the Indemnity Funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiaryÂ’s bank or an intermediary bank designated. The
Parties acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially
reasonable.

b. Parent acknowledges that repetitive funds transfer instructions may be
given to the Indemnity Agent for one or more beneficiaries where only the
date of the requested transfer, the amount of funds to be transferred, and/or
the description of the payment shall change within the repetitive instructions
(" _Standing Settlement Instructions_ "). Accordingly, Parent shall deliver
to the Indemnity Agent such specific Standing Settlement Instructions only for
each respective beneficiary as set forth in Annex B to this Indemnity
Agreement, by facsimile or other written instruction. The Indemnity Agent may
rely solely upon such Standing Settlement Instructions and all identifying
information set forth therein for each beneficiary. The Indemnity Agent and
Parent agree that such Standing Settlement Instructions shall be effective as
the funds transfer instructions of Parent, without requiring a verifying
callback, whether or not authorized, if such Standing Settlement Instructions
are consistent with previously authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions
for that beneficiary. Parent acknowledges that such Standing Settlement
Instructions are a security procedure and are commercially reasonable.

Section 20\. _Patriot Act Disclosure_. 

Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA
PATRIOT Act_ ") requires the Indemnity Agent to implement reasonable
procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new account with
it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT
Act and the Indemnity AgentÂ’s identity verification procedures require the
Indemnity Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm the Parties
identity including without limitation name, address and organizational
documents ("identifying information"). The Parties agree to provide the
Indemnity Agent with and consent to the Indemnity Agent obtaining from third
parties any such identifying information required as a condition of opening
an account with or using any service provided by the Indemnity Agent.

[ _Date_ ]

Tellabs, Inc.

1415 West Diehl Road

Naperville, Illinois 60560

Re: WiChorus, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 20,
2009 (the " _Agreement_ "), by and among Tellabs, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Tellabs Willow Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ ") and WiChorus, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), providing for, among other things,
the merger of Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the
merger and becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
(the "Merger"). This opinion letter is delivered to Parent pursuant to
Section 1.15(d)(v) of the Agreement, and all capitalized terms used herein
have the meanings defined for them in the Agreement unless otherwise defined
herein. Reference in this opinion letter to the Agreement excludes any
schedule (other than the Disclosure Schedule) or substantive agreement
attached as an exhibit to the Agreement, unless otherwise indicated herein. As
used herein, " _Transaction Documents_ " means the Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger.

We have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the negotiation,
preparation and execution of the Agreement. As such counsel, we have made such
legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed advisable or
necessary for the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth herein. In
addition, we have received and reviewed originals or copies of such
agreements, instruments, corporate records of the Company, certificates of
public officials, one or more certificates of the Company as to factual
matters and such other documents that we consider necessary or advisable for
the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth herein. We have not
independently established the facts stated in any of the foregoing. In such
examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals
and the conformity to original documents of all copies submitted to us. In
making our examination of documents, we have assumed that each party to any
such document (other than the Company) has satisfied those requirements that
are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such document a valid and
binding obligation of such party, enforceable against such party in accordance
with its terms. 

As used in the opinions or statements set forth below, the expressions "to our
knowledge," "known to us" or similar language with reference to matters of
fact refer to the 



 

D-1  current actual knowledge of the attorneys of this firm who have rendered
legal services in connection with the representation described in the second
paragraph of this opinion letter. Except to the extent expressly set forth
herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the
existence or absence of any fact, and no inference as to our knowledge of the
existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of
the Company or the rendering of the opinions set forth herein.

We have assumed that (i) the representations and warranties as to factual
matters made by the parties to the Agreement and pursuant thereto are correct,
(ii) corporate records of the Company are complete and accurate, (iii)
certificates of public officials or the Company that we have received and
reviewed in connection with rendering the opinions set forth herein are
accurate; and (iv) the parties to the Agreement have complied and will comply
with their obligations under the Agreement.

We are members of the Bar of the State of California and we express no opinion
as to any matter relating to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of California. We note that
the parties to the Agreement have designated the laws of the Delaware as the
laws governing the Agreement. The opinion in paragraph 3 below as to the
validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Agreement is based solely
upon the result that would be obtained if a California court were to apply the
internal laws of the State of California (excluding conflicts of law
principles) to the interpretation and enforcement of the Agreement.

In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 1 below, we have relied
solely upon a copy of the certificate of incorporation of the Company
certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and certificates
from the Secretary of State and Franchise Tax Board of the State of
California.

In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 5 below, we have relied
solely upon a review of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company, minute books relating to meetings and written actions of the board of
directors and stockholders of the Company, stock records of the Company, the
relevant financing transaction documents and statements in a certificate
executed by an officer of the Company relating to the capitalization of the
Company, including a statement to the effect that the Company has received
consideration in the amount and in the form specified by the board of
directors for all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company.

The opinions hereinafter expressed are subject to the following additional
qualifications and assumptions:

(a) We express no opinion as to the effect of applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar federal or state laws
affecting the rights of creditors;

(b) We express no opinion as to the effect of general principles of equity,
including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing, and the possible unavailability of specific
performance or injunctive relief, regardless of 



 

D-2  whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

(c) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of the
Agreement (i) purporting to waive broadly or vaguely stated rights, unknown
future defenses, rights to damages, rights to jury trials, any statute of
limitations for a period in excess of four years beyond the statutory period
or the benefits of other statutory, regulatory or constitutional rights that
cannot be waived or, if they can be waived, cannot be waived prospectively;
(ii) providing for a choice of venue; (iii) imposing penalties, forfeitures
or liquidated damages; or (iv) prescribing or varying rules of evidence,
method or quantum of proof or other legal standards in a manner contrary to
applicable statutes and rules of law;

(d) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the choice of law
provisions of the Transaction Documents;

(e) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the Support and Release
Agreement or any other provisions in the Transaction Documents concerning the
voting of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock;

(f) We express no opinion as to the effect of California Business and
Professions Code 16600 et seq. as to the enforceability of any non-competition
provision in the Transaction Documents; and

(g) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of indemnification and
contribution provisions to the extent they may be subject to limitations of
public policy and the effect of applicable statutes and rules of law.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and except as set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule, we are of the opinion that:

1\. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
the State of California.

2\. The Company has the requisite corporate power to carry on its business as
currently being conducted, and to execute and deliver each of the Transaction
Documents, to perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Merger).

3\. The execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents, the
performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents (including the Merger), have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and its stockholders
and no further action is required on the part of the Company or its
stockholders to authorize any Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (including the Merger). The
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms.



 

D-3 4\. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents,
the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents (including the Merger), do not and will not conflict
with or result in any violation of or default under any provision of the
CompanyÂ’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, and, do
not and will not violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute
a default under any judgment, decree or order that is known by us to be
applicable to the Company.

5\. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of
the Company consisted of (i) [ ] shares of Company Common Stock,
of which on the date hereof [ ] shares are issued and outstanding
and (ii) [ ] shares of Company Preferred Stock, of which on the
date hereof (A) [ ] shares have been designated Series A Preferred
Stock, of which on the date hereof [ ] shares are issued and
outstanding, (B) [ ] shares have been designated Series B Preferred
Stock, of which on the date hereof [ ] shares are issued and
outstanding, (C) [ ] shares have been designated Series B-1
Preferred Stock, of which on the date hereof [ ] shares are issued
and outstanding, (D) [ ] shares have been designated Series C
Preferred Stock, of which on the date hereof [ ] shares are issued
and outstanding. [ ] shares have been reserved for issuance
pursuant to the CompanyÂ’s 2005 Stock Plan. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as set forth in Section
3.2 of the Agreement, to our knowledge, there are no outstanding options,
warrants, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights to
subscribe for or acquire any securities of the Company.

6\. No consent, approval or authorization of or designation, declaration or
filing with any federal or other governmental authority is required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger, except for the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware and the filing
of the Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission in
connection with the HSR Act.

* * * 

In addition, to our knowledge, but without having investigated any
governmental records or court dockets, and without having made any other
independent investigation, there are no actions or, proceedings pending or
overtly threatened in writing against the Company that seek to enjoin or
otherwise challenge the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
or in any manner draw into question the validity of the Transaction
Documents.
