INDEMNIFICATION</B>

Partnership, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent
contractors, stockholders, principals, partners, agents, or representatives (each an &#147;Indemnified
Person&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Indemnified Persons&#148;) against, and to hold each Indemnified Person
harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person relating to or
arising out of or in connection with (a)&nbsp;any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by the Shareholders in this Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;any breach of or failure by any
Shareholder to perform any of its covenants or obligations set out or contemplated in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate
liability of Shareholder and Barberry Corp. for any and all obligations under this Agreement shall
in no event exceed the Merger Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.2 <U>Claims</U>. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a claim
for indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the
Shareholders (&#147;Indemnifying Person&#148;) of such claim and the amount the Indemnified Person will be
entitled to receive hereunder from the Indemnifying Person; provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced
thereby. If the Indemnifying Person does not object in writing to such indemnification claim
within 30&nbsp;days of receiving notice thereof, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover, on
the thirty-fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the amount of such
claim, and no later objection by the Indemnifying Person shall be permitted; if the Indemnifying
Person agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay
only a lesser amount, the Indemnified Person shall nevertheless be entitled to recover, on the
thirty-fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the lesser amount,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">prejudice to the Indemnified
Person&#146;s claim for the difference. In addition to the amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Person from the Indemnifying Person pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, the Indemnified Person shall also be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Person
interest on such amounts at the rate of Two Times Prime from, and including, the thirty-fifth day after such notice of an indemnification claim is given to, but not including, the
date such recovery is actually made by the Indemnified Person.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.3 <U>Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense</U>. The Indemnified Person shall
give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of
any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto
(a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person
shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding (a)&nbsp;upon notice to the
Indemnified Person and (b)&nbsp;upon delivery by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person a
written agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification for all Losses arising
out of such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be
liable for the entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Person&#146;s counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and (ii)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified
Person&#146;s reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third
Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Person. If, however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment that
representation by the Indemnifying Person&#146;s counsel of both the Indemnifying Person and the
Indemnified Person would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnified
Person may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any such Third Party Claim, action,
suit or proceeding and the Indemnifying Person shall pay all of the fees and disbursements in
connection with the retention of such separate counsel. If the Indemnifying Person fails to

effectively do so, personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that the
service thereof may be made by any means permitted by Section&nbsp;0 (other than facsimile

contemplated hereby (including fees and disbursements of counsel, consultants and accountants)
incurred by (a)&nbsp;the Shareholders shall be paid and borne exclusively by the Shareholders, and (b)
the Partnership shall be paid and borne exclusively by the Partnership. Notwithstanding the

warranty or covenant by such party, then such breaching party shall reimburse the non-breaching
party for all such expenses, fees and cash, including for all expenses, fees and cash incurred in
