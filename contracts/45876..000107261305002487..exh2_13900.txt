"AGREEMENT") is entered into on this 20th day of September, 2005, by and
between  (1) Sun HB Holdings, LLC, a limited liability company formed under
the laws of  the State of Delaware, U.S.A. (hereinafter referred to as
"SELLER"), and  (2) Harsco Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the
laws of the state  of Delaware (hereinafter referred to as
"PURCHASER").    RECITALS   1. Seller is the owner of 100% of the issued
share capital of Hunnebeck Group  GmbH, registered in the commercial register
of the local court of  Dusseldorf under HRB 48411 (hereinafter referred to as
"HOLDCO"). Holdco  has a registered share capital of EUR 25,000, divided into
two shares, in  the respective nominal amounts of EUR 24,000 and EUR 1,000,
both of which  are owned by Seller. The shares mentioned in the preceeding
sentence are  referred to herein as the "SOLD SHARES".  2. Holdco is the
parent company of a group engaged in the rental, servicing  and sale of
formwork systems and scaffolding systems. Holdco, directly or  indirectly,
owns the interests in the subsidiaries set out in EXHIBIT R.  Holdco and the
subsidiaries set out in EXHIBIT R are collectively referred  to herein as the
"HUNNEBECK GROUP". All entities of the Hunnebeck Group are  referred to
herein collectively as the "COMPANIES" and individually as a 
"COMPANY".  3. Seller and all entities affiliated with Seller (at the
relevant time)  within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock
Corporation Act  (AKTG), other than any members of the Hunnebeck Group, are
referred to  herein as the "SELLER\'S GROUP".  4. Seller wishes to divest
itself of the Hunnebeck Group and Purchaser wishes  to acquire the Hunnebeck
Group. Therefore, Seller and Purchaser  (hereinafter referred to as the
"PARTIES") agree as follows:          6    ARTICLE 1  SALE AND
PURCHASE OF THE SOLD SHARES   1.1 AGREEMENT TO SELL AND PURCHASE   Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,  Seller
hereby sells to Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby purchases from  Seller, all
of the shares held by Seller in Holdco.   1.2 SHARE TRANSFER   At the
Closing (as defined below in Article 4.1), Seller shall assign and  transfer
to Purchaser the Sold Shares in accordance with ARTICLE 4.5.   1.3 DIVIDEND
RIGHTS   The Sold Shares shall be sold and transferred to Purchaser with all
rights  and obligations pertaining thereto.    ARTICLE 2  PURCHASE
PRICE   2.1 PURCHASE PRICE   (a) The purchase price for the Sold Shares
(the "PURCHASE PRICE") shall be  equal to:   (i) EUR 140 million (in words:
Euro one hundred and forty million);   (ii) plus an amount equal to the Cash
(as defined below);   (iii) minus an amount equal to the Financial Debt (as
defined below);   (iv) minus an amount equal to the Capital Lease
Obligations (as  defined below).   (b) For the purpose of this
Agreement:   "CASH" means, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate amount
(including  any accrued interest thereon) of any cash (KASSENBESTAND) and
cash  equivalents of the Hunnebeck Group (excluding, for the avoidance of 
doubt, the aggregate amount of monies received by the Companies from  account
debtors and note debtors prior   7    to Closing Date merely as
administrator of such accounts receivable  and notes on the basis of the
"Vendor Financed Business Collection  Agreement" entered into between
Hunnebeck GmbH on the one side and  ThyssenKrupp AG and ThyssenKrupp Systems
and Services GmbH on the other  side as of 14 March 2002, as amended as of 24
March 2005, and not  transferred before Closing Date to ThyssenKrupp AG
and/or its  affiliates), all as determined on a consolidated basis for the 
Hunnebeck Group as a whole in accordance with US GAAP (as defined  below);
cash equivalents shall include, without limitation, cheques,  deposits with
banks and other financial institutions and the Seller\'s  Group, highly
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or  less from the Closing
Date, money market funds; 40 % of the total  amount of security and other
deposits of the Hunnebeck Group as of  Closing Date shall be considered Cash;
for the avoidance of doubt,  accounts receivable being accounted for on the
intercompany clearing  account (VERRECHNUNGSKONTO MIT SELLER\'S GROUP)
against the Seller\'s  Group shall be treated as Cash and for the further
avoidance of doubt,  highly liquid claims of Companies against other
Companies shall not  constitute Cash.   "FINANCIAL DEBT" means, as of the
Closing Date, the aggregate amount  (including any accrued interest thereon)
of all interest-bearing  indebtedness of the Hunnebeck Group arising out of
borrowings  (DARLEHEN) from banks and other credit institutions and the
Seller\'s  Group; all obligations evidenced by a note, bond, debenture or
similar  instrument and any and all accrued interest on any of the
foregoing  obligations; it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt,
that,  notwithstanding any accounting principle, policy or practice to the 
contrary, Capital Lease Obligations and all payables resulting from  supplies
and services (VERBINDLICHKEITEN AUS LIEFERUNGEN UND  LEISTUNGEN) shall be
deemed not to be Financial Debt, and that  unfunded, underfunded or
contingent obligations such as, without  limitation, company pension plans,
letters of credit or guarantees  shall not be or be deemed to be Financial
Debt; and it being further  understood and agreed that the amount of any
element of Financial Debt  with respect to which Seller provides a payoff
letter from the lender  as of the Closing Date shall be fixed and determined
to be the amount  shown on such payoff letter as due as of the Closing Date
for all  purposes under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any 
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this ARTICLE 2 or ARTICLE  3 of
this Agreement; for the avoidance of doubt, payables being  accounted for on
the intercompany clearing account (VERRECHNUNGSKONTO  MIT SELLER\'S GROUP)
vis-a-vis the Seller\'s Group shall be treated as  Financial Debt and for the
further avoidance of doubt, interest  bearing indebtedness of Companies
arising out of borrowings from other  Companies shall not constitute
Financial Debt.   "CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS" means, as of the Closing Date,
the  aggregate amount of all capital lease obligations of the Hunnebeck 
Group (excluding any   8    breakage or other similar costs unless
actually incurred and becoming  effective as a result of a change of control
provision at Closing),  all as determined on a consolidated basis for the
Hunnebeck Group as a  whole in accordance with US GAAP (as defined
below).   2.2 PAYMENTS ON THE CLOSING DATE   (a) Not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller  shall deliver to Purchaser
in writing Seller\'s good faith estimate of  the Purchase Price, calculated
in accordance with ARTICLE 2.1 (the  "ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE"). The
calculation of the Estimated Purchase  Price shall be based upon, and the
written good faith estimate shall  show, Seller\'s estimates of the Cash (the
"ESTIMATED CASH"), the  Financial Debt (the "ESTIMATED FINANCIAL DEBT"), and
the Capital Lease  Obligations (the "ESTIMATED CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS").
The  calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price shall occur as set forth 
in ARTICLE 2.1, except that the term "CASH" shall be replaced with the  term
"ESTIMATED CASH", the term "FINANCIAL DEBT" shall be replaced  with the term
"ESTIMATED FINANCIAL DEBT", and the term "CAPITAL LEASE  OBLIGATIONS" shall
be replaced with the term "ESTIMATED CAPITAL LEASE  OBLIGATIONS". For the
purposes of this Agreement, a "BUSINESS DAY"  shall be any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or any other day on  which banks in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany, are generally closed.   (b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller the Estimated  Purchase Price.   2.3 MODE OF PAYMENT;
DEFAULT; SET-OFF   (a) Any payments to be made under this ARTICLE 2 or
ARTICLE 3 of this  Agreement shall be made in Euros by irrevocable wire
transfer of  immediately available funds to a bank account specified by the 
relevant Party to the other Party (provided that such specification  has been
made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the relevant due  date). Any
such payment shall be deemed to have been duly made only  upon the
irrevocable and unconditional crediting of the amount payable  (without
deduction of any costs or charges, other than those of  Seller\'s bank) to
the relevant bank account on, and effective as of,  the relevant due
date.    (b) Any failure by either Party to make any payment pursuant to
this  ARTICLE 2 or ARTICLE 3 of this Agreement when it is due shall result 
in such Party\'s immediate default (VERZUG), without any reminder by  the
other Party being required.   9    (c) No Party shall be entitled to
exercise any right of set-off or  retention right with respect to its payment
obligations pursuant to  this ARTICLE 2 or ARTICLE 3 of this Agreement.   
ARTICLE 3  CLOSING CERTIFICATE; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS   3.1 PREPARATION
OF DRAFT CLOSING CERTIFICATE   As promptly as practicable, but not later
than 45 days after the Closing  Date, Purchaser shall prepare and shall
deliver to Seller a certificate  (the "DRAFT CLOSING CERTIFICATE") setting
forth the calculation of (i) the  Cash, (ii) the Financial Debt, (iii) the
Capital Lease Obligations, and  (iv) the Purchase Price that would have been
calculated using such amounts  pursuant to ARTICLE 2.1(A).   3.2
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES   The Draft Closing Certificate shall be prepared, to
the extent applicable  according to the definitions in ARTICLE 2.1(B), in
accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America  (as in force as of 30 September 2004), as applied on a
basis consistent  with the principles used in the preparation of financial
statements of  Holdco as of 30 September 2004 ("US GAAP"), (as audited by
Grant Thornton  GmbH, attached hereto in EXHIBIT 3.2, and, for the avoidance
of doubt,  being POST purchase price allocation with respect to the
acquisition of the  Hunnebeck Group by Seller\'s Group in 2003) ("2004
FINANCIAL Statements").  Any amount not denominated in Euros shall be
converted to Euros at the  exchange rate in effect one Business Day before
the Closing Date using the  rate quoted on the Reuters Screen Page at 11.30
a.m. Frankfurt/Main.   3.3 REVIEW OF DRAFT CLOSING CERTIFICATE   Seller
and its representatives shall have 45 Business Days after delivery  of the
Draft Closing Certificate pursuant to ARTICLE 3.1 in which to review  the
Draft Closing Certificate. Purchaser will cooperate with and assist  Seller
and its representatives, and shall cause the relevant entities of  the
Hunnebeck Group to cooperate with and assist Seller and its  representatives,
in such review of the Draft Closing Certificate. Such  cooperation and
assistance shall include making available all relevant  books and records of
the Hunnebeck Group and any other relevant information  relating to the
Hunnebeck Group including, if applicable, the working  papers of Purchaser\'s
certified public accountants, providing reasonable  access during regular
business hours to the Hunnebeck   10    Group\'s premises, and allowing
interviews with the Hunnebeck Group\'s  directors, officers and employees,
provided, however, that such cooperation  and assistance will be provided
only to the extent that such cooperation  does not unreasonably disrupt the
business of the Hunnebeck Group, and only  to the extent beneficial for the
performance of such review by Seller. If  Seller believes that the
calculation of any item or amount contained in the  Draft Closing Certificate
(as delivered to Seller pursuant to ARTICLE 3.1)  is not correct, then Seller
may, at or prior to the end of such 45 Business  Day review period, deliver a
notice to Purchaser disagreeing with the  preparation and/or calculation and
setting forth Seller\'s calculation of  the relevant items or amounts. Any
such notice of disagreement shall  specify, in reasonable detail, (i) those
items or amounts as to which  Seller disagrees and, if and to the extent
possible for Seller, (ii) the  items or amounts which should replace the
disagreeable items or amounts. If  Seller does not deliver a timely notice to
Purchaser in accordance with  this ARTICLE 3.3, the Draft Closing Certificate
shall be conclusive and  binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to
any appeal, unless such  failure is due to Purchaser\'s lack of cooperation
and/or assistance (as  described above).   3.4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION   (a)
If Seller has duly delivered a notice of disagreement in accordance  with
ARTICLE 3.3, then the Parties shall, during the 30 calendar day  period
following such delivery (or any other period of time mutually  agreed upon in
writing between the Parties), use reasonable commercial  efforts to reach an
agreement on the disputed items or amounts. If and  to the extent that,
during such period, the Parties are unable to  reach such agreement, then
either Party may refer the remaining  differences to KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-
Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft  Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft,
Dusseldorf/Germany (the "ACCOUNTING  FIRM"). If such firm refuses to act as
the Accounting Firm and the  Parties cannot mutually agree upon another firm
to be appointed as the  Accounting Firm within 10 Business Days, then the
Accounting Firm,  which must be qualified to perform audits pursuant to US
GAAP, shall  be appointed, upon request of either Party, by the Institute
of  Chartered Accountants (INSTITUT DER WIRTSCHAFTSPRUFER) in Dusseldorf 
(Germany).   (b) The Accounting Firm, acting as an expert (SCHIEDSGUTACHTER)
and not as  an arbitrator, shall, based on the standards set forth in
ARTICLES 2  and 3.2, decide whether and to what extent the Draft Closing 
Certificate requires adjustment. The Accounting Firm, in making its 
determination, shall only take into account any remaining differences 
submitted to it and shall limit its determination to the scope of the 
dispute between the Parties.   11    (c) Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate with and assist, and shall cause  their respective accountants to
cooperate with and assist, and  Purchaser shall cause the Companies to
cooperate with and assist, the  Accounting Firm in the conduct of its review.
Such cooperation and  assistance shall include, without limitation, the
making available to  the Accounting Firm of all relevant books and records of
the Hunnebeck  Group and any other information relating to the Hunnebeck
Group  (including accountants\' workpapers). If and to the extent that the 
Accounting Firm cannot resolve the dispute on any item or amount on  the
merits because it has not been provided with the relevant  documents or
information, the Accounting Firm shall decide against the  Party who has
failed to provide such documents or information.   (d) The Parties shall
instruct the Accounting Firm to deliver its written  opinion (including
reasons for the Accounting Firm\'s decision on each  disputed item) to them
no later than 45 Business Days (or within any  other period of time mutually
agreed upon in writing between the  Parties) after the remaining differences
have been referred to it. The  decision of the Accounting Firm shall be
conclusive and binding on the  Parties (within the limits set forth in
Section 319 of the German  Civil Code (BGB)) and shall not be subject to any
appeal. The fees and  disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Purchaser, on  the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage  which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party  bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example,
if  Seller claims that the Closing Date Financial Debt is EUR 1,000  greater
than the amount determined by Purchaser, and Purchaser  contests only EUR 500
of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the  Accounting Firm ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Seller EUR  300 of the EUR 500 contested,
then the costs and expenses of the  Accounting Firm will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300 / 500 x 100 %) to  Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500 x 100%) to
Seller. In connection  with its review, the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant
to the terms of  this ARTICLE 3.4(D), also determine the allocation of its
fees and  expenses between Purchaser and Seller, which determination shall
be  conclusive and binding upon the Parties.   3.5 FINAL AMOUNTS   (a)
The Draft Closing Certificate, incorporating the resolution of matters  in
dispute (if any) pursuant to ARTICLE 3.4 above, or, in the  alternative, the
Draft Closing Certificate as not objected to by  Seller, is referred to as
the "FINAL CLOSING CERTIFICATE". The Final  Closing Certificate shall have
the legal effect of an arbitral award  and shall be final, binding, and
conclusive on the Parties.   12    (b) Subject to the other provisions of
this ARTICLE 3.5:   (i) if the Cash reflected on the Final Closing
Certificate (the  "FINAL CASH") is greater than the Estimated Cash, then
Purchaser  shall be obligated to make a payment to Seller in an amount
equal  to such excess; and   (ii) if the Final Cash is less than the
Estimated Cash, then Seller  shall be obligated to make a payment to
Purchaser in an amount  equal to such shortfall.   (c) Subject to the other
provisions of this ARTICLE 3.5:   (i) if the Financial Debt reflected on the
Final Closing Certificate  (the "FINAL FINANCIAL DEBT") is greater than the
Estimated  Financial Debt, then Seller shall be obligated to make a payment 
to Purchaser in an amount equal to such excess; and   (ii) if the Final
Financial Debt is less than the Estimated Financial  Debt, then Purchaser
shall be obligated to make a payment to  Seller in an amount equal to such
shortfall.   (d) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE 3.5:  
(i) if the Capital Lease Obligations reflected on the Final Closing 
Certificate (the "FINAL CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS") is greater  than the
Estimated Capital Lease Obligations, then Seller shall  be obligated to make
a payment to Purchaser in an amount equal to  such excess; and   (ii) if
the Final Capital Lease Obligations is less than the Estimated  Capital Lease
Obligations, then Purchaser shall be obligated to  make a payment to Seller
in an amount equal to such shortfall.   (e) All payments, if any, made
pursuant to ARTICLE 3.5(B) through (D)  shall be deemed to be further
adjustments to the Estimated Purchase  Price, and the Estimated Purchase
Price as so adjusted shall be the  "FINAL PURCHASE PRICE".   (f) The
difference, if any, between the Estimated Purchase Price and the  Final
Purchase Price, together with interest thereon from and after  the Closing
Date up to and including the date of payment at a rate of  6 % (six per cent)
PER ANNUM, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller (if  the Final Purchase Price
is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price)  or by Seller to Purchaser (if
the Estimated Purchase Price is greater  than the Final Purchase Price) by
wire transfer of immediately  available funds within five (5) Business Days
after the Final Purchase  Price has been finally determined in accordance
with this ARTICLE 3.   13    ARTICLE 4  CLOSING    4.1 PLACE AND
TIME OF CLOSING   The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as set  forth in ARTICLE 4.5 below (the "CLOSING"), shall take
place at the offices  of Jones Day in Frankfurt am Main at 10 a.m. on the
third Business Day  after the day on which the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE 4.2 below are  met, or at any other time or place as the Parties may
mutually agree in  writing. The date on which the Closing is completed is
referred to herein  as the "CLOSING DATE".   4.2 CONDITIONS TO CLOSING  
(a) The obligations of Purchaser and Seller to consummate the Closing are 
subject to the satisfaction of all of the following conditions 
precedent:   (i) The Closing shall be permissible pursuant to Article 41 of
the  German Act against Restraints of Competition (GWB);   (ii) The Closing
shall be permissible in Poland, Norway and Slovakia  in accordance with
applicable law;   (iii) No enforceable judgment, injunction, order or decree
by any  court or governmental authority in the European Union or any  other
applicable jurisdiction shall prohibit the consummation of  the Closing;  
(iv) No Material Adverse Effect (as defined below in ARTICLE 5) has  arisen
between the date hereof and the date on which all the  other conditions under
this ARTICLE 4.2(A) have been satisfied.    (b) The conditions to Closing
set forth in Articles 4.2(a)(i), (ii) and  (iii) may be waived only by both
Parties jointly. The condition to  Closing set forth in Article 4.2(a)(iv)
may be waived only by  Purchaser. Subject to any such waivers, all conditions
to Closing  shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon completion of the
Closing.   4.3 MERGER CONTROL PROCEEDINGS; OTHER REGULATORY
REQUIREMENTS   (a) Purchaser (and Seller, to the extent any filing cannot be
made by  Purchaser on behalf of Seller under applicable law) shall ensure
that  any filings necessary in   14    connection with any merger
control clearance referred to in ARTICLE  4.2(A)(I) and (II) and any other
filings with, or notifications to,  any governmental authority required in
connection with this Agreement  will be made as soon as is practicable, in
any event within three (3)  Business Days after the date hereof. Any filings
and notifications  made by Purchaser shall require the prior written consent
of Seller.  Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.    (b) In
order to obtain all requisite approvals for the transactions  contemplated by

reasonably cooperate in all respects with each  other in the preparation of
any filing or notification and in  connection with any submission,
investigation or inquiry, (ii) supply  to any competent authority as promptly
as practicable any additional  information requested pursuant to any
applicable laws and take all  other procedural actions required in order to
obtain any necessary  clearance or to cause any applicable waiting periods to
commence and  expire, (iii) promptly provide each other with copies of any
written  communication (or written summaries of any non-written
communication)  in connection with any proceeding and (iv) contact any
competent  authority only after consultation with the other Party and give
each  other and their respective advisors the opportunity to participate in 
all meetings and conferences with any competent authority unless such 
participation would be not permitted by the competent authority or  would
impose a significant delay on the merger control proceedings.   (c)
Purchaser shall offer, consent to, and comply with, any obligations or 
conditions (AUFLAGEN UND BEDINGUNGEN), commitments (ZUSAGEN) or other 
agreements required by any competent merger control authority as a  condition
to the clearance of the transactions contemplated hereby,  unless such
obligation or condition, commitment or other agreement  would alter the
character of the transaction contemplated hereby  materially or would
materially affect the business operations of  Purchaser or the Hunnebeck
Group, and as a result thereof, such  consent or compliance by Purchaser
would have to be considered as  unreasonable (UNZUMUTBAR) to Purchaser.   
(d) With respect to the conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE 4.2(A), 
if the consummation of the Closing is prohibited by any governmental 
authority or Court, the Parties shall use their reasonable commercial 
efforts to cooperate in contesting such decision in order to seek to  effect
the Closing as contemplated by this Agreement as timely as is  reasonably
practicable.   (e) The Parties shall not be entitled to request or obtain
from each other  any adjustment of the Purchase Price or other amendment to
this  Agreement as a result of any divestiture (in the case of Purchaser)
or  other action pursuant to this ARTICLE   15    4.3 or of any decision
by a competent authority after the Closing Date  prohibiting any transaction
contemplated hereby, or any losses,  damages, costs or expenses associated
therewith.   4.4 SELLER\'S DELIVERIES ON OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

evidence of the release of any pledge and other security interests  granted

liability to pay any fees or  commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to any of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
Seller could become  liable.   6.3 FINANCIAL CAPABILITY; SOLVENCY   (a)
Purchaser has sufficient immediately available funds or binding and 
unconditional financing commitments to enable it to make all payments 
required to be made by it under this Agreement.   (b) Purchaser is not now
insolvent, has not been insolvent during the past  24 months, and will not be
rendered insolvent by any of the  transactions contemplated hereby. As used
in this ARTICLE 6.3,  "insolvent" means that the sum of the debts and other
probable  liabilities of Purchaser exceeds the present fair saleable value
of  Purchaser\'s assets.   (c) Immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby: (i) Purchaser will be
able to pay  its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of its 
business; (ii) Purchaser will not have unreasonably small capital with  which
to conduct its present or proposed business; (iii) Purchaser  will have
assets (calculated at fair market value) that exceed its  liabilities; and
(iv) taking into account all pending and threatened  litigation, final
judgments against Purchaser in actions for money  damages are not reasonably
anticipated to be rendered at a time when,  or in amounts such that,
Purchaser will be unable to satisfy any such  judgments promptly in
accordance with their terms (taking into account  the maximum probable amount
of such judgments in any such actions and  the earliest reasonable time at
which such judgments might be  rendered) as well as all other liabilities of
Purchaser. The cash  available to Purchaser, after taking into account all
other  anticipated uses of the cash, will be sufficient to pay all such 
liabilities and judgments promptly in accordance with their terms.  
30    ARTICLE 7  COVENANTS   7.1 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PRIOR TO
CLOSING   From the date hereof to the Closing Date, except as disclosed in
EXHIBIT  7.1 or contemplated by this Agreement:   (a) Seller shall procure

long as such  financial transactions are reflected, or taken into account,
in  the post-closing adjustments of the Purchase Price); or   (ii) any

another Company); or   (iii) any declaration or payment of dividends by any
Company to any  member of the Seller\'s Group.   (b) Seller shall cause (to
the extent permitted under applicable law) the  Companies to conduct their

with past practice and not to take, or  commit to take, any of the actions
set forth in the following CLAUSES  (I) - (IX) without Purchaser\'s prior
written approval:   (i) any divestiture by any Company of a shareholding or
business;   (ii) any borrowing by any Company in excess of EUR 500,000.00 
individually or any guarantee granted by any Company for any  third party\'s
indebtedness in excess of EUR 250,000.00, other  than (i) indebtedness
incurred from, or guarantees granted to,  any other Company or (ii)
indebtedness incurred, or guarantees  granted by any Company, in the ordinary

practice, and other  than any additional incurrence or advance under any
credit  facility to which any Company is a party or under which it may 
borrow, in each case as of the date hereof;   31    (iii) any investment
by any Company in, or the making of any loan to,  any other company or entity
(other than any entity of the  Hunnebeck Group) exceeding in each case EUR
500,000.00;   (iv) any capital expenditure by any Company, by additions or 
improvements to property, plant or equipment, in excess of EUR  500,000.00

the workforce  of the Hunnebeck Group;   (vi) any change in, or commitment

as required due to a concurrent  change in generally accepted accounting
principles;   (viii) any transaction entered into by any Company outside
the  ordinary course of business which has had, or would reasonably be 
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect; or   (ix) the entering into
pooling agreements (UNTERNEHMENSVERTRAGE)  within the meaning of Sect. 291
ss. of the German Stock  Corporation Act.   (c) Seller shall procure that
all Companies manage all working capital  accounts consistent with the normal
course of business and its past  practices, including (but not limited to)
(i) not accelerating  collections of accounts receivables out of the normal
course  inconsistent with past practices, (ii) not delaying payments of 
payables and other obligations beyond the normal course inconsistent  with
past practices, and (iii) procuring inventory in reasonable  amounts needed
for the current business as conducted as of the date  hereof.   7.2
CONFIDENTIALITY   For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Seller
shall keep  confidential and not disclose to any third party any business or
trade  secrets of the Hunnebeck Group, other than those which have become
publicly  known through no fault of the Seller\'s Group or which the
Seller\'s Group is  required to disclose in order to comply with any
legal   32    requirements or stock exchange regulations. Such
confidentiality obligation  shall be satisfied if Seller or the relevant
members of the Seller\'s Group  exercise the same care with respect to such
information as they would take  to preserve the confidentiality of their own
similar information (SORGFALT  IN EIGENEN ANGELEGENHEITEN).   7.3 ACCESS
TO INFORMATION AFTER CLOSING   After the Closing Date, Purchaser will
promptly afford to Seller and its  representatives access, upon reasonable
advance notice, to accounting,  financial and other records (and allow them
to make copies thereof), as  well as to other information, management,
employees and auditors of the  Hunnebeck Group to the extent necessary or
useful to the Seller\'s Group in  connection with any audit, investigation,
dispute or litigation or any  other reasonable business purpose of the
Seller\'s Group. Purchaser shall  keep, and procure that the entities of the
Hunnebeck Group will keep, all  books and records relating to any period
prior to the Closing Date in  accordance with and during the periods required
under applicable law, but  in any event for a period of not less than seven
(7) years. Purchaser  agrees to cause the Companies to give Seller reasonable
notice prior to  transferring, discarding or destroying any books or records
of the  Companies relating to any matters which may be relevant with respect
to any  indemnity obligation of Seller under this Agreement (in particular to
any  tax matter relating to any period prior to the Closing Date) and, if
Seller  so requests, to deliver such books or records to Seller.   7.4
FURTHER ASSURANCES; COOPERATION   Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Parties will use  reasonable commercial efforts to
execute, or cause to be executed, all  agreements and documents and to take,
or cause to be taken, all other  actions necessary under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that  (notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement) Seller shall not  have any liability arising from the failure to
obtain any third party  consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or from  any defections of suppliers, customers or
employees after the date hereof.   7.5 DandO; INSURANCE TAIL COVERAGE  
Purchaser shall procure, at its expense, tail coverage for all the  Hunnebeck
Group\'s directors and officers under existing director and officer  insurance
policies (including those listed in EXHIBIT 7.5) covering at  least a damage
in the aggregate amount of EUR 7,000,000.00 (Euro seven  million), for a
period until the earlier of (i) the lapse of the applicable  statute of
limitations, and (ii) the sixth anniversary after the Closing  Date.  
33    ARTICLE 8  INDEMNIFICATION   8.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER AND
PURCHASER   (a) Subject to the provisions contained in this ARTICLE 8,
Seller shall  indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from the amount of any
Losses  (as defined below) asserted against, incurred or suffered by
Purchaser  or the Hunnebeck Group as a result of a breach of any
representation,  covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement,
provided  that Seller has not remedied the breach within a reasonable time
after  Seller has been notified of such breach pursuant to ARTICLE 8.7(A) 
below. Indemnification under this ARTICLE 8 shall be the sole and  exclusive
remedy for any breach of any representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement
of Seller or any other provision of this  Agreement or otherwise, other than
proven claims for intentional and  knowing fraud. For the purpose of this
Agreement, "LOSSES" shall mean  all and only those liabilities, reasonable
costs and expenses and  other damages within the meaning of Sections 249 et
seq. of the German  Civil Code, excluding, however, any and all consequential
or indirect  damages (FOLGESCHADEN, MITTELBARE SCHADEN), lost profits
(ENTGANGENER  GEWINN), frustrated expenses (VERGEBLICHE AUFWENDUNGEN) within
the  meaning of Section 284 of the German Civil Code, internal 
administration and overhead costs, and specifically excluding any and  all
damages and other amounts computed as or with reference to any  "multiple of
profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation  methodology. Any
Loss shall be computed net of (i) any present  benefits (including avoided
losses, tax benefits and savings as well  as increases in the value of any
asset owned by the Hunnebeck Group,  provided that such benefit could have
been realized in the same fiscal  year as the Loss) related to the relevant
matter and (ii) any amounts  which are covered by insurance or would have
been recoverable under  any insurance policy as existing on the Closing Date
if the insurance  coverage had been continued without change (including
reasonable  increases in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
past  practice) but increased by any increase in insurance premium 
exclusively resulting from such recovery and paid for in a three year  period
after Closing or (iii) any amounts which have been otherwise  recovered from
any third party (it being understood that Purchaser  shall not in bad faith
refrain from pursuing claims against third  parties).   34    (b)
Subject to the provisions contained in this ARTICLE 8, Purchaser shall 
indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any Losses asserted against, 
incurred or suffered by Seller or any member or affiliate of the  Seller\'s
Group as a result of a breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this  Agreement. Without prejudice to any
other indemnification obligations  of Seller and Purchaser contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall  further indemnify and hold harmless Seller from
any claims made by any  member of the Hunnebeck Group after the Closing Date
relating to  Seller\'s shareholding or interest in, or any action taken as 
shareholder or partner of, any such member of the Hunnebeck Group  prior to
the Closing Date.   (c) No Party shall be liable under this Agreement for
any Loss to the  extent that such Loss is attributable to a failure by the
other Party  to mitigate the Loss (Section 254 of the German Civil
Code).   8.2 LOSSES REFLECTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; INDEMNIFICATION BY
THYSSENKRUPP   Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser for any Losses to the
extent that:   (a) such Losses do not exceed the monetary amount reflected
or accounted  for as a write-off, value adjustment, liability or provision, 
including general adjustments (e.g. PAUSCHALWERTBERICHTIGUNGEN) or 
provisions made for the relevant risk category, in the 2004 Financial 
Statements; and   (b) Purchaser or any of the Companies have been
indemnified from  ThyssenKrupp Systems and Services GmbH or ThyssenKrupp France
SA or  ThyssenKrupp Serv Austria Ges.mbH (or any legal successor of such 
entities) under the Umbrella Agreement between the above-mentioned 
ThyssenKrupp entities and Sun HB GmbH dated 22 June 2003 (Deed-Roll  No.
441/2003 of the notary public Dr. Peter Sauberlich with seat in  Frankfurt am
Main) (it being understood that Purchaser or any of the  Companies must first
pursue any claims under the Umbrella Agreement).   8.3 DISCLOSED OR KNOWN
MATTERS   Seller shall not be liable for a breach of a representation of
Seller if  the underlying facts of the breach have been disclosed (in writing
or made  available electronically) to Purchaser or its representatives or
advisers  prior to the date hereof or made available otherwise (in writing or
made  available electronically) for the purpose of the due diligence 
investigation conducted by Purchaser. However, except for the documents 
specifically listed in EXHIBIT 8.3, the appendices and schedules to the 
Umbrella   35    Agreement between ThyssenKrupp Systems and Services GmbH,
ThyssenKrupp France  SA and ThyssenKrupp Serv Austria Ges.mbH on the one side
and Sun HB GmbH on  the other side dated 22 June 2003 (Deed-Roll No. 441/2003
of the notary  public Dr. Peter Sauberlich with seat in Frankfurt am Main)
shall not be  deemed to have been disclosed or made available to Purchaser or
its  representatives or advisers). Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, Section 442 of the German Civil Code shall not apply.   8.4
THRESHOLDS AND AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF SELLER\'S AND PURCHASER\'S LIABILITY  
(a) Seller shall only be liable for any Losses arising from a breach of a 
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller or any other 
provision of this Agreement, and under all indemnities contained  herein
(other than Seller\'s obligation to deliver the Sold Shares  against payment
of the full Purchase Price), if and to the extent any  Loss with respect to
an individual matter exceeds an amount of EUR  50,000 (the "DE MINIMIS
AMOUNT") and then only if and to the extent  that all indemnifiable Losses
above the De Minimis Amount exceed an  aggregate amount of EUR 500,000 (the
"DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT") (in which  case only the excess amount above the
Deductible Amount shall be  recoverable).   (b) Seller\'s liability arising
out of or in connection with this  Agreement, including for the breach of all
representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements or any other
provisions of this  Agreement, and under all indemnities contained herein,
with the sole  exception of the representations given by Seller to
Purchaser  according to ARTICLE 5.2 (Ownership of Shares; Shareholdings)
and  ARTICLE 5.15 (Taxes), shall be limited to the respective amount to be 
held in escrow in accordance with ARTICLE 8.5 (the "MAXIMUM AMOUNT"). 
Seller\'s liability arising out of the representations made in ARTICLE  5.2
shall be limited to an amount equal to 50% of the Purchase Price  and
Seller\'s liability arising out of the representations made in  ARTICLE 5.15
shall be limited to an amount equal to 25% of the  Purchase Price.   (c)
The thresholds and caps which apply to Seller\'s liability according to 
ARTICLE 8.4 (A) AND (B) shall apply to Purchaser\'s liability as
well.   8.5 ESCROW ACCOUNT   Subject to ARTICLE 8.10, Purchaser shall
transfer at Closing an amount of  EUR 5,000,000 out of the proceeds of the
Estimated Purchase Price being  paid from Purchaser to Seller into an escrow
account (the "ESCROW  ACCOUNT"). One year after the Closing Date, EUR
2,500,000 plus the entire  interest accrued on the entire amount being held
in the Escrow Account, and  two years after the Closing Date the remaining
EUR 2,500,000 plus   36    the interest accrued thereon shall be released
from the Escrow Account and  transferred to a bank account designated by
Seller, except for (i) such  amounts having being released from the Escrow
Account to Purchaser due to  claims made by Purchaser against Seller
according to ARTICLE 8.7 and (ii)  such amounts being subject to claims made
by Purchaser against Seller  according to ARTICLE 8.7 and not being resolved
at the relevant time.  Details of the Escrow Account are set forth in the
escrow agreement  attached as EXHIBIT 8.5 (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT") which will
be, subject to  ARTICLE 8.10, executed at Closing substantially in the form
as attached.  The Parties shall without undue delay after the date hereof
inquire whether  JP Morgan, at terms acceptable to both Parties, shall act as
escrow agent.  If that is not the case, then the Parties shall agree in good
faith upon  another escrow agent. If the Parties cannot agree upon another
escrow  agent, the acting notary shall serve as escrow agent. The fees of
the  escrow agent are borne by Purchaser.   8.6 LIMITATION PERIODS   All
claims of Purchaser or Seller under any representation, warranty,  covenant
or agreement of Seller or other provision of this Agreement, and  under all
indemnities contained herein or otherwise, shall be time-barred  (VERJAHREN)
upon expiration of a period of 24 months after the Closing Date  (the
"LIMITATION PERIOD"), except for claims under the representations of  Seller
contained in ARTICLE 5.2 (Ownership of Shares; Shareholdings) and  ARTICLE
5.15 (Taxes), which shall be time barred five years after the  Closing Date.
The Limitation Periods shall be tolled (GEHEMMT), if  Purchaser delivers a
notice pursuant to ARTICLE 8.7 (A) even if Purchaser  or a Company then first
proceed to pursue the claim that is subject of such  notice against a third
party.   8.7 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES   (a) In the event of a breach of
a representation, covenant or agreement of  Seller contained in this
Agreement for which Purchaser is eligible to  be indemnified, Purchaser shall
promptly notify Seller of any breach,  describe its claim in reasonable
detail and, to the extent then  feasible, set forth the estimated amount of
such claim (the "CLAIM  DESCRIBED"). Upon delivery of such notice of
Purchaser to Seller, the  expiration, pursuant to ARTICLE 8.6, of the Claim
Described shall be  tolled (GEHEMMT).   (b) In the event that any action,
claim, demand or proceeding under this  Agreement is asserted or announced by
any third party (including any  governmental authority) against Purchaser or
the Hunnebeck Group (the  "CLAIM ADDRESSEE") (any such claim, a "THIRD PARTY
CLAIM"), and in the  event Purchaser intends to demand Seller to indemnify
Purchaser for  such Third Party Claim under this Agreement, Purchaser shall
give, or  cause to be given, by means of a written notice Seller the  
37    opportunity to defend the Claim Addressee against the Third Party 
Claim. If Seller elects to defend the Claim Addressee against the  Third
Party Claim, Seller shall notify Purchaser and the Claim  Addressee in
writing of such decision in due course. Seller then shall  have the right to
defend the Claim Addressee (in consultation with  Purchaser) by all
appropriate actions and shall have, at any time  during the proceedings, the
sole power to direct and control such  defense. In particular, Seller may (in
consultation with Purchaser)  participate in and direct all negotiations and
correspondence with the  third party, appoint and instruct counsel and
request that the Third  Party Claim be litigated or settled in accordance
with Seller\'s  instructions. No action by Seller or its representatives in
connection  with the defense shall be construed as an acknowledgement
(whether  express or implied) of Purchaser\'s claim under this Agreement or
of  any underlying facts related to such claim. All costs and expenses 
incurred by Seller in defending the Third Party Claim shall be borne  by
Seller.   (c) Purchaser agrees, and shall cause each Claim Addressee, (i) to
fully  cooperate with Seller in the defense of any Third Party Claim, (ii)
to  diligently conduct the defense (to the extent that Seller is not in 
control of the defense) in order to mitigate the Loss and keep the  amount
thereof as low as possible, (iii) not to acknowledge or settle  the Third
Party Claim without Seller\'s prior written consent, and (iv)  to provide
Seller\'s representatives access, upon reasonable advance  notice and during
normal business hours, to all relevant books and  records, other information,
premises and personnel of the Hunnebeck  Group (it being understood that
CLAUSES (II) - (IV) of this ARTICLE  8.7(C) shall apply, irrespective of
whether or not Seller has elected  to defend the Third Party Claim). All
costs and expenses incurred by  Purchaser in connection with the cooperation
or defense in accordance  with this ARTICLE 8.7(C) shall be borne by
Purchaser, except for any  Losses to be indemnified by Seller under this
Agreement.   (d) The failure of any Claim Addressee to comply with any of
its  significant obligations under this ARTICLE 8.7 shall release, remise 
and forever discharge Seller from its indemnification obligations  hereunder,
except if (and to the extent that) the Claim Addressee  proves that Seller is
not materially prejudiced by such failure.   8.8 NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OR
REMEDIES   (a) The Parties agree that the rights and remedies which
Purchaser and  Seller may have with respect to the breach of a
representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement or any other provision of
this  Agreement, and under all indemnities contained herein (other than 
Seller\'s obligation to deliver the Sold Shares against   38    payment
of the full Purchase Price), are limited to the rights and  remedies
explicitly contained herein.   (b) Any and all rights and remedies of any
legal nature which Purchaser or  Seller may otherwise have (in addition to
the claims for specific  performance (PRIMARE ERFULLUNGSPFLICHTEN) and the
indemnity claims  explicitly set forth herein) against the other Party in
connection  with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be  excluded and irrevocably waived. In particular, without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives any claims under 
statutory representations and warranties (Sections 434 et seq. of the  German
Civil Code), statutory contractual or precontractual  obligations (Articles
280 to 282, 311 of the German Civil Code) or  frustration of contract
(Section 313 of the German Civil Code) or tort  (Sections 823 et seq. of the
German Civil Code), and no Party shall  have any right to rescind, cancel or
otherwise terminate this  Agreement or exercise any right or remedy which
would have a similar  effect, except for the termination rights set forth in
ARTICLE 4.6.   (c) The provisions of this ARTICLE 8.8 shall not affect any
rights and  remedies of the Parties for fraud or wilful misconduct (VORSATZ)
and  to any claims of Seller arising from a breach of Purchaser\'s 
obligation to pay the Purchase Price in accordance with ARTICLE 2.   8.9 NO
DOUBLE COUNTING   For the avoidance of doubt, matters which have been taken
into account for  the benefit of Purchaser in the calculation of the Purchase
Price pursuant  to Article 2.1 in connection with Article 3, shall in no case
form the  basis for a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE
8.   8.10 INDEMNIFICATION INSURANCE   At Seller\'s option, Seller may, in
the time between the date hereof and the  Closing, purchase one or more
policies of representations and warranties  insurance for the benefit of
Purchaser, including the Maximum Amount and  for the duration of the
Limitation Period, with a deductible equal to the  Deductible Amount, where
any and all out-of pocket expense incurred under  the insurance policy
pursuant to the Deductible Amount will be borne by the  Purchaser
("INDEMNIFICATION INSURANCE"). All provisions of the  Indemnification
Insurance (including, without limitation, the sole and  exclusive nature of
the remedy, the threshold, carve-outs, off-sets, tax  implications and the
exclusion of consequential damages) shall be  consistent in all respects with
this ARTICLE 8. In the event that  Indemnification Insurance is secured as
contemplated by this ARTICLE 8.10,  then   39    notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary,  such
Indemnification Insurance shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of  the
Purchaser for any and all claims arising under this Agreement or  otherwise,
including, without limitation, for any misrepresentation, or any  breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or any other  provision
of this Agreement (other than proven claims for intentional and  knowing
fraud), and such Indemnification Insurance shall be in lieu of, and  not in
addition to, any and all indemnities of Seller hereunder. However,  if the
Indemnification Insurance does not cover Seller\'s liability arising  out of
representations made in ARTICLE 5.2 or ARTICLE 5.15, Seller shall  remain
liable as provided for in ARTICLE 5.2 and ARTICLE 5.15 in connection  with
ARTICLE 8.4 (B) and ARTICLE 8.6.     ARTICLE 9  MISCELLANEOUS  9.1

provision of this  Agreement.   9.8 DEFINITIONS   EXHIBIT 9.8 sets forth
a list of the capitalised terms used in this  Agreement, indicating the Pages
where such terms are defined. Terms defined  in the singular have a
comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice  versa.   43   9.9
SEVERABILITY   Should any provision of this Agreement, or any provision
incorporated into  this Agreement in the future, be or become invalid or
unenforceable, the  validity or enforceability of the other provisions of
this Agreement shall  not be affected thereby. The invalid or unenforceable
provision shall be  deemed to be substituted by a suitable and equitable
provision which, to  the extent legally permissible, comes as close as
possible to the intent  and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable
provision. The same shall  apply: (i) if the Parties have, unintentionally,
failed to address a  certain matter in this Agreement (REGELUNGSLUCKE); in
this case a suitable  and equitable provision shall be deemed to have been
agreed upon which  comes as close as possible to what the Parties, in the
light of the intent  and purpose of this Agreement, would have agreed upon if
they had  considered the matter; or (ii) if any provision of this Agreement
is  invalid because of the scope of any time period or performance
stipulated  herein; in this case a legally permissible time period or
performance shall  be deemed to have been agreed which comes as close as
possible to the  stipulated time period or
performance.                 44   EXHIBIT 9.8: LIST OF
