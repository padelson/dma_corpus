Exchange Agent may reasonably require (including customary indemnity if any
of such certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed), the holder of such Old
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the cash payable pursuant to Section 3.01, which shall be paid
as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within five (5) business
days of the later of the receipt of such materials or the Effective Time. No
interest will be paid on any such cash or other consideration deliverable
pursuant to this Article III upon surrender of Old Certificates. At the
twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Time, any portion of the Exchange

     

   

### 

  

### Fund remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any
dividends or earnings in respect thereof) shall be returned to BBVA. Any
former holders of TRBI Common Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their
Old Certificates for the Per Share Amount pursuant to this Article III shall
thereafter be entitled only to look exclusively to BBVA, and only as general
unsecured creditors thereof, for payment of any Per Share Amount which they
are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Old Certificates pursuant to
this Article III, without any interest thereon.

  

### (c) None of BBVA, Merger Sub, TRBI and the Exchange Agent will be liable
to any former holder of TRBI Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  

3.05. _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised
options to purchase shares of TRBI Common Stock (each, a _"TRBI Stock Option_
"), whether vested or unvested, will cease to represent an option to purchase
TRBI Common Stock and will be converted automatically into the right to
receive in cash, without interest, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, an amount equal to the product of (i) the
excess of the Per Share Amount over the option exercise price and (ii) the
number of shares of TRBI Common Stock subject to the option. Before the
Effective Time, TRBI, or its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee
thereof, shall take all action necessary (to the extent permissible under the
provisions thereof and applicable law) on its part to give effect to the
provisions of this Section 3.05 and shall take such other actions reasonably
requested by BBVA to give effect to this Section 3.05.

  

3.06. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in
this Agreement, shares of TRBI Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who has not voted
such shares in favor of the Merger and who has otherwise taken all of the
steps required by Article 5.12 of the TBCA to properly exercise and perfect
such shareholders dissenters rights (any such shares being referred to
herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be deemed to have ceased to
represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Articles
5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event
that a shareholder of TRBI fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any
such right or remedy granted by the TBCA, the shares of TRBI Common Stock
held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Amount specified in this Agreement. TRBI shall give
BBVA (a) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for
shares of TRBI Common Stock received by TRBI and (b) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands or notices. TRBI shall not, without the prior written
consent of BBVA, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle
or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

warranties contained in Section 5.03 or to one or more of its covenants

warranty of TRBI or BBVA contained in Section 5.03 or Section 5.04 (other

consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with all other

from the Internal Revenue Service covering all tax law changes prior to the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to
the IRS for such letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and it is not aware of any circumstances
reasonably likely to result in loss of qualification of any such Pension Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Each Benefit Arrangement which is intended
to be part of a voluntary employees beneficiary association within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has (A) received an opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service recognizing its exempt status under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely notice with the Internal Revenue
Service pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and it is not aware
of circumstances likely to result in the loss of the exempt status of such
Benefit Arrangement under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. There is no
pending or, to its knowledge, threatened litigation relating to its

  

#### 

     

   



  

#### Benefit Arrangements. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in a transaction with respect to any of its Benefit Arrangements that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject it or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.
Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

  

#### (3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by it or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code
(an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). None of it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a "multiemployer plan", within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time within the last six years. No
notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, other than
pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has
been required to be filed for any of its Pension Plans or by any of its ERISA
Affiliates within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof. No notices
have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code.

  

#### (4) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any of its
Benefit Arrangements have been timely made or have been reflected on its
consolidated financial statements included in its Regulatory Filings. None of
its Pension Plans or any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates
has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none of its
ERISA Affiliates has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates has been required
to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most
recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required
minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will
be increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
of its Pension Plans or to any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA
Affiliates pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  



     

   



  

#### (5) Under each Pension Plan that is a single-employer plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no change in the financial condition of such
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

  

#### (6) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Arrangement, Employment
Agreement or collective bargaining agreement. Either it or its Subsidiaries
may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to
such amendment or termination.

  

#### (7) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or any of its
subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Arrangement which would increase the expense
of maintaining such Benefit Arrangement above the level of the expense
incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither its execution of
this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of the
employment of any of its employees within a specified time of the Effective
Time nor shareholder approval of the transactions covered by this Agreement,
will (A) limit its right, in its sole discretion, to administer or amend in
any respect or terminate any of its Benefit Arrangements or any related
trust, (B) entitle any of its employees or any employees of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay, or (C) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of its
Benefit Arrangements or Employment Agreements. Without limiting the
foregoing, as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including as a result of the termination of the employment of any of
its employees within a specified time of the Effective Time) neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a payment to an individual
that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future.

  

#### (8) All TRBI Stock Options that have been granted under the TRBI Stock
Plans were granted (without giving effect to any amendment

  

#### 

     

   



  

#### thereto) with an exercise price that equaled, at the time of such
grants, at least the fair market value of TRBI Common Stock.

with respect to any of its assets or properties or those of its Subsidiaries,
except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are
being contested in good faith and reserved for in accordance with
GAAP. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any
distribution occurring during the two-year period prior to the date of this

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are exempt from, the
requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate

TRBI has received an opinion of Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc., issued to TRBI,

consents and approvals referred to in Section 5.04(c), the execution,

# **ARTICLE VI**

  

# **COVENANTS**

  

6.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, BBVA and TRBI will each use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with, and furnish
information to, the other party to that end.

  



     

   



  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.01(a), TRBI agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or approval of all
persons party to a Contract with TRBI or any of its Subsidiaries, to the
extent such consent or approval is required in order to consummate the Merger
or for the Surviving Corporation to receive the benefit of such Contract.

  

6.02. _Shareholder Approval_. The TRBI Board will submit to its shareholders
the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and any other matters required
to be approved or adopted by shareholders in order to carry out the
intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, TRBI will
take, in accordance with applicable law, applicable NASDAQ National Market
System rules, the rules of any other relevant exchange and its Constituent
Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders
(including any adjournment or postponement, the _"TRBI Meeting_ "), as
promptly as practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of the plan
of merger as well as any other such matters. Except as specifically provided
in the second succeeding sentence below, the TRBI Board will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving the
plan of merger contained in this Agreement, including providing an
unqualified recommendation that its shareholders vote in favor of the Merger.
Unless the Agreement has previously been terminated pursuant to Article VIII,
TRBI shall be obligated to hold the TRBI Meeting notwithstanding any
Acquisition Proposal or other event or circumstance, and TRBI agrees that it
will not submit any Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders for a vote.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, if
the TRBI Board, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel,
determines in good faith that, because of the receipt by TRBI of an
Acquisition Proposal that the TRBI Board concludes in good faith constitutes
a Superior Proposal, it would more likely than not result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the plan
of merger set forth in this Agreement, then, in submitting the plan of merger
to the TRBI Meeting, the TRBI Board may submit the plan of merger to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the TRBI Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_
that the TRBI Board __ may not take any actions under this sentence until
after giving BBVA at least 10 business days to respond to such Acquisition
Proposal (and after giving BBVA notice of the latest material terms,
conditions and identity of the third party in the Acquisition Proposal) and
then taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by BBVA.

  

6.03. _Proxy Statement._ (a)  TRBI will prepare a proxy statement for the
TRBI Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents. Each party
will cooperate, and will cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other
party, its counsel and its accountants, in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto, the solicitation of
proxies and preparation for the TRBI Meeting, and, provided that BBVA and its
Subsidiaries have cooperated in such manner as to permit it to do so,

  



     

   



  

TRBI agrees to file the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto with the SEC within the time required to permit the TRBI Meeting to
be held as promptly as reasonably practicable and the Closing to occur in a
timely manner. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment to the Proxy
Statement prior to filing it with the SEC.

  

### (b) Each of BBVA and TRBI agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the
time of the TRBI Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
such statement was made, not misleading. BBVA and TRBI each further agrees
that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any
of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy
Statement.

  

6.04. _Press Releases_. BBVA and TRBI will consult with each other before
issuing any press release, written employee communication or other written
shareholder communication with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
will not issue any such communication or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ that a party may, without the prior consent of
the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in
the circumstances), issue such communication or make such public statement as
may be required by applicable law or securities exchange rules, provided,
however, that such party shall immediately inform the other party of the
issuance of such public communication or the making of such public statement.
BBVA and TRBI will cooperate to develop all public communications and make
appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party.

  

6.05. _Access; Information_. (a) TRBI agrees that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it will
(and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford BBVA, and BBVAs officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives, such
access during normal business hours to TRBIs books, records (including,
without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors),
properties, personnel and to such other information as BBVA may reasonably
request and TRBI will furnish promptly to BBVA (1) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as BBVA may
reasonably request. BBVA will use its best efforts to exercise such right of
access in such manner as to not disrupt the normal

  



     

   



  

business activities of TRBI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TRBI shall not be
required to afford access or disclose information that would cause TRBI to
forfeit the right to assert the attorney-client privilege in any pending or
threatened proceeding.

  

### (b) A will hold any information which is nonpublic and confidential to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement
between BBVA and TRBI, dated May 12, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
").

  

### (c) No investigation by BBVA of the business and affairs of TRBI,
pursuant to this Section 6.05 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to BBVAs obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

6.06. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) TRBI will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal, _provided_  that, in the event TRBI receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal, including from an Other Person
(as defined below) after the execution of this Agreement, and the TRBI Board
concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, TRBI may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the TRBI Board concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of
counsel) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_
_further,_  that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
it than the Confidentiality Agreement (without regard to any modification
thereof pursuant hereto). TRBI will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than BBVA (" _Other Persons_
") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable
best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to
an Acquisition Proposal. TRBI will promptly (within 24 hours) advise
BBVA following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance
thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep BBVA apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

  

### (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent TRBI or the TRBI
Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in
no 

  

### 

     

   

### 

  

### way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

6.07. _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. TRBI will not take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Voting Agreements
to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and TRBI will take
all reasonably necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary and
reasonable to do so, to challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. TRBI will not take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and TRBI will take all necessary
steps within its control to make those transactions comply with (or continue
to comply with) any Takeover Provisions. BBVA will not purchase shares of
TRBI Common Stock representing 5% or more of the outstanding shares of TRBI
Common Stock.

  

6.08. _Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents_. (a) Each of BBVA and
TRBI and their respective Subsidiaries will use all reasonable best efforts
to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings
and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ ") that are
required to be effected or obtained by it, and of all other third
parties from which it is required to obtain consents (the " _Third-
Party Consents_ "), necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and, and will make all necessary filings in respect of
those Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Third-Party Consents for which it is
responsible as soon as practicable. Each of BBVA and TRBI will have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with
the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, with respect to all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Third-Party Consents. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other party with
respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and each party
will keep the other party appraised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

### (b) A and TRBI will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party will cooperate with the other party and will
assist the other party as reasonably requested to permit the other party to
obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Third-Party Consents to be
obtained by the other party.

6.09. _No Rights Triggered._ TRBI shall take all reasonable steps necessary
to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the Voting Agreements
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
any other action or combination of actions, or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, do not and will not result in the grant of
any Rights to any person (a) under TRBIs Constituent Documents or (b) under
any material Contract to which TRBI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
except, in each case, as Previously Disclosed or contemplated by this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

6.11. _Indemnification_. (a) Following the Effective Time and for a period

hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of
TRBI and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") as
incurred, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), to the full extent as such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant
to the Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in
effect on the date of this Agreement with TRBI and its Subsidiaries.

  

### (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will use all reasonable best efforts to provide directors and
officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of TRBI or any of their respective Subsidiaries with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage
and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by TRBI; _provided_
that (1) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
more than 200 percent of the current amount expended by TRBI to maintain or
procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; (2) if the cost
thereof exceeds the threshold of subparagraph (1) or if the Surviving
Corporation is otherwise unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 6.11(b), the Surviving Corporation will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is
reasonably available at a cost of not more than 200 percent of the current
amount expended by TRBI to maintain or procure such directors and officers
insurance coverage;

  

### 

     

   



  

### and (3) officers and directors of TRBI or any Subsidiary may be required
to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
the Surviving Corporation s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance.

  

### (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that failure so to notify will not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.11(a) unless and to
the extent that the Surviving Corporation is actually and materially
prejudiced as a consequence.

  

### (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

  

6.12. _Employee Matters_. (a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide the
employees of TRBI and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "
_Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits and compensation plans,

to the employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements
provided by TRBI or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (1) provide all Covered Employees
with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and
levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan), under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement (including vacation and sick days) adopted, maintained or
contributed to by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all periods of
employment with TRBI or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent credited by TRBI for
purposes of a comparable plan in which the applicable Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) cause
any pre-existing conditions, limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to
the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived
under the corresponding plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in which
the

  

### 

     

   



  

### applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  

### (c) As of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, TRBI shall
terminate or cause to be terminated, to the extent permissible under the
provisions thereof and applicable law, the 401(k) Plan and the ESOP.

  

6.13. _Notification of Certain Matters_. BBVA and TRBI will give notice
promptly, but in any event within 24 hours, to the other of any fact, event
or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or
taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause
or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be expected to
give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in
Article VII.

  

6.14. _Certain Modifications_. BBVA and TRBI shall consult with respect to
TRBIs loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications and levels of reserves) and TRBI shall make
such modifications or changes to its policies and practices, if any, and at
such date prior to the Effective Time, as may be mutually agreed upon. No
partys representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a
consequence of any modifications or changes to such policies and practices
which may be undertaken on account of this Section 6.14.

  

6.15. _Formation of Merger Sub_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, BBVA shall cause Merger Sub to be duly organized as a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of BBVA and to become a party to this Agreement by executing

the Merger Sub Board of Directors and the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to
approve the Merger and the consummation of the transactions described in this

Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX will survive termination of
this Agreement.

  

8.03. _Termination Fee._ (a)  As a condition of BBVA and Merger Subs
willingness, and in order to induce BBVA and Merger Sub, to enter into this

this Agreement its recommendation that the shareholders of TRBI adopt this

or (B) pursuant to Section 8.01(e), in the event TRBIs failure to comply
with any provision of this Agreement has been the primary cause of the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date, or (C)
pursuant to Section 8.01(f), in the event TRBIs failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement has been the primary cause of the denial of any
approval referred to in such Section 8.01(f) and, within 18 months after any
of the events described in (A), (B) or (C), an event described in Section
8.03(a)(1) or Section 8.03(a)(2) occurs.

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
are cumulative with, and not intended to limit, other remedies that may
be available, and that, without these agreements, BBVA would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if TRBI fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, BBVA
commences a suit which results in a judgment against TRBI for the payment set
forth in this Section 8.03, TRBI shall reimburse BBVAs costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03 from

payment was required to be made.

  



     

   



  

### (d) TRBI shall notify BBVA promptly in writing of the occurrence of any
Fee Payment Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by TRBI
shall not be a condition to BBVAs rights pursuant to this Section 8.03.

  

### (e) For purposes hereof, a " _Fee Termination Event"_ is any one of the
following: (1) the Effective Time, or (2) the expiration of eighteen (18)
months following termination of this Agreement.

9.07. _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Voting Agreements represent the entire understanding of BBVA and TRBI
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all
other oral or written agreements previously made or purported to be
made, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. No representation, warranty,
inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this
Agreement has been made or relied on by any party in entering into this
Agreement. Except for Section 6.11, which is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties to the extent stated, nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any person other than BBVA, Merger Sub and TRBI.

  



  

9.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part
(except by operation of law), by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of each other party hereto, except that BBVA and Merger Sub
may assign or delegate in their sole discretion any or all of their rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of BBVA, but no such assignment shall relieve BBVA of
any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

9.09. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. All of the parties hereto irrevocably waive any
and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

9.10. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions,
or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it has been held

  



     

   



  

invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and will in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the
parties will negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable
and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the
parties.

  



  

9.11. _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, before the
Effective Time, BBVA may revise the structure of the Merger or
otherwise revise the method of effecting the Merger and related transactions,
in a manner acceptable to TRBI, approval of or consent to which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, _provided_ that (1) such revision does not
alter or change the kind or amount of consideration to be delivered to the
shareholders of TRBI and the holders of TRBI Stock Options, (2) such revision
does not adversely affect the tax consequences to the shareholders of TRBI,
(3) such revised structure or method is reasonably capable of consummation
without significant delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein,
and (4) such revision does not otherwise cause any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof). This Agreement and any
related documents will be appropriately amended in order to reflect any such
revised structure or method.
