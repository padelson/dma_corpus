of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub:

  



  

### (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_ and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, without interest.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change.

  

### 

  

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

  



  

### (a) At the Effective Time, each option or similar right (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under any Company Equity
Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall
pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each former holder of any
such canceled Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days thereafter) an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option; provided, that if the exercise price per Share of any
such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit or similar right
(each, a " _Company RSU_ ") to purchase Shares granted under any Company
Equity Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor,
Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each former
holder of each such canceled Company RSU as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration per Share underlying such Company RSU. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Merger Consideration shall be payable with respect to any
Company RSU to the extent Shares shall have been issued thereunder prior to
the Effective Time, and such Company RSU shall have no force and effect
following the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and make all amendments, if any, to
the terms of the Company Equity Plans and each outstanding Company Stock
Option and Company RSU award agreement, and shall take all other actions
within its control that are necessary to give effect to the provisions of
this _Section 3.2_.

  

### 

  

Section 3.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

  



  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement
with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent for the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
the Company Stockholders shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and
_Section 3.2._ As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and
in any event not later than the first Business Day thereafter, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to make all payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").  The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
due pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_, except as provided in this
Agreement.  Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other
amounts contemplated by _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_.

  

### 

  

### (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of (i) an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, in each case, were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_, (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and
such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the

  



        
   

  



  

### holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share. In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock
power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.3_, each share represented by a Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable in respect of each Share theretofore represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to  _Section
3.1(a)_, without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (c) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
 At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares,
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent in investments that are customary for transactions of
similar nature and size as the Merger. If for any reason (including
investment losses) the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully
satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent
hereunder (but subject to _Section 3.4_), Parent shall promptly deposit (or
cause to be deposited) cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (e) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares.

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_.  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is or are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to

Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after Appropriate Consultation, that such Acquisition Proposal

a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal).

tender offer or exchange offer), or from (ii) making any required disclosure
to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose such
information would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under
applicable Law.

### (e) Unless such actions are taken in connection with a termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, the Company shall
not take any action to approve any transaction under, or any Third Party

#### 

  

#### (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (provided

more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares than
the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal, and this Agreement, (B) that, in the good faith reasonable judgment
of the Company Board, after Appropriate Consultation, is reasonably capable
of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal, and (C) is not subject to any due diligence
condition.

before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such policy, including the amount to be paid therefor,
shall be subject to approval by Parent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If such prepaid tail

  



        
   

  



  

### policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations of the Company thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action
(whether arising prior to, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted
against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.12_ shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such Action.

  

### 

  

### (e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section
6.12_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, expressly are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives.

  

### 

  

### (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12_.

  

### 

  

Section 6.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.14 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases issued by
each party announcing this Agreement will be in a form that is mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and
give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any public announcement prior to such consultation
and review, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_.  If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent will not and will cause its
Affiliates not to, for a period of three (3) years thereafter, without the
prior written consent of the Company, solicit (other than a solicitation by
general advertisement) any person who is an employee of the Company, at the
date hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such termination, to
terminate his or her employment with the Company. Parent agrees that any
remedy at law for any breach by Parent

  



        
   

  



  

(whether in connection with its own actions or those of its Affiliates) of
this _Section 6.15_ would be inadequate, and that the Company would be
entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this
restriction on Parent is too onerous and is not necessary for the protection
of the Company, Parent agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may
impose such lesser restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary
or appropriate to properly protect the Company.

  



  

Section 6.16 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Action against the Company and its directors relating to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent shall not be obligated
to consent to any settlement which does not include full release of Parent
and its Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief
upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation).

  



  

Section 6.18 _Closing Cash and Related Matters_.  The Company agrees that (a)
it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its cash and cash
equivalents at and after November 30, 2009 to be not less than $2,950,000
(reduced by the payment after the date hereof of any expenses of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and (b) except as otherwise agreed by
Parent in its sole discretion, at and as of the Closing the Company shall
have no indebtedness for borrowed money and its assets shall not be subject
to any Liens relating to indebtedness for borrowed money.

  



  

Section 6.19 _Title Policies_. The Company shall obtain policies of title
insurance in an amount not less than $5,000,000 insuring the Companys fee
simple title to the Owned Real Property, subject only to standard exceptions
expressly not to include any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or failure of such party to perform or
comply with the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the

notice of such breach or failure to perform, and (C) has not been waived by
the Company;

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.  In the event of termination in
accordance with this _Article VIII_, this Agreement shall forthwith become

Announcements), this _Section 8.2_,  _Section 8.3_ (Fees and Expenses) and
_Article IX_ (General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive the
termination hereof; provided, however, that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company shall be released from any liabilities or damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the
bargain lost by a party or a partys stockholders, taking into consideration
relevant matters, including other combination opportunities, the time value
of money and the decrease in the market value of the Shares, which shall be
deemed in such event to be damages of such party) arising out of a breach of

termination in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

### (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and

### (b) In the event that

  

### 

  

#### (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_, (A) due to a delay resulting solely from the actions of the

announced, commenced, submitted or made, and not withdrawn at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Parent terminates the Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_,
and

  

#### 

  

#### in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) above, within twelve (12)
months after such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, with a Third Party, or

  

### 

  

#### (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_, or

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_,

  

#### 

  

#### then, in the case of any of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal
to $4,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ").  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to (A) _Sections 8.1(b)(i)_ or _8.1(d)(i)_ in the
circumstances contemplated in _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ or _(ii)_ above, or (B)
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or  _(d)(iii)_.

### (c) Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent

to occur of the entering into of such definitive agreement and consummation
of such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in the circumstances described in _Section
8.3(b) _(iii)__ , prior to or simultaneously with and as a condition to the
termination, and (iii) in the circumstances described in _Section 8.3(b)
_(iv)__ , promptly (but in no event later than one Business Day) following
termination.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that
the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges
and hereby agrees that the provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.

  

### 

  

Section 8.4 _Frustration of Conditions_.  The right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or  _8.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be
available if the failure of the party so requesting termination for failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of
the failure of such condition to be satisfied on or prior to such date.

State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to
commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts
described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described

  



        
   

  



  

herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Assignment; Successors_.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
provided, however, that each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Enforcement_.  The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of the Company (on behalf of itself and on behalf of the
holders of Shares as third-party beneficiaries under clause (d) of _Section
9.5_), Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case,
in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate
and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Severability_.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of any other provision of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full
force and effect and in lieu of such invalid or unenforceable provision there
shall be automatically added as part of this Agreement a valid and
enforceable provision as similar in terms to the invalid or unenforceable
provision as possible, provided that this Agreement as amended, (i) reflects
the intent of the parties hereto, and (ii) does not change the bargained for
consideration or benefits to be received by each party hereto.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.  EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Facsimile or PDF Signature_.  This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or PDF signature and a facsimile or PDF signature shall constitute
an original for all purposes.

  



  

Section 9.16 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_.  Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
expressly waived.
