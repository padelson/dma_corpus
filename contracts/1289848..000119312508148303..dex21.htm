material developments concerning resolution of such dispute. If any addition
to the Purchase Price is made pursuant to _Section 2.8_, the amount of such
addition will be allocated by the Purchaser among the Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Allocation. Purchaser and Seller agree
to file any additional Tax Return required to be filed pursuant to Section
1060 of the Code or other applicable Law.

purposes, the parties intend to treat the Contingent Payment Value right as a
cash settlement put option issued as part of an investment unit comprised of
such right and the Parent Common Stock comprising the Share Consideration
delivered to Seller at Closing, which unit shall be deemed to have a fair
market value determined as of the Closing Date equal to $35 million. For the
avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, no portion of any payments made by
Purchaser under the Contingent Payment Value right shall be treated as
additional Purchase Price hereunder.

2.7 _Working Capital Adjustment_. (a) Within 180 days of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller an unaudited statement of the Net Closing
Date Working Capital of Seller (the " _Preliminary Net Working Capital
Statement_ "). The Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with _Schedule 1.1G_.

(b) Within 45 days after March 31, 2009, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Updated Working Capital Statement_ ") of Net Closing Date
Working Capital of Seller prepared in accordance with _Schedule 1.1G_ (the "
_Updated Net Closing Date Working Capital_ ").



 

21 (c) Seller shall have 30 days after delivery of each of the Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement and Updated Working Capital Statement by Purchaser
to review the same, and to propose any adjustments thereto. During such
period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with reasonable access to the books and
records of Purchaser which are reasonably related to the Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement or Updated Working Capital Statement, as applicable.
All adjustments proposed by Seller shall be set out in a written statement
delivered to Purchaser (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") and shall be
incorporated into the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement or Updated
Working Capital Statement, as applicable, except for such proposed adjustments
to which Purchaser objects within 20 days of delivery thereof to Purchaser.
The failure of Seller to deliver such Adjustment Statement within said 30-day
period will constitute Sellers acceptance of the Preliminary Net Working
Capital Statement or Updated Working Capital Statement, as applicable,
as prepared by Purchaser. If Purchaser objects to the Adjustment Statement
within said 20-day period (the adjustments to which Purchaser objects being
referred to herein as the " _Contested Adjustments_ "), Purchaser and Seller
shall attempt to resolve the dispute regarding the Contested Adjustments. If
a final resolution thereof is not reached within ten Business Days of Sellers
receipt of Purchasers objections thereto, either Purchaser or Seller shall
thereafter be entitled to refer any remaining Contested Adjustments to a
nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to Purchaser and Seller or,
in the absence of agreement on the accounting firm within 5 days of notice by
either Purchaser or Seller of intent to initiate such a referral, to Grant
Thornton LLP (the firm so engaged, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). If
there is a referral to the Independent Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser and
Seller agree, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, to execute a
reasonable engagement letter and shall submit to the Independent Accounting
Firm not later than ten Business Days after its appointment, a written
statement summarizing its position on the Contested Adjustments, together
with such supporting documentation as it deems necessary. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
materials submitted and presentations by Purchaser and Seller, and not
by independent review, only the Contested Adjustments that have not been
settled by negotiation and shall be instructed to render its decision within
45 days of its appointment or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable.
The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm as to the Contested
Adjustments shall be final and binding on, and shall not be subject to appeal
by, Purchaser or Seller, and may be entered and enforced by any court having
jurisdiction. The Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement shall be revised
as necessary to reflect the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm, and
the other modifications thereto previously agreed by Purchaser and Seller (the
Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement, as so adjusted, being referred to
herein as the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ ," and the
Updated Working Capital Statement, as so adjusted, being referred to herein as
the " _Final Updated Working Capital Statement_ "). Each of Purchaser and
Seller shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the resolution
of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or the Final Updated
Working Capital Statement, as applicable, and the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand.

(d) The Initial Purchase Price shall be (i) increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount, if any, that the Net Closing Date Working Capital
reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement exceeds the
Base Working Capital Amount or (ii) decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
the amount, if any, that the Net Closing Date  



 

22  Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement is less than the Base Working Capital Amount. Purchaser agrees to
pay Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Seller in writing at least one Business Day prior to such wire
transfer the amount of any excess determined in accordance with clause (i)
above, if any, and the Shareholders and Seller agree to pay Purchaser by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Purchaser
in writing at least one Business Day prior to such wire transfer the amount of
any deficiency determined in accordance with clause (ii) above, if any, in
each case, within three Business Days after the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement is finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_.

(e) The Initial Purchase Price shall be (i) increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount, if any, that the Updated Net Closing Date Working
Capital reflected on the Final Updated Working Capital Statement exceeds the
Net Closing Date Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement or (ii) decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
the amount, if any, that the Updated Net Closing Date Working Capital
reflected on the Final Updated Working Capital Statement is less than the Net
Closing Date Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement. Purchaser agrees to pay Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by Seller in writing at
least one Business Day prior to such wire transfer the amount of any excess
determined in accordance with clause (i) above, if any, and the Shareholders
and Seller agree to pay Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by Seller in writing at least one Business Day
prior to such wire transfer the amount of any deficiency determined in
accordance with clause (ii) above, if any, in each case, within three Business
Days after the Final Updated Working Capital Statement is finally determined
in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_.

2.8 _Earn-Out Payments_. (a) As additional consideration for the sale of the
Assets by Seller to Purchaser, for the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on December 31, 2011 (the " _Earn-Out Period_ "), Purchaser shall
pay to Seller (to an account specified by Seller in writing at least one
Business Day prior to the date the payment for the 2008 Calculation Period is
due) with respect to each Calculation Period within the Earn-Out Period an
amount, if any, (each, an " _Earn-Out Payment_ ") equal to (i)(A) the EBITDA
Amount for such Calculation Period, minus (B) the EBITDA Threshold for
such Calculation Period; multiplied by (ii) the Earn-Out Multiple for such
Calculation Period.

(b) (i) Within 90 days of the end of each Calculation Period (or 120 days in
the case of the final Calculation Period), Purchaser shall prepare a statement
setting forth Purchasers calculation of the amount of the Earn-Out Payment
that is due with respect to such Calculation Period (each, an " _Earn-Out
Calculation Statement_ "). Concurrently with the delivery of each Earn-Out
Calculation Statement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of the Earn-
Out Payment reflected thereon by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account specified by Seller in writing pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_.



 

23 (ii) Seller shall have 30 days after delivery of the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement by Purchaser to review the same, and to propose any adjustments
thereto. During such period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with reasonable
access to the books and records of Purchaser which are reasonably related to
the Earn-Out Calculation Statement. All adjustments proposed by Seller shall
be set out in a written statement delivered to Purchaser (the " _Earn-Out
Adjustment Statement_ ") and shall be incorporated into the Earn-Out
Calculation Statement, except for such proposed adjustments to which
Purchaser objects within 20 days of delivery thereof to Purchaser. The failure
of Seller to deliver such Earn-Out Adjustment Statement within said 30-day
period will constitute Sellers acceptance of the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement as prepared by Purchaser. If Purchaser objects to the Earn-Out
Adjustment Statement within said 20-day period (the adjustments to which
Purchaser objects being referred to herein as the " _Contested Earn-
Out Adjustments_ "), Purchaser and Seller shall attempt to resolve the
dispute regarding the Contested Earn-Out Adjustments. If a final resolution
thereof is not reached within ten Business Days of Sellers receipt of
Purchasers objections thereto, either Purchaser or Seller shall thereafter
be entitled to refer any remaining Contested Earn-Out Adjustments to a
nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to Purchaser and Seller or,
in the absence of agreement on the accounting firm within 5 days of notice by
either Purchaser or Seller of intent to initiate such a referral, to Grant
Thornton LLP. If there is such a referral to an independent accounting firm,
each of Purchaser and Seller agree, if requested by the independent
accounting firm, to execute a reasonable engagement letter and shall submit to
the independent accounting firm not later than ten Business Days after its
appointment, a written statement summarizing its position on the
Contested Earn-Out Adjustments, together with such supporting documentation
as it deems necessary. The independent accounting firm shall act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on the materials submitted and
presentations by Purchaser and Seller, and not by independent review, only
the Contested Earn-Out Adjustments that have not been settled by negotiation
and shall be instructed to render its decision within 45 days of its
appointment or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. The decision
of the independent accounting firm as to the Contested Adjustments shall be
final and binding on, and shall not be subject to appeal by, Purchaser or
Seller, and may be entered and enforced by any court having jurisdiction. The
Earn-Out Calculation Statement shall be revised as necessary to reflect the
decision of the independent accounting firm, and the other modifications
thereto previously agreed by Purchaser and Seller, and any payments required
to be made as a result thereof shall be paid within three Business Days of
the final determination by the independent accounting firm. Each of Purchaser
and Seller shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
resolution of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement, and the fees and expenses
of the independent accounting firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand. Seller and Shareholders agree
that all Earn-Out Payments made to Seller shall be distributed in
accordance with _Schedule 2.8(b)(ii)_.

(iii) During the Earn-Out Period, appropriate measures will be taken by
Purchaser to ensure that the Stockamp Practice generates separate financial
statements sufficient to allow the Earn-Out Payments to be calculated and
reviewed in accordance with this Agreement.



 

24 (c) (i) Parent agrees that during the Earn-Out Period, the Stockamp Practice
will be included within the Parents Healthcare Division but shall be managed
as a separate business unit. During the Earn-Out Period, either the Seller
Representative or another individual designated by Parents Chief Executive
Officer and reasonably acceptable to Seller will serve as the practice leader
of the Stockamp Practice. During the Earn-Out Period, Parent will give either
the Seller Representative or another individual designated by Parents Chief
Executive Officer and reasonably acceptable to Seller authority, subject to
the approval of Parents Vice President, Healthcare (currently David Shade)
and Parents Chief Executive Officer, which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld, to conduct the Stockamp Practice in the
ordinary course, including approval of an annual budget for the Stockamp
Practice (" _Stockamp Budget_ ") and authority to (A) engage and dismiss
personnel or outside contractors working for the Stockamp Practice, (B)
determine and adjust base and bonus compensation of employees of the Stockamp
Practice, and (C) determine the pricing terms of engagement with clients of
the Stockamp Practice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if in any Calculation
Period in respect to which bonus compensation is proposed to be paid to
employees of the Stockamp Practice, the Stockamp Practice shall not have
achieved both (i) a Gross Margin Amount for such Calculation Period that
is greater than the Target Gross Margin for such Calculation Period and (ii)
the EBITDA Bonus Target for such Calculation Period, any bonus compensation to
personnel of the Stockamp Practice attributable solely to Stockamp Practice or
corporate performance (but excluding any portion of bonus compensation
attributable to individual performance) shall require the express approval of
the Chief Executive Officer of Parent or his designee.

(ii) Parent agrees that if for any Calculation Period (excluding the 2008
Calculation Period) the Stockamp Practice achieves both (i) a Gross Margin
Amount for such Calculation Period that is greater than the Bonus Target Gross
Margin for such Calculation Period and (ii) the EBITDA Target for such
Calculation Period, the practice leader of the Stockamp Practice shall have
authority to determine an aggregate amount of non-budgeted discretionary bonus
compensation to be paid to employees of the Stockamp Practice (the "
_Aggregate Gross Margin Bonus_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Aggregate Gross Margin Bonus for a Calculation Period exceed the
Gross Margin Bonus Pool for such Calculation Period.

(iii) Parent agrees that, during the Earn-Out Period, (1) effective January 1,
2009, the Stockamp Practice will have the exclusive right to conduct Parents
Business, and all of Parents employees engaged in Parents Business as of
December 31, 2008 will be reassigned to the Stockamp Practice (reporting to
the Stockamp Practice leader) and (2) Parent will direct exclusively all
potential clients of the Business to, and otherwise use commercially
reasonable efforts to promote the Stockamp Practice, including introductions
of Stockamp Practice personnel to client executives or contacts of other
Parent practices with potential engagement opportunities related to
the Business, with the understanding that, with respect to all potential
engagement opportunities unrelated to the Business but related to other Parent
practices, the Stockamp Practice will direct its clients to, and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to promote, such Parent practices.



 

25 (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.8_ to the contrary,
the operation of the Stockamp Practice shall at all times be subject to the
oversight of Parents Chief Executive Officer or his designee and to the
general accounting, financial reporting, legal, information technology, human
resources and other generally applicable polices and practices of Parent.

(v) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide the Stockamp Practice
with the services identified on _Schedule 2.8(c)(v)_ (" _Corporate Services_
") in a commercially reasonable manner (and, at minimum, at the same level of
availability, quality and responsiveness as Parent provides its other
practices), for which Parent shall assume all costs without reimbursement from
the Stockamp Practice.

(vi) The Stockamp Practice may continue to use the name "Stockamp and
Associates" immediately following the Closing and for a period ending December
31, 2009. After December 31, 2009, the name under which the Stockamp
Practice shall operate shall be determined by Purchaser in its sole
discretion.

(vii) In the event that Parent intends to (A) acquire a business that it will
integrate with, or which is competitive with the Business of, the Stockamp
Practice or (B) effect a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer, directly or
indirectly, in one transaction or a series of related transactions undertaken
with a common purpose, of the Stockamp Practice or Parents Business, or of
all or substantially all of the assets thereof, (any of the foregoing, a "
_Fundamental Change_ "), Parent shall notify Seller promptly of such
Fundamental Change, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to adjust
the EBITDA Thresholds, EBITDA Targets, Bonus Target Gross Margin or other
provisions of this _Section 2.8_ as necessary to preserve the original
intent hereof and to maintain Sellers ability to earn the additional
consideration contemplated hereby in light of the Fundamental Change.

(viii) During any Calculation Period, without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not transfer,
solicit to hire or engage, or hire or engage, any employee of Parents
Business to work in any business of Parent other than the Stockamp Practice.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not in any way limit
Purchasers or Parents internal or external communications
regarding employment opportunities as long as such communications are not
specifically targeted at employees of Parents Business.

(ix) If on January 1, 2009, (A) either of the persons listed on _Schedule
2.8(c)(ix)_ is no longer employed by Parent or one of its Affiliates or, if so
employed, not assigned to the Stockamp Practice (reporting to the Stockamp
Practice leader), or (B) more than 25% of the employees of Parent and its
Affiliates engaged primarily in Parents Business on the Closing Date are
either no longer employed by Parent or one of its Affiliates or, if so
employed, not assigned to the Stockamp Practice  



 

26  (reporting to the Stockamp Practice leader) excluding any such employee that
has been replaced by Parent and its Affiliates at or prior to January
1, 2009, the parties shall promptly meet to evaluate the impact of such
circumstances on the Stockamp Practices capacity to achieve the EBITDA
Thresholds for the remaining Calculation Periods. If the parties agree that,
in light of the circumstances described in the preceding sentence,
adjustments to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ are necessary to preserve
the original intent hereof, the parties will negotiate in good faith to adjust
such provisions to maintain Sellers ability to earn the additional
consideration contemplated hereby.

_SELLER AND SHAREHOLDERS RELATING TO SELLER_  

Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules (it being understood that each
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules shall qualify other sections or
subsections of this _Article IV_ to which such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face to be applicable, and shall be deemed to be incorporated
in any such other schedule of the Disclosure Schedules), Shareholders and

Judgment applicable to Seller or by which Seller or any of its assets or

Statements (i) have been prepared from, are in accordance with and accurately
reflect the accrual-basis books and records of Seller, (ii) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis

subject to normal year end adjustments, none of which are, individually or in
the aggregate, material, and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects,
the financial condition of Seller as of such dates and the results of
operations and cash flows of Seller for such periods. Seller has no material
Liabilities and is not a guarantor, indemnitor, surety or other obligor of any

relating to, the business and operations of Seller held by Seller. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ , such Permits are valid and in full force and
effect and Seller is not and has not been in default under  



 

30  any Permit and no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute default under the Permits. None of such Permits will,
assuming the related Required Consents have been obtained, be terminated, be
impaired, become terminable or otherwise be affected as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements. Seller
has all Permits required to conduct its Business and Seller is and has been
operating its Business pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of all
such Permits in all material respects.

4.10 _Litigation; Judgments_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.10_ , there
are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, (a)
involving Seller (or any of Sellers officers, directors, employees or agents
in their capacity as such), (b) with respect to which there is a reasonable
likelihood of a determination which, individually or in the aggregate, would
materially hinder or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (c) that seek to enjoin or obtain damages in respect of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller
has not received notice from a Person asserting facts or circumstances which
are reasonably likely to give rise to the initiation of a Proceeding against
Seller. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.10_, Seller is not subject to any
Judgment, and Seller has not entered into any agreement to settle or
compromise any Proceeding pending or threatened against it that has involved
any obligation other than the payment of money for which Seller has no
continuing obligation.

4.11 _Engagements; Pre-Closing Clients_. (a) Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.11(a)_ , all services provided by Seller under the Completed Engagements,
In-Process Engagements and Support Engagements have in all material respects
been in conformity with all applicable contractual commitments and standards
of care and all express and implied warranties under the Completed
Engagements, In-Process Engagements and Support Engagements.

(b) _Schedule 4.11(b)_ is a true, correct and complete list of the Pre-
Closing Clients since January 1, 2005 and Support Clients as of the date of
this Agreement. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver an updated _Schedule

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser shall not be responsible for any Taxes imposed on or measured

preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms relating to the

Laws in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

promptly after receipt (in cash or as an offset against other current Tax
liabilities of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof).

or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment, effective as of the Closing

the same level of base salary or wages at which he or she is currently
employed by Seller and on such other terms and conditions as determined by
Parent (subject to the terms and conditions of this  _Section 6.7_). All
such Seller Employees who accept Parents offer of employment as of the
Closing Date and who become employed by Parent or one of its Affiliates
effective as of the Closing Date shall be referred to herein as the "
_Transferred Employees_." Any Seller Employee who does not accept Parents
offer of employment and become a Transferred Employee shall remain the

Closing Date, continue to make available to Transferred Employees such plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements (other than the Seller Flex Plan and

employee benefits which are substantially equivalent to the benefits provided
to Transferred Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to Parent in
cash, or the Purchase Price shall be reduced by, an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between (i) the total amount contributed to the
Seller Flex Plan by participants in the plan (through payroll deductions or
otherwise) for the period beginning on January 1 of the year which the Closing
Date occurs and ending on the Closing Date (the " _Coverage Period_ "), and
(ii) the total payments from the Seller Flex Plan for the Coverage Period
(determined as of the Closing Date), but in no event less than zero.

(f) Parent will (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any welfare plan that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing, other than
limitations on preexisting conditions that are already in effect with respect
to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing
under any welfare plan maintained for Sellers Employees immediately prior
the Closing, and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing to satisfy any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans
that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing to the
same extent as if those deductibles or co-payments had been paid under the
welfare plans for which such employees are eligible after the Closing.

(g) Effective immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all
actions that are necessary or appropriate to terminate the Stockamp and
Associates, Inc. Retirement Plan and Trust (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ").
Parent shall give the Transferred Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but for no other purpose) under the Huron Consulting
Group Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Huron 401(k) Plan_ ") for such
Transferred Employees service with Seller to the same extent recognized by
Seller for purposes of eligibility under the Seller 401(k) Plan immediately
prior to the Closing and Transferred Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the Huron 401(k) Plan from and after the Closing Date, subject
to the terms and conditions of the Huron 401(k) Plan. Transferred Employees

51  from the Seller 401(k) Plan shall, subject to the provisions of section 402
of the Code, be permitted to make a rollover contribution to the Huron
401(k) Plan in accordance with the terms of the Huron 401(k) Plan. To the
extent that, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.7(g)_, a
Transferred Employee is eligible to make a rollover contribution of a direct
rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 401(a)(31) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) to the Huron 401(k) Plan, such rollover
contribution may include promissory notes for loans made to such Transferred
Employee under the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan.

Purchaser, or any Affiliate of Purchaser which may employ the Shareholders,
which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) If at any time any of the provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being vague or
unreasonable as to duration, area, scope of activity or otherwise, then this
_Section 6.8_ shall be considered divisible (with the other provisions to
remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or unenforceable  



 

52  provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended to include
only such time, area, scope of activity and other restrictions, as shall
be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body
having jurisdiction over the matter, and each Shareholder expressly agrees
that this _Section 6.8_, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as though

pursuant to _Section 9.1_, neither Shareholders, Seller, nor any of their
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
Affiliates or other agents shall, directly or indirectly, solicit inquiries
or proposals from, or provide any information to, or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, any Person (other than Purchaser and its
representatives) concerning any merger, sale of assets, acquisition, business
combination, change of control or other similar transaction involving Seller.
Shareholders and Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser after receipt of any
proposal, or any inquiries indicating that any Person is considering making
or wishes to make a proposal, concerning any merger, sale of assets,
acquisition, business combination, change of control or other similar
transaction involving Seller, identifying such Person and the terms thereof.

6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Shareholders and Seller shall give
prompt notice to Purchaser and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Seller
and the Shareholders of any failure of the Shareholders, Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.14_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

6.15 _Professional Liability Insurance_. Prior to the Closing,
Shareholders and Seller shall procure a "tail insurance" professional
liability policy that (a) provides coverage for the 5 year period prior to the
Closing Date, (b) covers Sellers performance under the In-Process
Engagements, Completed Engagements and Support Engagements for periods prior
to the Closing Date, (c) provides coverage in an amount not less than
$100,000,000 (d) names the Purchaser as an additional beneficiary thereof and
(e) contains such other terms and conditions that are reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser. Shareholders and the Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall pay 50% of the cost of the foregoing professional
liability policy. The aggregate premium for such policy shall not exceed $1.1
million. To the extent Purchaser or Seller have a claim under this Agreement
for which coverage may be available under such policy, Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, agree to submit such claim under such policy.

6.16 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
authorize for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to Article II.

6.17 _Investor Qualification_. Seller and each Shareholder, severally and not
jointly, represent, warrant, covenant and agree as follows:

(a) Such Person is an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501
promulgated under the Securities Act). The Parent Common Stock is being
acquired for Sellers own account and not with a view to, or intention of,
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities laws, and such Person will not dispose of the Parent Common
Stock in contravention of the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities laws. Such Person has substantial knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters, has specific experience making investment
decisions of a similar nature and has been furnished with all materials
relating to the business, finances and operations of Parent which have been  



 

54  requested. Such Person has conducted its own investigation of Parent and is
not relying on any representations or warranties relating to Parent, Purchaser
or any other their respective affiliates other than those expressly set forth
in _Article V_ of this Agreement. Such Person understands that investment in
the Parent Common Stock is subject to significant economic risk, including the
illiquidity resulting from the fact that the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to this Agreement will not have been registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws and, therefore, cannot
be sold unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and
any applicable state securities laws or are sold pursuant to an exemption from
such registration. Such Person understands that Parent is under no obligation
to register the Parent Common Stock for Seller or any other Persons behalf.
Accordingly, such Person is able to bear such economic risk of holding the
Parent Common Stock for an indefinite period of time.

(b) Seller shall not distribute any shares of Parent Common Stock to any
former shareholder of Seller in connection with a Former Shareholder Excess
Payment unless and until such former shareholder shall have executed and
delivered to Seller an agreement pursuant to which such former shareholder
makes the same representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
in this _Section 6.17_ as made by each Shareholder.

(c) Such Person further understands that the certificate or certificates (or
book-entry positions) representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
pursuant to this Agreement shall bear a legend (or otherwise contain a
notation) in substantially the following form:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF
THE UNITED STATES. THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, MORTGAGED, PLEDGED,
HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT FOR SUCH SHARES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR AN
OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES."

(d) Such Person shall not, directly or indirectly, during the one (1) year
period following the Closing, (i) establish or increase a put equivalent
position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the
meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to any Parent Common Stock or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Parent Common
Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other similar arrangement that transfers
to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of Parent Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Parent Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Parent Common Stock or such other securities, in cash
or otherwise. Such Person also shall not, directly or indirectly, sell any
Parent Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Parent Common Stock during  



 

55  the period beginning 20 days before the beginning of any period in which the
share price of Parent Common Stock is determined for purposes of
_Sections 2.5(b)_ and _(c)_ and ending on the first trading day after the
end of such period (excluding any such sales made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading
plan approved pursuant to Parents Insider Trading Policy and established more
than 30 days prior to the beginning of such period).

6.18 _Registration Rights_. If at any time during the 6 month period after the
Closing, Parent undertakes an underwritten public primary offering of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act
(other than a registration relating to employee benefit plans, exchange offers
or a merger or acquisition of a business or assets, including a registration
on Form S-4 or Form S-8), Parent shall provide Seller and the Shareholders
with "piggyback" registration rights in connection with such offering with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued as Share Consideration,
subject to a mutually satisfactory registration rights agreement. Among other
things, such registration rights agreement shall contain customary "cut-back,"
withdrawal, indemnification, contribution, "lock-up" and other provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder if the parties do not, for any reason whatsoever, enter into a
mutually satisfactory registration rights agreement within ten (10) days
after notice delivered by Parent to the Seller referencing this section and
including a draft of a registration rights agreement satisfactory to Parent.

10.4 _Indemnification Process_. The party or parties making a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be, for the purposes of this
Agreement, referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and the party or parties
against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article X_ shall be, for the
purposes of this Agreement, referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_." All
claims by any Indemnified Party under this _Article X_ shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) In the event that (i) any claim, demand or Proceeding is asserted or
instituted by any Person other than the parties to this Agreement or their
Affiliates that could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party
could be liable to an Indemnified Party under this Agreement (such claim,
demand or Proceeding, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Indemnified Party
under this Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified by any Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party Claim (such
claim, a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the
nature of such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim and the amount or estimated
amount thereof, if known (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
a delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that (and
only to the extent that) such failure shall have caused the Damages for which
the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be greater than such Damages would have
been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party proper notice.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon
acknowledgment of its obligations under the terms of the indemnity hereunder
in connection with such Third Party Claim, be entitled to appoint counsel of
the Indemnifying Partys choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party to
represent the Indemnified Party and any others the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably designate in connection with such Third Party Claim (in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any separate counsel retained by any Indemnified Party except as
set forth below); _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to
the entry of any Judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of
the Indemnified Party (i) if such Judgment or settlement does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each
Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability in respect to such claim,
(ii) if such Judgment or settlement would result in the finding or admission
of any violation of Law, or (iii) if as a result of such consent or
settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the
Indemnified Party or such Judgment or settlement would interfere with or
adversely affect the  



 

63  business, operations or assets of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
defense against any such asserted liability. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such asserted
liability, but shall not be entitled to settle or compromise such asserted
liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) the claim for indemnification is with
respect to a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation against the Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified Party has
been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (C) the
Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such claim or shall have failed to have engaged counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case, within a reasonable
period of time, or (iv) the claim seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any such claim or action, (B) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control the defense of
such action or claim with counsel of its choosing and the legal and other
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party and (C) the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any defense or
settlement that the Indemnified Party shall make in respect to such action or
claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser
shall have the sole and exclusive right to control the defense and settlement
of any claims for indemnification under _Section 10.3(d)_, and none of the
limitations on the Indemnifying Party contained in this _Section 10.4_ (other
than clauses (ii) and (iii)) shall apply to any such claims.

(c) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice whether or not
the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim. If the Indemnifying Party gives
timely notice disputing any claim (a " _Counter Notice_ "), the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly pay to Indemnified Party all non-disputed amounts and
the parties shall attempt in good faith to agree on resolution of the disputed
amount. If no Counter Notice is received by the Indemnified Party within the
30 days, then the dollar amount of the Claim as set forth in the original
notice shall be deemed established and conclusive for purposes of this
Agreement and, within three Business Days after the end of such 30-day period,
the Indemnifying Party shall make a payment to the Indemnified Party in the
dollar amount claimed in the Indemnified Partys notice.

10.5 _Limitations on Indemnity Payments_. (a) (i) No claim for
indemnification under _Section 10.1(a)_ may be made by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, and no payment in respect of such a claim for
indemnification shall be required from Seller, unless and to the extent the
aggregate amount of Damages which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
incurred exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), after which Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified, subject to _Sections 10.5(b)(i)_ and
_10.5(c)_ , for all Damages in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to, and Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to satisfaction of
the Deductible with respect to (i) claims for fraud or (ii) claims for breach
of the representations or warranties made in the Excepted Sections.



 

64 (ii) No claim for indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ may be made by
the Seller Indemnified Parties, and no payment in respect of such a claim for
indemnification shall be required from Purchaser, unless and to the extent the
aggregate amount of Damages which the Seller Indemnified Parties have incurred
exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Deductible_ "), after which Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified, subject to _Section 10.5(b)(ii)_,
for all Damages in excess of the Purchaser Deductible; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Purchaser Deductible shall not apply to, and the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to
satisfaction of the Purchaser Deductible with respect to (i) claims for fraud
or (ii) claims for breach of the representations or warranties made in
_Sections_ _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.4_ , _5.5_ , _5.6_ and _5.12_.

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified under _Section

_Cap_ "), and Damages with respect to such claims shall be satisfied solely
from (1) first, the amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and (2)
then, by offsetting against the Future Payments as provided in _Section 10.6_
hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to the Cap or any
limitation as to the source of recovery with respect to (i) claims for fraud
or (ii) claims for breach of the representations or warranties made in the
Excepted Sections, but in no event shall Sellers liability for any and all
such claims under this Agreement, except for claims based on fraud, exceed the
Purchase Price.

(ii) The maximum aggregate amount of Damages against which the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified under  _Section
10.3(a)_ with respect to all claims thereunder shall be $20,000,000 (the "
_Purchaser Cap_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to the Purchaser
Cap with respect to (i) claims for fraud or (ii) claims for breach of the
representations or warranties made in _Sections_ _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.4_
, _5.5_ , _5.6_ and _5.12_. 

(c) No claims for indemnification under _Sections 10.2(b)_ or _10.2(d)_ may be
made by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and no payment in respect of any
such claim for indemnification shall be required from any Shareholder, unless
and until, and only to the extent that, recourse to Seller under _Sections
10.1(a)_ and _10.1(c)_ has been exhausted from the amounts held pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement or Future Payments actually then available for offset (as
provided in _Section 10.5(b)(i)_). No Shareholders obligation under _Section
10.2_ shall exceed such Shareholders Pro Rata Share; provided, that as a
condition to any recovery thereof (other than with respect to _Section
10.2(a)_ or _(c)_ ), the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have made such
claim against at least Dale Stockamp, Paul Kohlheim, Norman West Johnson,
Kenneth M. Saitow and Jeff Jones (unless Damages already recovered from any
such Shareholder exceed such Shareholders Pro Rata Share, in which case, no
claim need be made against any such Shareholder).



 

65 10.6 _Offset Rights_. Purchaser shall have the right to withhold or offset
payments under this Agreement (each a " _Future Payment_ "), including (i)
the Earn-Out Payments, (ii) any amounts owed to Seller or Shareholders
pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ or _2.7(e)_ and (iii) the Contingent Payment and
the Contingent Escrow Payment, against any payments that Seller or
Shareholders may owe a Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _Article X_ ,
_Section 6.6_ or otherwise; provided that (i), to the extent practicable, at
least 10 days prior to such withholding or offset, Purchaser has given Seller
written notice of the claim in respect of which such withholding or offset is
made and (ii) Purchaser deposits (by wire transfer in immediately available
funds) the amount withheld or offset with the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
withholding and offset rights set forth in this _Section 10.6_ shall in no
way be deemed to limit or override Purchasers other remedies and rights
under this Agreement or under applicable Law.

10.7 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Seller, the
Shareholders and Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing for the applicable period set forth in this _Section 10.7_. Any and
all claims for indemnification under this _Article X_  arising out of the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Shareholders, Seller
or Purchaser must be made prior to the termination of the applicable survival
period, it being understood that in the event notice of any claim
for indemnification under _Section 10.1(a)_, _10.2(a)_ , _10.2(b)_ or
_10.3(a)_ shall have been given within the applicable survival period, the
representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved. All of
the representations and warranties of Seller, Shareholders and Purchaser
contained in this Agreement and any and all claims and causes of action for
indemnification under this  _Article X_ with respect thereto shall terminate
two years after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties contained in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.6_ ,
_4.1_ ,  _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.22_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , and _5.6_ shall
survive indefinitely after the Closing Date, (ii) the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.15_ shall survive until the date which is
five years after the Closing Date and (iii) the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 4.16_ , _4.18_ and _4.21_ shall survive for the
applicable statute of limitations period plus ninety days. 

10.8 _Treatment and Allocation of Indemnification Payments_. The parties
hereto agree that any indemnification payment pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and shall be allocated
as set forth in _Section 2.6_.

10.9 _Information; Waiver_. The right to indemnification or any other remedy
based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations.



 

66 10.10 _Sole Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the indemnification provisions of this _Article X_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, except for (i) claims
based upon fraud or (ii) claims seeking specific performance; provided,
however, that no Shareholders liability for fraud committed by Seller shall
exceed such Shareholders Pro Rata Share, and no Shareholder shall be liable
for the fraud of another Shareholder. 

ARTICLE XI

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

11.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party to
this Agreement shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
with this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

11.2 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing and without
further consideration, each of the parties, upon the request of the other
party and at such other partys expense, shall execute and deliver such
documents and instruments of conveyance and transfer as such other party may
reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the terms of this
Agreement (including the purchase and sale of the Assets as contemplated by
this Agreement and the vesting in Purchaser of good and marketable title in
the Assets (or in the case of leased property, valid leasehold interests)
transferred under this Agreement).

11.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Purchaser and Seller.

11.4 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; provided that no assignment of any rights or obligations
shall be made by Seller or the Shareholders without the consent of Purchaser
or by Purchaser without the consent of Seller, except that Purchaser may
assign its rights hereunder without such consent to any of its Affiliates,
provided, however, that no such assignment will relieve Purchaser or Parent of
any of its obligations hereunder.

11.5 _Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of
any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees that if any condition to such
partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not satisfied prior to the Closing and such party nonetheless
proceeds with the Closing, such condition shall be deemed to have been waived
by such party.

11.8 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, WITHOUT REGARD TO
THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF THAT COULD MANDATE THE APPLICATION
OF THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH SUCH LAW.

11.9  _Jurisdiction; Arbitration_.

(a) Except as provided in _Section 2.7(c)_, _2.8(b)_ and  _Section
11.9(b)_, each of the Shareholders, Purchaser and Seller hereby expressly and
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court located in Chicago, Illinois and to the jurisdiction of any
other competent court of the State of Illinois located in Chicago, Illinois
(collectively, the " _Illinois Courts_ ") in connection with all disputes
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such Illinois Courts or to assert that any litigation
brought in such courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each such
party hereby waives the right to any other jurisdiction or venue for any
litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to which any of them may be entitled by
reason of its present or future domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
such party agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to bring
any action or proceeding for enforcement of a Judgment entered by an Illinois
Court or an arbitral award rendered in accordance with any provision of this
Agreement in any other court having jurisdiction.

(b) All disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement, of the
breach, termination or validity thereof from and after the Closing Date ("
_Disputes_ "), except for disputes arising exclusively out of violations of
the Non-Competition provisions in _Section 6.8_ hereof, shall be submitted
to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted (i) by a single
arbitrator agreed on by Seller (and/or the Shareholders, as applicable) and
the Purchaser within fifteen days of the receipt by respondent of a copy of
the demand for arbitration, or (ii) in the absence of such timely agreement,
by three arbitrators one appointed by each of Seller (and/or the Shareholders,
as applicable) and the Purchaser within thirty days of the receipt by
respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration and the third appointed by
the two party appointed arbitrators within fifteen days of the appointment of
the second arbitrator, or in default of such timely appointment, by the
American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with the listing,
ranking and striking provisions of the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (the
" _Rules_ "), (the arbitrator agreed on in accordance with clause (i) or the
three arbitrators appointed in accordance with clause (ii) being referred to
herein as the " _Arbitral Tribunal_ "). The arbitration shall be conducted and
administered by the AAA in accordance with the Rules then in effect and
the following provisions:

(i) In the event of any conflict between the Rules and the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

(ii) The arbitration shall be held and the award shall be rendered in
Chicago, Illinois.



 

69 (iii) Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing
(or as soon thereafter as practicable), the Arbitral Tribunal shall prepare
and distribute to the parties a writing setting forth the arbitral award and
the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it is based. Any award
rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the parties, and Judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

(iv) The Arbitral Tribunal shall have no power or authority, under the Rules
or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this Agreement, or
(y) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties.

(v) In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement,
each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, without any right to
indemnification with respect thereto, except that the fees and costs of the
AAA and the Arbitral Tribunal, the costs and expenses of obtaining the
facility where the arbitration hearing is held, and such other costs and
expenses as the Arbitral Tribunal may determine to be directly related to the
conduct of the arbitration and appropriately borne jointly by the parties
(which shall not include any partys attorneys fees or costs, witness
fees (if any), costs of investigation and similar expenses) shall be paid as
follows, without any right to indemnification with respect thereto: 50% of
such fees and expenses shall be paid by the Seller (and/or the Shareholders,
as applicable) and the remaining 50% of such fees and expenses shall be paid
by Purchaser; provided, that the Arbitral Tribunal, in its sole discretion,
shall have the right to assess costs and expenses against either the Seller
(and/or the Shareholders, as applicable) or the Purchaser if it determines
that such party has acted frivolously.

(vi) By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any
Illinois Court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction to
maintain the status quo or prevent irreparable harm, a pre-arbitral attachment
or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of
any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available
under the jurisdiction of a national court, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have
full authority to grant provisional remedies or order the parties to request
that a court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by a
such court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the
Arbitral Tribunals orders to that effect.

(vii) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 6.9_ of this Agreement to the
contrary, all Confidential Information shall be admissible, subject to
available confidentiality protections, in any arbitration conducted pursuant
to this _Section 11.9_ and in any other proceeding brought to enforce this
Agreement or any Related Agreements.



 

70 11.10 _Service of Process_. Each of the Shareholders, the Purchaser and Seller
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 11.9(a)_ in any such
action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified
in or pursuant to _Section 11.6_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the
right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other
legally available method.

11.11 _No Third Party Rights_. Except as specifically provided in _Article X_
, this Agreement is intended to be solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and is not intended to confer any benefits upon, or create any
rights in favor of, any Person other than the parties to this Agreement.

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile
by the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute a single
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties.

11.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision or provisions at issue a valid, legal
and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Preamble, and the Exhibits and
Schedules attached to this Agreement (all of which shall be deemed
incorporated in the Agreement and made a part hereof) set forth the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any prior understanding, agreement
or statement of intent, in each case, written or oral, of any and every nature
with respect to the subject matter hereof. All of the obligations and
representations and warranties of Purchaser under the November 12, 2007
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing.

11.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably waives
(to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) its respective right to a
trial by jury in connection with any matter arising out of this Agreement.

11.16 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.



 

71 11.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Shareholders, Purchaser and Seller
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement,
each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could
not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to
compel specific performance of this Agreement. 

11.18 _Guarantee_. Parent guarantees all payment obligations (including by
means of delivery of Parent Common Stock) of Purchaser under this Agreement,
including any Earn-Out Payments or payment obligations pursuant to _Section
10.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have and may assert against
its obligations hereunder, and Parents obligations hereunder shall be
subject to, any claim, right, deduction or defense of any kind that Purchaser
may have or may assert under this Agreement. No action or omission by
Purchaser shall release Parent from its obligations under this  _Section
11.18_. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, Parent agrees
that its obligations under this _Section 11.18_ shall continue in effect
notwithstanding the insolvency or bankruptcy of Purchaser or the assignment
of this Agreement by Purchaser, and notwithstanding Sellers consent to such
assignment.
