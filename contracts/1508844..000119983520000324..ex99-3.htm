jurisdiction in respect of the Party, in each case in circumstances where
prior consultation with the other Party is not practicable and a copy of such
disclosure is provided to the other Party.

  



   | 4.6| KSM Project Infrastructure on Adjacent Claim  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Purchaser wishes to utilize or construct tunnels under the Adjacent

Project, the Purchaser shall be able to obtain, and Pretium agrees to
provide:

  



   | (a)| Pretiums written consent, addressed to the relevant Crown
regulatory body or bodies, to; and  
---|---|---

to support,  
---|---|---

other authorizations to give effect to the Proposed Access Plans (defined
below) as agreed by the parties, if:

  



   | (c)| The engineers of both parties meet, with the relevant data of
each party provided to the other in advance, and settle conceptual plans as
necessary to plan such Tunnel Infrastructure so as to avoid interference with,
or impacts on, Pretiums ongoing mining and exploration operations and to
minimize the possibility for interference with, or impacts on, potential
future mining and exploration operations by Pretium, including on the
Adjacent Claim;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Pretium receives, not less than 18 months before the proposed
commencement of any use of, or construction of, Tunnel Infrastructure,
detailed written plans developed by the Parties engineers for the use and
construction of the proposed Tunnel Infrastructure, including (without
limitation) the location and storage of any rock or soil materials removed by
the Purchaser in connection with the construction of the Tunnel
Infrastructure (collectively, the "Proposed Access Plans"); and

     | (e)| Pretium determines that such Proposed Access Plans (i) will
not interfere with, or impact, Pretiums ongoing mining and
exploration operations, (ii) are not expected to interfere with, or impact,
Pretiums potential future mining and exploration operations on the Adjacent
Claim, and (ii) include reasonably satisfactory legal and contractual
protections for Pretium and its associates and affiliates in respect of any
liabilities arising from the construction and use of the Tunnel Infrastructure
by the Purchaser or its affiliates or representatives.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If Pretium provides such consent and efforts in support, the Purchaser agrees
that no construction or use of the Tunnel Infrastructure by the Purchaser or
its associates, affiliates, agents or representatives shall commence unless
and until the Purchaser has, to Pretiums reasonable satisfaction, obtained
all legal and regulatory consents, permits or authorizations in order to
permit such construction or use.

  



  

While the parties are following the foregoing process for settling Proposed
Access Plans, the Purchaser shall pay all costs associated with all the
preparation and review of the Proposed Access Plans (including the costs of
any external advisors engaged by Pretium or the Purchaser in connection with
the review and assessment of such Proposed Access Plans, whether or not the
Tunnel Infrastructure is ultimately developed or used) and all costs
associated with the implementation of the Proposed Access Plans, including
(if applicable) the construction and maintenance of tunnels constructed and
operated by the Purchaser, including all reclamation and compliance costs. If
Pretium provides such consent and efforts in support, the Purchaser hereby
indemnifies and saves harmless Pretium and its associates and affiliates from
any and all claims, actions, causes of action, proceedings, losses (including
loss of profit), damages, costs, liabilities and expenses incurred, suffered
or sustained as a result of or in relation to the construction, maintenance
or use of the Tunnel Infrastructure.

  



  

For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
granting to the Purchaser any interest in the property, assets and rights of
every description whether real, personal or mixed, relating to the Mineral
Rights in respect of the Adjacent Claim.

  



   | 4.7| Condition on Transfer of Adjacent Claim  
---|---|---

Claim to a third party acquiror unless Pretium delivers to the Purchaser a
deed under which the assignee covenants to assume and be bound by the terms of
Section 4.6 (to the extent of the interest assigned). After Pretium has
delivered such a deed to the Purchaser, Pretium shall be released and
discharged from the observance and performance thereafter of its covenants,
obligations and liabilities under Section 4.6 but only to the extent of the
assumption thereof by the assignee.

  



   | 4.8| Tax Matters  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Purchaser shall be solely liable for any and all transfer, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes (including penalties
and interest in respect thereof but excluding any income or capital taxes
payable or collectible by Pretium as a result of the Transaction) ("Transfer
Taxes") incurred in respect of the Transaction, including liabilities
arising from the reassessment or nonpayment of any such Transfer Taxes, but
in each case only to the extent such Transfer Taxes or liabilities arise from
the conveyance or a transfer of the Purchased Assets by Pretium to the
Purchaser. Each party shall, at its own expense, timely file any tax return
or other document with respect to such Transfer Taxes (and each party shall
cooperate with each other party with respect thereto as reasonably
necessary).

    

14

 



    

The Purchaser shall indemnify and save harmless Pretium and its shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, advisors and agents from all claims, actions,
causes of action, proceedings, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and
expenses incurred, suffered or sustained as a result of a failure by the
Purchaser:

  



   | (a)| to pay any Transfer Taxes payable or collectible by Pretium in
connection with the conveyance or transfer of the Purchased Assets whether
arising from a reassessment or otherwise, including provincial retail sales
tax, if applicable; and/or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| to file any returns, certificates, filings, elections, notices
or other documents required to be filed by the Purchaser with any federal,
provincial or other taxing authorities in connection with the conveyance or
transfer of the Purchased Assets.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges
that in the event any Transfer Taxes are exigible in connection with the
Transaction, such Transfer Taxes shall be in addition to the amounts payable
under Section 2.2. For greater certainty, if Pretium is required by Law to
collect any applicable Transfer Taxes from the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
pay such Transfer Taxes to Pretium on the Closing Date and Pretium will remit
such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority and provide the
Purchaser with evidence of such payment within seven (7) Business Days. Where
Pretium is not required by Law to collect applicable Transfer Taxes, the
Purchaser shall pay such Transfer Taxes directly to the appropriate
Governmental Authority and shall provide evidence of such payment to Pretium
within seven (7) Business Days.

  



   | 4.9| Reclamation  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Pretium agrees that, after the Closing Date, Pretium shall continue to be
responsible for completing the reclamation of the Property that may be
required under Mines Act Permit MX-1-842 as of the date of this Agreement as
described in the Disclosure Letter. If, before Pretium completes such
reclamation, the Purchaser is required to perform such reclamation by any
order or direction under the Mines Act or as a condition to the Purchaser
obtaining a permit or permits for its activities on the Property, Pretium
covenants and agrees that:

  



   | (a)| Pretium will, to the extent it is reasonably practicable to do
so, promptly perform the reclamation work within the required timeframes of
the order or direction or the timeframe specified by the Purchaser, acting
reasonably, for obtaining its permit(s); or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| if Pretium is not willing or able to perform such work within
the required timeframes, the Purchaser may complete such reclamation work and
Pretium will reimburse the Purchaser for its reasonable direct costs of
performing such work.

SCHEDULE "B"

  



  

SNOWFIELD NET SMELTER RETURNS ROYALTY AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS ROYALTY AGREEMENT dated as of the ____ day of December, 2020.

  



  

BETWEEN:

  



  

KSM MINING ULC, a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia

  



  

("Payor")

  



  

AND:

  



  

PRETIUM EXPLORATION INC., a corporation incorporated under the laws of
British Columbia

  



  

(the "Recipient")

  



  

WHEREAS the Payor has this day acquired from the Recipient, and is the
registered and beneficial owner of, the mineral claim (the "Claim") set out
in Schedule "C" of a Property Purchase Agreement between Payor and the
Recipient dated December 4, 2020, (the "Purchase Agreement"); and

  



  

AND WHEREAS the Purchase Agreement provides that the Payor shall enter into
this agreement to grant the Royalty (as defined below) to the Recipient on
and subject to the terms set out herein.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration (the receipt and
sufficiency of which is acknowledged by each of the parties), the parties
agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| _Net Smelter Returns_ - For the purpose hereof, the term "Net
Smelter Returns" shall, subject to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 below, mean
gross revenues received from the sale by the Payor of all ore mined from the
Claim and from the sale by the Payor of concentrate, dore, metal and products
derived from ore mined from the Claim (the "Products"), after deduction of
the following:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| all smelting and refining costs, sampling, assaying and
treatment charges and penalties including but not limited to metal
losses, penalties for impurities and charges for refining, selling and
handling by the smelter, refinery or other purchaser (including price
participation charges by smelters and/or refiners); and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| costs of handling, transporting, securing and insuring such
material from the Claim or from a concentrator, whether situated on or
off the Claim, to a smelter, refinery or other place of treatment and then on
to the place of sale, and in the case of gold or silver concentrates,
security costs; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| ad valorem taxes and taxes based upon sales or production, but
not income taxes.  
---|---|--- 
   

B-1

 



     | 2.| _Non-Arm s Length Revenue_ - Where revenue otherwise to be
included under this Royalty Agreement is received by the Payor in a
transaction with a party with whom it is not dealing at arms length, the
revenue to be included shall be based on the market price under the
circumstances and at the time of the transaction. For this purpose, the market
price is:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| in relation to Products that are gold or silver, the daily
arithmetic average price for the applicable metal, quoted as the London PM
fix price for gold (expressed in US$ per troy ounce) and the London fix price
for silver (expressed in US$ per troy ounce) by the London Bullion Market
Association for the relevant quarter in which the Products are sold; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| in relation to Products that are not gold or silver, the daily
arithmetic average price for the applicable Product, calculated by the London
Metal Exchange in respect of the contract reported most commonly in the
financial media as the spot price for the relevant quarter in which the
Product is sold.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| _Non-Arm s Length Costs_ - Where a cost otherwise deductible
under this Royalty Agreement is incurred by the Payor in a transaction with a
party with whom it is not dealing at arms length, the cost to be deducted
shall be the fair market cost under the circumstances and at the time of the
transaction.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| _Currency _ - For the purpose of determining Net Smelter
Returns, all receipts and major disbursements will be calculated in
U.S. dollars. Revenues received or costs incurred in Canadian Dollars will be
converted into U.S. Dollars for the purposes of calculating net smelter
returns for a quarter using the arithmetic average of the monthly average
CAD$:US$ exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada for each month in the
quarter.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| _Hedging _ - The Payor may, but shall not be under any duty to,
engage in price protection (hedging) or speculative transactions such as
futures contracts and commodity options in its sole discretion covering all or
part of production from the Claim and, except in the case where Products are
actually delivered and a sale is actually consummated under such price
protection or speculative transactions, none of the revenues, costs, profits
or losses from such transactions shall be taken into account in
calculating Net Smelter Returns or any interest therein.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| _Commingling _ - The Payor shall have the right to commingle ore
from the Claim with ore from other mineral tenures and waste rock from the
Claim with waste rock from other mineral tenures. Before any ore from the
Claim is commingled with ore from other properties, the ore produced from the
Claim shall be measured and sampled in accordance with sound mining and
metallurgical practices for the tonnages and location of ore and the
characteristics of such material including the metal content of ore removed
from, the estimated recovery of metals from ore from, and to any special
charges relating particularly to ore, concentrates or other products or the
treatment thereof derived from, the Claim and such mining tenures.
Representative samples of the ores shall be retained by the Payor and Payor
shall retain such analyses for a reasonable amount of time, but not less than
twenty four (24) months, after Payor makes payment of the Royalty in relation
to the ore so processed from the Claim, and shall retain such samples
taken from the Claim for not less than thirty (30) days after collection. The
determination of whether material mined from the Claim is ore and sent to the
mill or waste rock will be made by the Payor in its sole discretion.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| _NSR Interest_ - The Payor hereby grants to the Recipient a
royalty (the "Royalty") in respect of the Claim entitling the Receipt to
payment equal to 1.5% of Net Smelter Returns. The Payor shall be entitled to
deduct from any amounts payable under this Agreement the amount of the
Advance Royalty Payment paid by the Payor to the Recipient as required by the
Purchase Agreement and this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
   

B-2

 



      | 8.| _Advance Royalty Payment_ - As a repetition of part of its
obligations set out in Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement, not as the
creation of a new, independent obligation, the Payor shall pay to the
Recipient the Advance Royalty Payment (being $15 million) within six (6)
months following the earlier of: (i) commencement of commercial production
from the Property (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or any part thereof;
and (ii) announcement by the Payor (or one of the companies which owns,
directly or indirectly, shares of the Payor) of a Bankable Feasibility Study
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) which includes production of
reserves from the Property.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| _Payments _ - Except as required in Section 8 of this Agreement
in respect of the Advance Royalty Payment, payments of the Royalty shall be
made to the Recipient within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in
which Net Smelter Returns, as determined on the basis of final adjusted
invoices, are received by the Payor. All such payments shall be made in U.S.
dollars.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| _Calculations _ - After the year in which commercial production
is commenced on the Claim, the Recipient receiving a percentage of
Net Smelter Returns from the Payor (whether directly or by way of set-off
against the Advance Royalty Payment) shall be provided annually on or before
April 1 with a copy of the calculation of Net Smelter Returns, determined in
accordance with this Royalty Agreement, for the preceding calendar year,
certified correct by the Payor.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 11.| _Audits _ - The Recipient will have the right to engage, at its
cost, independent auditors to audit any annual calculation of Net Smelter
Returns provided by the Payor documenting the calculation of the Royalty
payments made during the preceding year provided such audit is completed
within one hundred and eighty (180) days of receipt by the Recipient of the
documentation of the calculation of the Royalty payments for that year. The
independent auditors engaged by the Recipient must be a firm of nationally
recognized professional accountants with experience auditing large scale
precious or base metals mining operations. Any such audit shall be for a
reasonable length of time during regular business hours, at a mutually
convenient time, upon at least ten (10) Business Days prior written notice
by the Recipient, and the Payor will grant all such rights of access to the
independent auditors as may reasonably be required to conduct the audit,
subject at all times to the reasonable workplace rules and supervision of the
Payor, and provided that any rights of access do not unreasonably interfere
with any exploration, development, mining or milling activities conducted on
the Claim. If the audit conducted by the Recipient concludes that the Payor
has underpaid any Royalty payments in the preceding year, then the Payor and
the Recipient and their respective auditors will meet within fifteen (15)
days of the Recipient advising the Payor of such a conclusion to discuss the
details of the audit and the determination of an underpayment as well as the
related accounting policies and attempt to reach agreement on the amount of
the underpayment, if any. If there is no agreement reached and the Recipient
decides to pursue a claim against the Payor for underpayment, the Payors
liability in such proceedings for an underpayment shall be:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the amount of the underpayment, if any, finally determined in
any proceedings brought by the Recipient; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| if the size of the underpayment is greater than 5% of the
Royalty payments made to the Recipient in the previous year, the
Recipients costs of the audit of such Royalty payments.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| _Rights of Parties_ -  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Payor and the Recipient expressly acknowledge and agree that
the grant of Royalty hereunder is intended to be binding upon the successors
and assigns of Payor and all successors of the Payor in title to the Claim,
that the Royalty constitutes an interest in the Claim and will run with the
title to the Claim so that any disposition or transfer of the Claim, or any
interest therein, shall be subject to the Royalty. For greater certainty, it
is the intent of the Payor and Recipient hereto that, to the extent allowed by
law, the Royalty shall constitute a vested interest in and a covenant running
with the Claim and all successions thereof whether created privately or
through governmental action;  
---|---|--- 
      

B-3

 



           | (b)| Other than the Advance Royalty Payment, the
payment of which shall be governed by Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement
(and as repetition, Section 8 of this Agreement), all payments due to the
Recipient on account of the Royalty shall become the property of the
Recipient at the time of receipt by the Payor of the Net Smelter Returns and
shall be held by the Payor in trust for the Recipient until paid to the
Recipient.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Payor shall, upon request of the Recipient, sign and deliver
to the Recipient, and the Recipient may register or otherwise record against
the Claim, such form of notice or other document as the Recipient may
reasonably request to give notice of the existence of the Royalty to third
parties. The Payor shall be responsible (at its sole cost) for obtaining any
and all authorizations and other rights (including third party notices and
consents) necessary in connection with creation of the Royalty and its
registration against the Claim.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| The Payor will also take all commercially reasonable steps and
perform all commercially reasonable acts, and execute and deliver
such agreements and other documents as the Recipient may reasonably request
to secure payment of the Royalty and protect the Recipients right to receive
the Net Smelter Returns as contemplated herein provided that the Payor shall
not be required to grant any rights (including security interests) in excess
of the rights granted by the Payor pursuant to the Security Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| The Payor shall provide its written consent or signature to any
documents or things reasonably necessary to accomplish the registration of
this Agreement, any related security document (including the Security
Agreement) and any related notice, financing statement, instrument, document
or other agreement, as applicable, in (i) British Columbias Personal Property
Registry; and (ii) British Columbias Mineral Titles Online Registry, or any
other registry or office in accordance with applicable law, with respect
to any surface rights comprising the Property.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Subject to the proviso in the last sentence of this Section
12(f), the Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any security granted

---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Make all operational decisions with respect to the methods and

the form of a definitive transaction agreement) upon which the Recipient is
prepared to complete the Disposition of the Offered Interest and comply with
the remaining provisions of this Section 16.  
---|---|--- 
      

B-5

 



       | (b)| A Notice shall be deemed to constitute an offer ("1st

Disposition shall be consummated within twenty (20) calendar days of such
acceptance; provided that, if any governmental approvals are required in
connection with such transaction, such twenty (20) calendar day period shall
be extended until the expiration of five days following the date on which all
governmental approvals required with respect to such proposed transaction are
obtained (including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under applicable law).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| If the Payor does not accept the 1st Offer as to all (but not
less than all) of the Offered Interest within the forty-five (45)
calendar day period, the Recipient may complete a Disposition of all (but not
less than all) of the Offered Interest to the proposed third party acquiror
as set out in the Notice on (i) the terms and conditions set out in the
Notice, and (ii) the terms and conditions of this Agreement, provided that,
within forty-five (45) calendar days of the expiration of the right of the
Payor to accept the 1st Offer provided for in this Section 16:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| such Disposition shall be completed; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the Recipient has delivered notice of such Disposition to the
Payor,  
---|---|--- 
  



  

failing which the Recipient must again comply with the provisions of this
Section 16 in respect of a Disposition of the Offered Interest.

  



   | (d)| The Payor must not transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose
of all or any interest in the Claim or this Royalty Agreement unless the
Payor delivers to the Recipient a deed under which (i) the assignee covenants
to assume and be bound by the terms of this Royalty Agreement (to the extent
of the interest assigned) and (ii) the assignee agrees to enter into a
security agreement with the Recipient on substantially the same terms as the

this Royalty Agreement but only to the extent of the assumption thereof by the
assignee. The Payor may not Transfer any interest in this Royalty Agreement

\- 11 -

     | 4.3| Further Documentation  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Chargor will from time to time promptly and duly authorize, execute and
deliver such further instruments and documents, and take such further action,
as Pretium may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of, and the rights and powers granted by, this Agreement (including
the filing of any financing statements or financing change statements under
any applicable legislation with respect to the Security Interests created by
this Agreement). The Chargor acknowledges that this Agreement has been
prepared based on the existing laws in the province referred to in the
"Governing Law" section of this Agreement and that a change in such laws, or
the laws of other jurisdictions, may require the execution and delivery of
different forms of security documentation. Accordingly, the Chargor agrees
that Pretium will have the right to require that this Agreement be amended,
supplemented or replaced, and that the Chargor will promptly on request by
Pretium authorize, execute and deliver any such amendment, supplement or
replacement (i) to reflect any changes in such laws, whether arising as a
result of statutory amendments, court decisions or otherwise, (ii) to
facilitate the creation and registration of appropriate security in all
appropriate jurisdictions, or (iii) if the Chargor merges or amalgamates with
any other Person or enters into any corporate reorganization, in each case in
order to confer on the Pretium Security Interests similar to, and having the
same effect as, the Security Interests created by this Agreement.

  



   | 4.4| Maintenance of Collateral  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Chargor will maintain the Secured Assets by taking all steps necessary to
maintain their existence, pay fees, taxes or other amounts and make all

   | 4.5| Verification of Secured Assets  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Pretium shall have the right to verify the existence and state of the Secured
Assets in any reasonable manner Pretium may consider appropriate, and the
Chargor agrees to furnish all assistance and information and to perform all
such acts as Pretium may reasonably request in connection therewith and for
such purpose to grant to Pretium or their agents access to all places where
the Secured Assets may be located and to all premises occupied by the Chargor
subject only to the following:

  



   | (a)| if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Pretium
shall have delivered to the Chargor reasonable prior written notice with
respect to its intention to verify the Secured Assets at reasonable times
during normal business hours, but not more than two times per year; or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Pretium
shall be entitled to verify the existence and state of the Secured Assets at
any time and from time to time.  
---|---|---

any adverse claim.

  



  

ARTICLE 5 
 DEFAULT

  



   | 5.1| Acceleration  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the
option of Pretium, the Secured Obligations may be accelerated and become
immediately due and payable in full (to the extent contemplated by the
Property Purchase Agreement or the Snowfield Royalty Agreement, as
applicable) and the Charges shall thereupon immediately become enforceable
without the necessity for any further action or notice by Pretium.

  



   | 5.2| Security Enforceable  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The fact that this Agreement contemplates events of default and rights of
acceleration shall not derogate from the demand nature of any Secured
Obligation which is payable on demand.

  



   | 5.3| Waiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Pretium may waive any Event of Default or any breach by the Chargor of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. No waiver, however, shall be deemed to
extend to a subsequent breach or Event of Default, whether or not the same as
or similar to the breach or Event of Default waived, and no act or omission
by Pretium shall extend to, or be taken in any manner whatsoever to affect,
any subsequent breach or Event of Default or the Rights of Pretium arising
therefrom. Any such waiver must be in writing and signed by Pretium to be
effective. No failure on the part of Pretium to exercise, and no delay by
Pretium in exercising, any Right under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such Right. No single or partial exercise of any such Right shall
preclude any other or further exercise of such Right or the exercise of any
other Right.

  



  

ARTICLE 6 
 REMEDIES ON DEFAULT

  



   | 6.1| Remedies of Pretium  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Charges become enforceable in accordance with Article 5, Pretium shall
have the Rights set out in this Article 6.

     



 

\- 13 -

     | 6.2| Right to Appoint a Receiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Pretium may appoint by instrument in writing one or more Receivers of any
Secured Assets. Any such Receiver shall have the Rights set out in this
Article 6. In exercising such Rights, any Receiver shall act as and for all
purposes shall be deemed to be the agent of the Chargor and Pretium shall not
be responsible for any act or default of any Receiver. Pretium may remove any
Receiver and appoint another from time to time. An officer or employee of
Pretium may be appointed as a Receiver. To the extent permitted under
applicable Law, no Receiver appointed by Pretium need be appointed by, nor
need its appointment be ratified by, or its actions in any way supervised by,
a court. If two or more Receivers are appointed to act concurrently, they
shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in the instrument appointing them,
so act severally and not jointly and severally. The appointment of any
Receiver or anything done by a Receiver or the removal or termination of any
Receiver shall not have the effect of constituting Pretium a mortgagee in
possession in respect of the Secured Assets.

  



   | 6.3| Rights of a Receiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any Receiver appointed by Pretium shall have the following Rights:

  



   | (a)| _Right of Possession and Power of Entry_. The Chargor shall
forthwith upon demand deliver to a Receiver possession of any Secured Assets
at the place specified by the Receiver. Any Receiver may at any time enter
upon any premises owned, leased or otherwise occupied by the Chargor or where
any Secured Assets is located to take possession of, disable or remove any
Secured Assets, and may use whatever lawful means the Receiver considers
advisable to do so.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| _Power of Sale._   
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| Any Receiver may sell, lease, consign, license, assign or
otherwise dispose of any Secured Assets by public auction, private tender or
private contract with or without notice, advertising or any other formality,
all of which are hereby waived by the Chargor to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Any Receiver may, at its discretion, establish the terms of
such disposition, including terms and conditions as to credit, upset, reserve
bid or price. All payments made pursuant to such dispositions shall be
credited against the Secured Obligations only as they are actually received.
Any Receiver may buy in, rescind or vary any contract for the disposition of
any Secured Assets and may dispose of any Secured Assets again without being
answerable for any loss occasioned thereby. Any such disposition may take
place whether or not the Receiver has taken possession of the Secured Assets.
The exercise by the Receiver of any power of sale does not preclude the
Receiver from further exercise of its power of sale in accordance with this
clause.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| _Discharge of Lien_. Any Receiver may pay any liability secured
by any actual or threatened Lien against any Secured Assets. A Receiver may
borrow money for the maintenance, preservation or protection of any Secured
Assets or for carrying on any of the business or undertaking of the Chargor
and may grant any Lien in any Secured Assets in priority to the Charges as
security for the money so borrowed. The Chargor will forthwith on demand
reimburse the Receiver for all such payments and borrowings, together with
interest thereon at the prime rate of interest charged by the Royal Bank of
Canada to its commercial customers plus 5% per annum.  
---|---|--- 
     



 

\- 14 -

     | (d)| _Dealing with Secured Assets_. Any Receiver may seize,
collect, realize, dispose of, enforce, release to third parties or
otherwise deal with any Secured Assets in such manner, upon such terms and
conditions and at such time as it deems advisable without notice to the
Chargor (except as otherwise required by applicable Law), and may charge on
its own behalf and pay to others its costs and expenses (including legal,
Receivers and accounting fees and expenses on a full indemnity basis)
incurred in connection with such actions. The Chargor will forthwith upon
demand reimburse the Receiver for all such costs or expenses.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| _Powers with respect to Secured Assets_. Any Receiver may have,
enjoy and exercise all of the Rights of and enjoyed by the Chargor with
respect to the Secured Assets or incidental, ancillary, attaching or deriving
from the ownership by the Chargor of the Secured Assets, including the Right
to enter into agreements over or pertaining to Secured Assets, the Right to
commence or continue Litigation to preserve or protect Secured Assets and the
Right to grant or agree to Liens and grant or reserve _profits a
prendr_e, easements, rights-of-ways, rights in the nature of easements and
licenses over or pertaining to the whole or any part of the Secured Assets.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| _Retain Services_. Any Receiver may retain the services of such
real estate brokers and agents, lawyers, accountants, appraisers and other
consultants as the Receiver may deem necessary or desirable in connection with
anything done or to be done by the Receiver or with any of the Rights of the
Receiver set out herein and pay their commissions, fees and disbursements
(which payment shall constitute part of the Receivers disbursements
reimbursable by the Chargor hereunder). The Chargor shall forthwith on
demand reimburse the Receiver for all such payments.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.4| Right to have Court Appoint a Receiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Pretium may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a Receiver, or other official, who may have powers the same as, greater or
lesser than, or otherwise different from, those capable of being granted to a
Receiver appointed by Pretium pursuant to this Agreement.

  



   | 6.5| Pretium may exercise Rights of a Receiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

In lieu of, or in addition to, exercising its Rights under Sections 6.3 and
6.4, Pretium has, and may exercise, any of the Rights which are capable of
being granted to a Receiver appointed by Pretium pursuant to this Agreement.

     



 

\- 15 -

     | 6.6| Limitation of Liability  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Neither Pretium nor any Receiver shall be liable or accountable for any
failure of Pretium or any Receiver to seize, collect, realize, dispose of,
enforce or otherwise deal with any Secured Assets nor shall any of them be
bound to institute Litigation for any such purposes or for the purpose of
preserving any Rights of Pretium, the Chargor or any other Person in respect
of any Secured Assets. Neither Pretium nor any Receiver shall be liable or
responsible for any loss and expense whatever which may accrue in
consequence of any such failure resulting from any negligence of Pretium, any
Receiver or any of their respective Representatives or otherwise, except to
the extent determined by a final judgment to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of any Receiver, Pretium or their
respective Representatives. If any Receiver or Pretium takes possession of any
Secured Assets, neither Pretium nor any Receiver shall have any liability as
a mortgagee in possession or be accountable for anything except
actual receipts.

  



   | 6.7| Extensions of Time  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Pretium or any Receiver appointed by Pretium may grant renewals, extensions
of time and other indulgences, take and give up Liens, accept compositions,
grant releases and discharges, perfect or fail to perfect any Liens, release
any Secured Assets to third parties and otherwise deal or fail to deal with
the Chargor, debtors of the Chargor, guarantors, sureties and others and with
any Secured Assets and other Liens as Pretium may see fit, all without
prejudice to the liability of the Chargor to Pretium or the Rights of Pretium
and any Receiver under this Agreement.

  



   | 6.8| Set-off, Combination of Accounts and Crossclaims  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Secured Obligations will be paid by the Chargor without regard to any
equities between the Chargor and Pretium or any Right of Set-off or cross-
claim (except as may be contemplated pursuant to the Property Purchase
Agreement or the Snowfield Royalty Agreement, as applicable). Any
indebtedness owing by Pretium to the Chargor, direct or indirect, extended or
renewed, actual or contingent, mutual or not, may be set off or applied
against, or combined with, the Secured Obligations by Pretium at any time
either before or after maturity, without demand upon or notice to anyone.

  



   | 6.9| Deficiency  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the proceeds of the realization of any Secured Assets are insufficient to
repay all liquidated Secured Obligations, the Chargor shall forthwith pay or
cause to be paid to Pretium such deficiency.

  



   | 6.10| Validity of Sale  
---|---|--- 
  



  

No Person dealing with Pretium or any Receiver or with any Representative of
Pretium or any Receiver shall be concerned to inquire whether the Charges
have become enforceable, whether any Right of Pretium or any Receiver has
become exercisable, whether any Secured Obligations remain outstanding or
otherwise as to the propriety or regularity of any dealing by Pretium or any
Receiver with any Secured Assets or to see to the application of any money
paid to Pretium or any Receiver, and in the absence of fraud on the part of
such Person such dealings shall be deemed, as regards such Person, to be
within the Rights hereby conferred and to be valid and effective accordingly.

     



 

\- 16 -

     | 6.11| Pretium or Receiver may Perform  
---|---|--- 
  



  

From and after an Event of Default which is continuing, if the Chargor fails
to perform any Secured Obligation, without limiting any other provision
hereof, Pretium or any Receiver may perform that Secured Obligation as
attorney for the Chargor in accordance with Section 7.16. The Chargor shall
remain liable under each agreement, Right and License to which it is party or
by which it or any of its assets is bound and shall perform all of its
obligations thereunder, and shall not be released from any of its
obligations under any such agreement, Right or License by the exercise of any
Rights by Pretium or any Receiver. Neither Pretium nor any Receiver shall
have any obligation under any such agreement, Right or License, by reason of
this Agreement, nor shall Pretium or any Receiver be obliged to perform any
of the obligations of the Chargor thereunder or to take any action to collect
or enforce any claim made subject to the security of this Agreement. The
Rights conferred on Pretium and any Receiver under this Agreement are for the
purpose of protecting the Charge in the Secured Assets and shall not impose
any obligation upon Pretium or any Receiver to exercise any such Rights.

  



   | 6.12| Effect of Appointment of Receiver  
---|---|--- 
  



  

As soon as Pretium takes possession of any Secured Assets or appoints a
Receiver over any Secured Assets, all Rights of each of the Representatives
of the Chargor with respect to that Secured Assets shall cease, unless
specifically continued by the written consent of Pretium or the Receiver.

  



   | 6.13| Time for Payment  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If Pretium demands payment of any Secured Obligations in accordance with the
terms thereof, or if any Secured Obligations are otherwise due by maturity or
acceleration, it shall be deemed reasonable for Pretium to exercise its Rights
under this Agreement immediately if such payment is not made within a
reasonable time of demand, in the case of Secured Obligations payable on
demand, or when due in all other cases, and any days of grace or any time for
payment which might otherwise be required to be afforded to the Chargor by
any agreement or applicable Law is hereby irrevocably waived to the extent
permitted by law.

  



   | 6.14| Rights in Addition  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Rights conferred by this Article 6 are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other Rights Pretium may have under this Agreement, at
law, in equity or by or under applicable Law or other agreement. Pretium may
proceed by way of any action, suit or other proceeding at law or in equity
including (i) the Right to take proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the sale or foreclosure of the Secured Assets and (ii)
filing proofs of claim and other documentation to establish the claims of
Pretium in any Litigation relating to the Chargor. No Right of Pretium or any
Receiver shall be exclusive of or dependent on any other. Any such Right may
be exercised separately or in combination, and at any time. The exercise by
Pretium or any Receiver of any Right hereunder does not preclude Pretium or
any Receiver from further exercise of such Right in accordance with this
Agreement.

---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not relieve the Chargor or any other party to any of the Secured Assets
from the observance or performance of any term, covenant, condition or

liability to any other party or parties thereto or impose any obligation on
Pretium to observe or perform any such term, covenant, condition or agreement
to be so observed or performed, and the Chargor hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Pretium from and against any and all losses, liabilities
(including liabilities for penalties) Expenses and any other costs and

perform any term, covenant, condition or agreement on the part of the
Chargor to be performed under or in respect of the Secured Assets (and/or
enforce any of the rights of the Chargor thereunder) without thereby waiving
any rights to enforce this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 or

possession of the Secured Assets or the lessee under any lease or agreement to
lease unless Pretium has agreed to become such mortgagee in possession or to
be a lessee.

written cancellation and discharge of the mortgage and charge of this
Agreement executed and delivered to the Chargor, its Successors or assigns

DISCLOSURE LETTER

  



  

December 4, 2020

  



  

To: KSM Mining ULC (the "Purchaser")

  



  

From: Pretium Exploration Inc. (the "Vendor")

  



  

Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

  



  

Re: Property Purchase Agreement

  



  

This letter (the "Disclosure Letter"), together with the attached schedules
and exhibits, constitutes the "Pretium Disclosure Letter" referred to and
defined in the property purchase agreement (the "Property Purchase
Agreement") among Pretium Resources Inc. ("Pretium"), the Purchaser and the
Vendor, whereby, among other things, the Vendor will sell and the Purchaser
will purchase the Purchased Assets subject to the terms and conditions as set
out in the Property Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in
the Property Purchase Agreement.

  



  

The purpose of this Disclosure Letter is to set forth in the attached
schedules and exhibits the disclosure of qualifications, modifications or
exceptions to certain representations and warranties of the Vendor and Pretium
contained in the Property Purchase Agreement, and this Disclosure Letter is
deemed to constitute an integral part of such Property Purchase Agreement. The
information contained in any part of this Disclosure Letter is disclosed
solely for the purposes of the Property Purchase Agreement, and
descriptions or terms of agreements and documents herein are summaries only
and are qualified in their entirety by the specific terms of such agreements
and documents.

  



  

The numbering of the attached schedules corresponds to the same section or
subsection in the Property Purchase Agreement. For greater clarity, any
introductory language and headings in this Disclosure Letter are inserted for
convenience of reference only and will not create or be deemed to create a
different standard of disclosure than the language set forth in the Property
Purchase Agreement. In this Disclosure Letter, the words "hereof", "herein"
and similar expressions refer to this Disclosure Letter, and the words
"including", "includes" and similar expressions shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". Information disclosed in any schedule of
this Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to such
other sections or subsections of the Property Purchase Agreement or this
Disclosure Letter to which such written information, on its face, would
pertain to in light of the form and substance of the disclosure made.

  



  

No item in this Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, law or regulation shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred, and nothing in this Disclosure Letter constitutes an
admission of any liability or obligation of Pretium or the Vendor to any third
party or shall confer or give to any third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right. For greater
certainty, no reference herein to any agreement or document shall be
construed as an admission or indication by Pretium or the Vendor to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including, without limitation, that such
agreement or document is enforceable or currently in effect, or that there
are any obligations remaining to be performed or any rights that may be
exercised under such agreement or document, except as otherwise explicitly
set forth herein or in the Property Purchase Agreement. Items disclosed herein
in response to provisions in the Property Purchase Agreement, whether or not
such provisions are qualified by "materiality" or similar qualifications, are
not necessarily considered by Pretium or the Vendor to be material. The mere
inclusion of disclosure regarding an item in this Disclosure Letter will not
be deemed to be an admission by Pretium or the Vendor that such item (or any
non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
material or is required to be disclosed in connection with the
representations, warranties or covenants made by Pretium and the Vendor in the
Property Purchase Agreement.

     



 



    

This Disclosure Letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
provisions of the Property Purchase Agreement, and is not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, any representation,
warranty, undertaking, assurance, covenant, indemnity, guarantee or other
commitment of any nature whatsoever not expressly given in the Property
Purchase Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references
to dollars are to U.S. Dollars.

  



  

The Purchaser acknowledges that the information in the Schedules to this
Disclosure Letter is confidential and proprietary information of Pretium and
the Vendor which, if disclosed, would be seriously prejudicial to the
interests of Pretium or the Vendor and which does not affect the rights and
interests being transferred to the Purchaser. The Purchaser will not, without
the prior written consent of Pretium and the Vendor, disclose all or any
portion of this Disclosure Letter or the information set out herein.
This Disclosure Letter shall be governed by and construed in all respects in
accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal
laws of Canada applicable therein. Except as the context otherwise requires,
the information set out in this Disclosure Letter is presented as of the date
hereof.
