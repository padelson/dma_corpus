directors of the Company (the  "Company  Designees").  Subject to the  fiduciary
duties of the board of directors of Acquiror,  Acquiror  shall take such actions
as shall be  necessary  to cause  the  Company  Designees  to be  nominated  for
election at Acquiror's  annual meeting to be held in 2002 and shall support such

                                   ARTICLE II

    CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES and other INSTRUMENTS


         SECTION 2.01.  Conversion of Securities.

     At the Effective Time, as provided in this Merger  Agreement,  by virtue of
the  Merger  and  without  any  action  on the part of  Acquiror,  the  Acquiror
Stockholders,  the Company, the Company  Stockholders,  Merger Sub or the Merger
Sub Stockholder:

     (a) Company  Common Stock.  Each share of common stock,  $.01 par value per
share,  of  the  Company   ("Company   Common  Stock")  issued  and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(c)),  shall be converted,  subject
to Section 2.02(e), into the right to receive one-tenth of one share of Acquiror
Series A Preferred  Stock (the "Common  Stock Merger  Consideration").  All such
shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  shall no  longer  be  outstanding  and shall
automatically  be canceled  and shall cease to exist,  and each  certificate  or
other  instrument  previously  representing  any such  shares  shall  thereafter
represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of Acquiror
Series A  Preferred  Stock into which such shares of Company  Common  Stock were
converted  pursuant to the Merger and any cash,  without interest and subject to
the payment of any withholding taxes, in lieu of fractional shares. Certificates
or other  instruments  which prior to the Effective Time  represented  shares of
Company  Common Stock shall be exchanged  for  certificates  representing  whole
shares of Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock issued in  consideration  therefor
upon the surrender of such  certificates  or instruments in accordance  with the
provisions of Section 2.02,  without  interest.  No fractional share of Acquiror
Series A Preferred Stock shall be issued,  and, in lieu thereof,  a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to Section 2.02(e)  hereof.  In any event, if between the
date of this Merger  Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding  shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a different  number of shares
or  a  different   class,  by  reason  of  any  stock   dividend,   subdivision,
reclassification,  recapitalization,  split,  combination or exchange of shares,
the nature of the  consideration to be received by the Company  Stockholders and
the Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and correspondingly
adjusted  to  reflect  such  stock  dividend,   subdivision,   reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

     (b) Company  Preferred Stock.  (i) Each share of preferred stock,  $.01 par
value per share,  of the Company (the  "Company  Preferred  Stock"),  issued and
outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time (other than any shares of
Company Preferred Stock to be canceled  pursuant to Section  2.01(c)),  shall be
converted into the right to receive from the Acquiror:

          (A) (i) a number  of  shares  of XM Class A Stock  equal to 9  million
     divided by the number of  outstanding  shares of  Company  Preferred  Stock
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any
     cash dividends or other distributions  declared or made between the date of
     this Merger  Agreement and the Effective Time with respect to the shares of
     XM Class A Stock referred to in clause (A)(i);

          (B) an amount of cash  equal to (x) the sum of the  following  amounts
     (the "Guaranteed Amount"): (i) the principal amount, if any, of each of the
     Tranche B Term  Loans  and the  Tranche  C Term  Loans  (as such  terms are
     defined  in the Term  Credit  Agreement)  under the Term  Credit  Agreement
     outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time minus (ii) the Term
     Loan Reduction Amount plus (iii) the aggregate  amount,  if any, of each of
     the Tranche B Commitments  and the Tranche C Commitments (as such terms are
     defined in the  Revolving  Credit  Agreement,  and,  in each case,  whether
     utilized or unutilized)  under the Revolving Credit  Agreement  outstanding
     immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  minus (iv) the  Revolving  Loan
     Reduction  Amount,  divided  by (y) the  number  of  outstanding  shares of
     Company  Preferred  Stock issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to the
     Effective Time; and

          (C)  if  required  by the  next  sentence,  a  Discrepancy  Note  (the
     consideration  described  in clauses (A),  (B) and (C),  collectively,  the
     "Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration"  and together with the Common Stock
     Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

In the event that (i) the  product of (x) the XM Share  Price as of the  Closing
Date  and (y) 9  million  plus  (ii)  the  value  of cash  dividends  and  other
distributions  received, if any, pursuant to clause (A)(ii) above plus (iii) the
Guaranteed  Amount  (the  "Original  Consideration  Value")  is less  than  $115
million, then each share of Company Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
(in addition to the  consideration set forth in (A) and (B) above), a promissory
note (the  "Discrepancy  Note") in substantially  the form to be attached to the
Discrepancy Note Agreement as Exhibit A thereto in the principal amount (rounded
up or down to the  nearest  whole cent) of the excess of $115  million  over the
Original  Consideration  Value (the "Principal Amount") multiplied by a fraction
the  numerator  of which is one and the  denominator  of which is the  aggregate
number of shares of Company  Preferred Stock issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each  Discrepancy Note will be subject to the terms
and  conditions  set forth in, and shall be secured  as  provided  in, the Note,
Pledge and Security  Agreement  which shall be based on the summary of terms and
conditions  set  forth in  Exhibit B and  which  shall be in form and  substance
reasonably  satisfactory  to the Acquiror and the  Preferred  Stockholders  (the
"Discrepancy Note Agreement").

          (ii)  Effective at the  Effective  Time,  subject to  satisfaction  or
     waiver of each of the  conditions  precedent set forth in Article VII (with
     any waivers of  conditions  set forth in Section  7.04 to be  consented  in
     writing  by  the  Preferred  Stockholders),  all  such  shares  of  Company
     Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically  be
     canceled and shall cease to exist.  Certificates or other instruments which
     prior to the Effective Time represented  shares of Company  Preferred Stock
     shall  be  exchanged  for  the  Preferred  Stock  Merger  Consideration  in
     consideration   therefor  upon  the  surrender  of  such   certificates  or
     instruments  without  interest.   The  holders  of  certificates  or  other
     instruments which prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
     Preferred  Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
     as otherwise  provided herein or by law. No fractional  share of XM Class A
     Stock shall be paid,  and, in lieu  thereof,  a cash payment  shall be made
     pursuant to Section  2.02(e)  hereof.  In any event, if between the date of
     this Merger  Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding  shares of XM
     Class A Stock shall have been changed into a different  number of shares or
     a  different   class,  by  reason  of  any  stock  dividend,   subdivision,
     reclassification,  recapitalization,  split,  combination  or  exchange  of
     shares,  the nature of the  consideration  to be received by the holders of
     the Company  Preferred  Stock shall be  appropriately  and  correspondingly
     adjusted to reflect  such stock  dividend,  subdivision,  reclassification,
     recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

     (c)  Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Any shares of Company Common Stock and
Company  Preferred  Stock held in the  treasury of the Company and any shares of
Company  Common  Stock and Company  Preferred  Stock owned by Acquiror or by any
Acquiror  Subsidiary  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and  extinguished  without any  conversion  thereof and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

     (d) Merger Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted  into and become one fully paid and  nonassessable  share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.


         SECTION 2.02.  Exchange of Certificates or Instruments.

     (a) Exchange  Agent.  Promptly  after the Effective  Time,  Acquiror  shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with First Chicago Trust Company of New
York, a Division of Equiserve,  or another bank or trust  company  designated by
Acquiror and reasonably  acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange  Agent"),  for
the benefit of the holders of issued and  outstanding  Company  Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable,  for exchange through the Exchange Agent
in accordance with this Article II, (i) certificates  representing the number of
shares of  Acquiror  Series A  Preferred  Stock  equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company  Common  Stock  issued and  outstanding  immediately
prior to the  Effective  Time  (other  than any shares of Company  Common  Stock
canceled  pursuant  to Section  2.01(c))  and (y)  one-tenth,  rounded up to the
nearest whole share, (ii)  certificates  representing the number of whole shares
of XM Class A Stock payable to holders of Company  Preferred  Stock  pursuant to
Section 2.01(b),  (iii) if applicable,  Discrepancy Notes issuable to holders of
Company Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(b),  and (iv) cash in an amount
sufficient  to permit  payment  of the cash  payable  to the  holders of Company
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section  2.01(b) (such amounts of cash,  Discrepancy
Notes (if any), and certificates for shares of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock
and XM Class A Stock,  together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent
shall,  pursuant to irrevocable  instructions from Acquiror,  deliver out of the
Exchange Fund the Merger Consideration to be issued and paid.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or  certificates  of Company  Preferred Stock or Company
Common  Stock  which   immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  represented
outstanding  shares of  Company  Preferred  Stock or Company  Common  Stock (the
"Certificates")  (i) a letter of transmittal  (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected,  and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates  shall pass,
only upon proper  delivery of the  Certificates  to the Exchange Agent and which
shall be in  customary  form) and (ii)  instructions  for use in  effecting  the
surrender  of  the   Certificates  in  exchange  for  the  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration,  as the case may be.
Upon  surrender of a Certificate  for  cancellation  to the Exchange  Agent,  as
specified  in  such  letter  of  transmittal,   together  with  such  letter  of
transmittal,  duly  executed,  and such other  Documents  as may  reasonably  be
required pursuant to such instructions,  the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive  promptly in exchange  therefor,  as applicable,  the Common
Stock Merger  Consideration  or the Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration  which
such  holder has the right to receive  in respect of such  Certificate  together
with any  dividends  or other  distributions  to which such  holder is  entitled
pursuant to Section  2.02(c) and cash in lieu of  fractional  shares of Acquiror
Series A  Preferred  Stock or XM Class A Stock to which such  holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e).  The Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Preferred
Stock or Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
the  Company,  the  proper  Common  Stock  Merger  Consideration  or the  proper
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration,  as the case may be, may be issued and the
proper  amount  of cash  may be paid  pursuant  hereto  to a  transferee  if the
Certificates  representing  such  shares of Company  Preferred  Stock or Company
Common Stock,  properly  endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer,  are
presented  to the  Exchange  Agent,  accompanied  by all  Documents  required to
evidence and effect such  transfer  and by evidence  that any  applicable  stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each  Certificate  shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent  only the right to receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration,  as the case may be,
together  with any  dividends  or other  distributions  to which such  holder is
entitled  pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional  shares
of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock or XM Class A Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable pursuant to Section  2.01(b)(i)(B),  Section 2.02(c) or Section
2.02(e).

     (c)  Distributions  with  Respect to  Unexchanged  Shares.  No principal or
interest on any  Discrepancy  Notes,  and no  dividends  or other  distributions
declared or made after the  Effective  Time with  respect to  Acquiror  Series A
Preferred Stock or XM Class A Stock with a record date after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
Discrepancy Notes or the whole shares of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock or XM
Class  A  Stock  represented  thereby,  until  the  holder  of  record  of  such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.  Subject to the effect of escheat,
tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of  Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock  issued in  exchange  therefor,  without
interest,  (i)  promptly,  the  amount of any cash  payable  with  respect  to a
fractional  share of Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock to which such holder is
entitled  pursuant  to  Section  2.02(e)  and the amount of  dividends  or other
distributions  with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore  paid
with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date  occurring  after  surrender,  payable with respect to such whole shares of
Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock.  Subject to the effect of  escheat,  tax or
other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,  there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of XM
Class A Stock issued in exchange therefor,  without interest,  (i) promptly, the
amount of any cash  payable  with  respect to a  fractional  share of XM Class A
Stock to which such  holder is  entitled  pursuant  to Section  2.02(e)  and the
amount  of  dividends  or other  distributions  with a  record  date  after  the
Effective  Time and  theretofore  paid with  respect to such whole  shares of XM
Class A Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,  payable with respect to
such whole shares of XM Class A Stock.  Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or
other  applicable  laws,  promptly  following  surrender of any such Certificate
there shall be paid to the holder of any  Discrepancy  Notes  issued in exchange
therefor,  any principal and/or interest  theretofore due under such Discrepancy
Notes.

     (d) No Further Rights in Company  Preferred  Stock or Company Common Stock.
The Merger Consideration issued upon exchange of the shares of Company Preferred
Stock or Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid  pursuant to Section  2.02(c) or Section  2.02(e))  shall be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be.

     (e) No Fractional Shares.

          (i) No fractional shares of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock shall be
     issued  upon  surrender  for  exchange  of the  Certificates,  and any such
     fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
     any rights of a stockholder of Acquiror, but in lieu thereof each holder of
     shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
     fraction of a share of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock,  shall receive an
     amount in cash as set forth in this Section 2.02(e).

          (ii) As promptly as  practicable  following  the Effective  Time,  the
     Exchange  Agent shall  determine the  difference  between (x) the number of
     full shares of Acquiror  Series A Preferred Stock delivered to the Exchange
     Agent by  Acquiror,  which  shall  equal the  product  of (A) the number of
     shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
     the Effective  Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock canceled
     pursuant to Section  2.01(c)) and (B) one-tenth,  rounded up to the nearest
     whole  share,  and (y) the sum of the  number of full  shares  of  Acquiror
     Series A Preferred Stock to be distributed to each holder of Company Common
     Stock (such excess being herein called the "Excess Shares").  As soon after
     the Effective Time as  practicable,  the Exchange  Agent, as agent for such
     holders of Series A Preferred  Stock,  shall sell the Excess  Shares at the
     then  prevailing  prices on the Nasdaq National  Market,  all in the manner
     provided in Section 2.02(e)(iii).

          (iii) The sale of the Excess  Shares by the  Exchange  Agent  shall be
     executed on the Nasdaq  National Market through one or more member firms of
     the NASD and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The
     Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the
     Excess Shares as promptly  following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange
     Agent's reasonable judgment,  is practicable  consistent with obtaining the
     best  execution  of such sales in light of  prevailing  market  conditions.
     Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been  distributed  to
     such holders of Company  Common  Stock,  the Exchange  Agent will hold such
     proceeds in trust for such holders of Company Common Stock.  Acquiror shall
     pay all  commissions,  transfer taxes and other  out-of-pocket  transaction
     costs of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection  with such sale or sales
     of Excess  Shares.  In addition,  Acquiror  shall pay the Exchange  Agent's
     compensation  and  expenses  in  connection  with such  sale or sales.  The
     Exchange  Agent shall  determine  the portion of such net proceeds to which
     each  holder  of  Company  Common  Stock  shall  be  entitled,  if any,  by
     multiplying  the amount of the  aggregate  net  proceeds by a fraction  the
     numerator  of which is the  number of the  fractional  shares to which such
     holder of Company Common Stock is entitled and the  denominator of which is
     the aggregate  number of fractional  shares to which all holders of Company
     Common Stock are entitled.

          (iv) As soon as practicable  after the  determination of the amount of
     cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to
     any fractional share interests,  the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
     amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock.

          (v) No  fractional  shares of XM Class A Stock  shall be  issued  upon
     surrender for exchange of the  Certificates,  and any such fractional share
     interests  will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
     stockholder  of XM, but in lieu  thereof  each  holder of shares of Company
     Preferred  Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
     share of XM Class A Stock, after aggregating all Certificates  delivered by
     such holder, and rounding down to the nearest whole share, shall receive an
     amount  in cash  equal  to the  closing  price  of XM  Class A Stock on the
     Closing Date (as defined in Section  2.08)  multiplied by the fraction of a
     share of XM Class A Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
     Such payments in lieu of  fractional  shares shall be  administered  by the
     Exchange Agent pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.02(b).

     (f)  Termination  of Exchange  Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains  undistributed  to the  holders  of  Company  Common  Stock and  Company
Preferred  Stock for six (6) months after the Effective  Time shall be delivered
to Acquiror,  upon  demand.  Any holders of Company  Preferred  Stock or Company
Common  Stock  who have not  theretofore  complied  with this  Article  II shall
thereafter look only to Acquiror for the Merger  Consideration to which they are
entitled  pursuant to Section 2.01,  any dividends or other  distributions  with
respect to Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock or XM Class A Stock to which they
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), any principal or interest with respect
to Discrepancy  Notes to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Series A Preferred Stock or XM
Class A Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e).

     (g) No Liability.  None of Acquiror, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation  or the Exchange  Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger
Consideration  (or  dividends or  distributions  with  respect  thereto) or cash
delivered to a public official  pursuant to any abandoned  property,  escheat or
similar Laws.

     (h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates or Instruments. In the event any
certificate evidencing shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  the Exchange  Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  certificate,  upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,  such Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such shares and cash, if any, as may be required  pursuant to this
Article II; provided,  however,  that the Exchange Agent or Acquiror may, in its
reasonable  discretion  and as a condition  precedent to the  issuance  thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or instrument to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably  direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against  Acquiror or the  Exchange  Agent with respect to
the certificate or instrument alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.


         SECTION 2.03.  Stock Transfer Books.

     At the Effective  Time,  the stock  transfer  books of the Company shall be
closed and there  shall be no further  registration  of  transfers  of shares of
Company Securities  thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective  Time,  the  holders of  certificates  representing  shares of Company
Securities  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights  with  respect to such  shares of Company  Securities  except as
otherwise provided herein or by Law.


         SECTION 2.04.  Company Stock Options

     Prior to the  Effective  Time,  the  Company and  Acquiror  shall take such
action as may be necessary  or  appropriate  for Acquiror to assume,  or, at its
option, to issue a substitute option with respect to, each outstanding unexpired
and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively,
the "Company  Stock  Options")  under the  Company's  Amended and Restated  1998
Long-Term  Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated  Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
and Amended and Restated  Equity Plan for Directors and those options issued not
pursuant to such plans (collectively,  the "Company Stock Plans") so that at the
Effective Time each Company Stock Option will become or be replaced by an option
to purchase a number of whole shares of Acquiror  Series A Preferred Stock equal
to the  product of  one-tenth  (0.1) and the number of shares of Company  Common
Stock  subject to such Company Stock Options under the Company Stock Option (and
rounding any fractional  share down to the nearest whole share),  at an exercise
price per share  equal to the  product  of the shares of  Company  Common  Stock
subject to such Company  Stock  Option and the exercise  price per share of such
Company Stock Option, divided by the number of whole shares of Acquiror Series A
Preferred  Stock deemed to be purchasable  pursuant to such Company Stock Option
rounded up to the nearest whole cent; provided,  however, that upon an Automatic
Conversion Event (as such term is defined in the Restated Charter), each Company
Stock  Option  will  become or be  replaced by an option to purchase a number of
whole  shares of  Acquiror  Common  Stock  equal to the product of the number of
shares of Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock then subject to the Company  Stock
Options  and the number of shares of Acquiror  Common  Stock  issuable  upon the
Automatic  Conversion  Event  with  respect  to a share  of  Acquiror  Series  A
Preferred  Stock (and  rounding any  fractional  share down to the nearest whole
share),  at an  exercise  price per share  equal to the product of the shares of
Acquiror  Series A Preferred  Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option,  divided by the number of
whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock deemed to be purchasable  pursuant to such
Company Stock Option  rounded up to the nearest  whole cent (each,  an "Acquiror
Option").  The date of grant of each substituted Acquiror Option for purposes of
such  terms  and  conditions  shall  be  deemed  to be the  date  on  which  the
corresponding Company Stock Option was granted. As to each assumed Company Stock
Option,  at the  Effective  Time (a) all  references to the Company in the stock
option  agreements with respect to the Company Stock Options being assumed shall
be deemed to refer to Acquiror;  (b) Acquiror  shall assume all of the Company's
obligations  with respect to the related Company Stock Option;  and (c) Acquiror
shall issue to each holder of a Company Stock Option a document  evidencing  the
foregoing assumption by Acquiror.  Nothing in this Section 2.04 shall affect the
schedule of vesting with respect to the Company Stock Options in accordance with
the terms of such Company Stock Options.  It is the purpose and intention of the
parties that,  subject to applicable  Law, the  assumption of such Company Stock
Options or the  substitution  of Acquiror  Options for the Company Stock Options
shall meet the  requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and that each assumed
Company  Stock  Option  or  the   substituted   Acquiror  Option  shall  qualify
immediately  after the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent that the related  Company  Stock Option so
qualified  immediately before the Effective Time and the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.04 shall be  interpreted  to further such purpose and  intention.
The Company  represents  and warrants  that the  assumption of the Company Stock
Options or substitution of Acquiror  Options  therefor,  as contemplated by this
Section 2.04, may be effected pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Options
and the Company Stock Plans without the consent of any holder of a Company Stock
Option and without liability to any such holder.


         SECTION 2.05.  Company Warrants.

     At the  Effective  Time,  Acquiror  shall  assume each  warrant to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Warrants") so that at
the Effective Time each Company  Warrant will (a) become a warrant to purchase a
number of whole shares of Acquiror Series A Non-Voting  Preferred Stock equal to
(i) one-tenth  (0.1) times (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Company  Warrant was  exercisable at the Effective Time (and rounding
any fractional share down to the nearest whole share),  and (b) have an exercise
price per share equal to (i) the exercise price for the shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company  Warrant  immediately  prior to the Effective Time
divided by (ii)  one-tenth  (0.1);  provided,  however,  that upon an  Automatic
Conversion Event (as such term is defined in the Restated Charter), each Company
Warrant  will (A)  become a warrant  to  purchase  a number  of whole  shares of
Acquiror Non-Voting Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Acquiror  Non-Voting  Series A  Preferred  Stock  then  subject  to the  Company
Warrants and the number of shares of Acquiror  Non-Voting  Common Stock issuable
upon  the  Automatic  Conversion  Event  with  respect  to a share  of  Acquiror
Non-Voting  Series A Preferred Stock (and rounding any fractional  share down to
the nearest whole share),  and (B) have an exercise price per share equal to the
product of the shares of Acquiror Non-Voting Series A Preferred Stock subject to
such Company  Warrant and the exercise  price per share of such Company  Warrant
divided by the number of whole shares of Acquiror Non-Voting Common Stock deemed
to be  purchasable  pursuant to such Company  Warrant  rounded up to the nearest
whole cent (each, an "Acquiror Warrant"). As to each assumed Company Warrant, at
the Effective Time (x) all  references to the Company in the warrant  agreements
with respect to the Company  Warrants  being assumed shall be deemed to refer to
Acquiror;  (y)  Acquiror  shall  assume all of the  Company's  obligations  with
respect to the related  Company  Warrant;  and (z) Acquiror  shall issue to each
holder of a Company  Warrant a document  evidencing the foregoing  assumption by
Acquiror.


         SECTION 2.06.  Purchase of Tranche B and Tranche C Interests.

     (a) New Lenders. At the Effective Time, the Preferred Stockholders,  any of
their affiliates or any of their designees (any such purchaser,  a "New Lender")

     are defined in the Term Credit  Agreement)  under the Term Credit Agreement

     equal to (A) the aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Term Loans and the
     Tranche C Term Loans  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time
     plus any  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  thereon  minus  (B) the Term Loan

     Commitments) (collectively,  the "Revolver Commitments"), as all such terms
     are defined in the  Revolving  Credit  Agreement,  if any, in an  aggregate
     principal amount equal to (A) Tranche B Commitments  (including any Tranche
     B Loans outstanding with respect to such Tranche B Commitments) and Tranche
     C Commitments  (including any Tranche C Loans  outstanding  with respect to
     such Tranche C Commitments) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
     Time plus any accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon minus (B) the Revolving
     Loan Reduction Amount;

     provided,  that the  aggregate  amount  of such  Term  Loans  and  Revolver
Commitments  so  purchased  shall  in no event  exceed  the  Guaranteed  Amount;
provided,  further, that immediately prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
have paid (or caused its applicable  Acquiror Subsidiary to pay) in full in cash
all unpaid interest (as of the Effective  Time) on, and any other fees,  claims,
indemnifications  or  other  amounts  accrued  and  owing  up to  and  as of the
Effective  Time,  whether or not then required to be paid, (1) in respect of all

     Waiver)  in  respect  of such Term  Loans  shall  have been  terminated  as
     contemplated by the Bank Waiver, and

          (B) one or more Persons selected by the New Lenders (which Persons may
     be affiliates of any New Lenders, any such Person, a "New Guarantor") shall
     have  guaranteed  the  obligations in respect of such Term Loans to the New
     Lenders pursuant to documentation  substantially similar to the Shareholder
     Guaranties and the Shareholder  Guarantor Security Agreement (as such terms

          (B) the New  Guarantors  shall  have  guaranteed  the  obligations  in
     respect  of such  Revolver  Commitments  to the  New  Lenders  pursuant  to

     instruments relating thereto or in connection therewith (collectively,  the

satisfactory  to, the New  Guarantors  and the New  Lenders  (collectively,  the
"Tranche B and C Documents") and the Acquiror shall have obtained the consent of
each other Person that may be required to effect such transactions.


         SECTION 2.07.  Stock Options.

     The  Company  and  Acquiror  agree  to  discuss  in  good  faith  potential
modifications  to  outstanding  options  under the  Company  Stock Plans and the
Acquiror Stock Plans, which  modifications would better ensure that employees of
both companies are treated fairly and appropriately  incented.  Acquiror and the

any modifications agreed to by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.07.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THe company

     Except as  disclosed  in the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule  (the  "Company
Disclosure   Schedule")   delivered   to  Acquiror   separately   prior  to,  or
contemporaneously  with, the date hereof (which disclosure schedule shall make a
specific  reference  to the  particular  Section or  subsection  of this  Merger
Agreement  to which  exception  is being  taken),  the  Company  represents  and
warrants to Acquiror that:


         SECTION 3.01.  Corporate Existence and Power.

     The Company is a corporation  duly  incorporated,  validly  existing and in
good  standing  under the laws of the State of Delaware,  and has all  corporate
powers  required to carry on its business as now conducted.  The Company is duly
qualified  to do business as a foreign  corporation  and is in good  standing in
each  jurisdiction  where the character of the property owned or leased by it or
the nature of its activities makes such  qualification  necessary,  except where
the failure to be so qualified,  individually or in the aggregate,  would not be
reasonably  likely to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect.  Schedule 3.01 of
the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a complete and correct list of the
states  in  which  the  Company  is  qualified  to  do  business  as  a  foreign
corporation.  The Company has  heretofore  made  available to Acquiror  true and
complete  copies of the Company's  certificate  of  incorporation  and bylaws as

Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby are within the  Company's  corporate  powers and,  except for the Company
Stockholder  Approval,  have been duly  authorized  by all  necessary  corporate
action.  Assuming that this Merger  Agreement  constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Acquiror and Merger Sub, this Merger Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company,  enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium and similar laws,
now or  hereafter  in effect,  relating to or  affecting  creditors'  rights and
remedies and to general principles of equity.


         SECTION 3.03.  Governmental Authorization.

     The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  by the  Company of this Merger
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with,  any  Governmental
Entity other than (a) the filing of (i) a  certificate  of merger in  accordance
with Delaware Law and (ii) appropriate  documents with the relevant  authorities
of other states or jurisdictions in which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary
is qualified to do business; (b) compliance with any applicable  requirements of
the HSR Act; (c) compliance  with any applicable  requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act; (d) compliance with any applicable state securities or
blue  sky  laws;  and (e)  such  other  consents,  approvals,  actions,  orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings that, if not obtained or
made, would not,  individually or in the aggregate,  (i) be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) prevent or materially impair the
ability of the  Company to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Merger Agreement.


         SECTION 3.04.  Non-Contravention.

     The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  by the  Company of this Merger

hereby do not and will not (a)  contravene or conflict with the Company's or any
Company  Subsidiary's  certificate  of  incorporation  or bylaws,  (b)  assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.03,  contravene or conflict
with  or  constitute  a  violation  of any  provision  of any  law,  regulation,
judgment,  injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable to the Company
or any Company  Subsidiary,  (c)  constitute  a default  under or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of
the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  or to a loss of any benefit or status to
which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary is entitled  under any provision of
any Agreement binding upon the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any license,
franchise,  permit or other  similar  authorization  held by the  Company or any
Company  Subsidiary,  or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  other than,  in the case of
each of (b), (c) and (d), any such items that would not,  individually or in the
aggregate (i) be reasonably  likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) prevent or materially  impair the ability of the Company to consummate  the
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement.


         SECTION 3.05.  Capitalization.

     (a) As of the date  hereof,  the  authorized  capital  stock of the Company

     (b) As of the date hereof,  except (i) as set forth in Section 3.05(a), and

Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of (i) the  ownership  interests

documents  required  to be filed by it with the SEC since  January 1,  1999.  No
Company  Subsidiary  is subject to the reporting  requirements  of Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and no Company  Subsidiary  is an  investment  company
registered  or required to be  registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940.

     (b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied as to form in
all material  respects with the  applicable  requirements  of the Securities Act
and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be.

     (c) No Company SEC Document  filed  pursuant to the Exchange Act contained,
as of its filing date,  any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitted to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements  made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Company SEC Document, as amended or supplemented,  if applicable, filed pursuant
to the  Securities  Act  contained,  as of the date such  document or  amendment
became  effective,  any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any  material  fact  required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  to make the
statements therein not misleading.


         SECTION 3.08.Financial Statements; No Material Undisclosed Liabilities.

     (a)  The  audited   consolidated   financial   statements   and   unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company
10-K and the Company 10-Q fairly present in all material respects, in conformity
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a consistent  basis
("GAAP")  (except as may be  indicated  in the notes  thereto  and  except  that
financial  statements included in the Company 10-Q do not contain all GAAP notes
to such  financial  statements),  the  consolidated  financial  position  of the
Company and its  consolidated  Company  Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their  consolidated  results of operations and changes in financial position for
the periods then ended  (subject to normal  year-end  adjustments in the case of
any unaudited interim financial statements).

     (b) There are no  liabilities  of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary of
any  kind  whatsoever,   whether  accrued,  contingent,   absolute,  determined,
determinable  or  otherwise,  in each case,  that are required by GAAP to be set
forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, other than:

          (i)  liabilities  or  obligations  disclosed  or  provided  for in the
     Company Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto;

          (ii)  liabilities  or  obligations  under  this  Merger  Agreement  or
     incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;

          (iii)  liabilities or obligations  incurred in the Ordinary  Course of
     Business;  provided, that, any such liabilities or obligations,  whether or
     not incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business,  constituting Indebtedness
     shall be disclosed  pursuant to Section  3.08(b)(i) to the extent that such
     Indebtedness matures or requires scheduled payments to be made on or before
     the date which is 365 days after the End Date; and

          (iv)  liabilities  or  obligations  not required to be disclosed  (due
     solely to materiality,  knowledge or other applicable  qualifiers or dollar
     limitations) in the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  pursuant to the terms of
     the applicable provisions requiring such disclosure;  provided,  that, such
     liabilities  or  obligations  in the  aggregate  do not result in a Company
     Material Adverse Effect.


         SECTION 3.09.  Information to Be Supplied.

     (a) The  information to be supplied by the Company  expressly for inclusion
or  incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement will (i) in the case
of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, not contain any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the  statements  therein not
misleading  and (ii) in the case of the remainder of the Joint Proxy  Statement,
at the time of the mailing thereof,  and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting,  not contain any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to state
any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not  misleading.  The  Joint  Proxy  Statement  will  comply  (with  respect  to
information  relating to the Company) as to form in all material  respects  with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

     (b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Joint Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Acquiror.


         SECTION 3.10.  Absence of Certain Changes.

     Since December 31, 2000, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Merger Agreement,  the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
business only in the ordinary  course  consistent  with past practice and, since
such date, there has not been (a) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss
(whether or not covered by  insurance)  affecting  the business or Assets of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary that,  individually or in the aggregate,  has
had or would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b)
any change in the  business,  operations,  properties,  condition  (financial or
otherwise),  Assets or liabilities  (including,  without limitation,  contingent
liabilities) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary having, individually or in
the  aggregate,  a Company  Material  Adverse  Effect,  (c) any  action,  event,
occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that, individually or
in the  aggregate,  has had or  would be  reasonably  likely  to have a  Company
Material  Adverse  Effect,  or (d) any  Agreement  by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary  to take any of the actions  described in this Section 3.10 except as
expressly  contemplated  by this  Merger  Agreement.  Except for the  payment of
scheduled  non-cash  dividends  in  accordance  with the  terms  of the  Company
Preferred  Stock,  between  December  31,  2000  and the  date  of  this  Merger
Agreement,  neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary has taken, or agreed
to take,  any action that would  constitute  a material  breach of Section  5.01
(except for  clauses  (j),  (m) or (n)  thereof) if taken after the date of this
Merger Agreement.


         SECTION 3.11.  Litigation.

     As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation, arbitration
or proceeding  pending  against,  or to the knowledge of the Company  threatened
against, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets
or  properties  before  any  arbitrator  or  Governmental  Entity  that  is  not
identified  on Schedule  3.11 of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule,  which would
reasonably  be expected  to result in monetary  damages in excess of $100,000 or
any restriction,  in any material respect,  on the business or operations of the
Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary.  None of the  foregoing  matters  would be
reasonably  likely  to have a  Company  Material  Adverse  Effect.  There are no
outstanding injunctions against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and there
are no outstanding  judgments,  decrees,  awards,  or orders with respect to the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary  which have not been  satisfied  and complied
with in full or which require the Company or any Company  Subsidiary to take, or
refrain from taking, action in the future.


         SECTION 3.12.  Contracts.

     (a) As of the date hereof, the exhibit index to the Company's most recently
filed Annual Report on Form 10-K,  as  supplemented  by Schedule  3.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure  Schedule,  includes each contract  (including all amendments
thereto) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of them is bound and (i) which would be  required,  pursuant to the Exchange
Act and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  to be filed as an exhibit to an
Annual Report of the Company on Form 10-K, a Quarterly  Report of the Company on

whether such report is now due to be filed) or (ii)  involves  payments by or to
the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  in excess of $1 million in calendar year
2001 or any subsequent  calendar year (collectively,  the "Company  Contracts").
Schedule  3.12(a) of the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule  indicates  which of the
Company  Contracts  have  terminated,  and which of the  Company  Contracts  are
scheduled to terminate in accordance with their respective terms, in 2001.

     (b) Each Company Contract is in full force and effect,  constitutes a valid
and binding  obligation of and is legally  enforceable  in  accordance  with its
terms  against  the Company or Company  Subsidiary,  as  applicable  and, to the
knowledge  of the  Company,  (i) the Company  Contracts  are valid,  binding and
enforceable   obligations  of  the  other  parties   thereto,   except  as  such
enforceability  may be subject  to the  effects  of any  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  fraudulent conveyance,  reorganization,  moratorium or similar Laws
affecting  creditors'  rights  generally  or subject  to the  effects of general
equitable  principles  (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(ii) the  Company  and/or  each  Company  Subsidiary,  as the  case may be,  has
complied  with all of the  provisions  of such Company  Contracts  and is not in
default thereunder,  and there has not occurred any event which (whether with or
without  notice,  lapse of time,  or the  happening or  occurrence  of any other
event)  would  constitute  such a  default,  and the  execution  of this  Merger
Agreement by the Company and its performance hereunder will not cause, or result
in, a breach or default under any Company Contract; (iii) there has not been (A)
any failure by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary,  any other party to any such Company Contract
to comply with all material provisions  thereof,  (B) any default by the Company
or any Company  Subsidiary  or, to the  knowledge  of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary,  any other party  thereunder  or (C) to the knowledge of the Company
(1) any  cancellation  thereof  in  writing  which has not been cured or (2) any
outstanding dispute thereunder which has not been cured.

     (c)  Neither  the Company  nor any  Company  Subsidiary  is a guarantor  or
otherwise liable for any liability or obligation (including Indebtedness) of any
Portfolio  Company or other Person other than a wholly owned  subsidiary  of the
Company.

     (d) No officer,  director or significant  stockholder of the Company or any
Company  Subsidiary,  or  affiliate  of such  officer,  director or  significant
stockholder,  is  currently  a  party  to  any  transaction,   understanding  or
commitment  with the  Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary,  including,  without
limitation,  any  Agreement  providing  for the  employment  of,  furnishing  of
services  by,  rental of Assets  from or to,  requiring  payments on a change of
control of the Company or otherwise  requiring  payments  to, any such  officer,
director,  significant  stockholder  or  affiliate,  except  for the  payment of
benefits to officers or directors in the Ordinary Course of Business.

     (e)  Neither  the  Company  nor any  Company  Subsidiary  is a party to any
contract with the United States  government or to any other material  Government
Contract.


         SECTION 3.13.  Taxes.

     Except  as would not be  reasonably  expected  to have a  Company  Material
Adverse Effect:

     (a) All Company Tax Returns  required to be filed with any Taxing authority
by, or with respect to, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been filed
in substantial compliance with all applicable laws.

     (b) The  Company and the  Company  Subsidiaries  have timely paid all Taxes
shown as due and payable on the Company Tax Returns  that have been so filed and
all other Taxes not  subject to  reporting  obligations,  and, as of the time of
filing, the Company Tax Returns were complete and correct (other than Taxes that
are being contested in good faith and for which adequate  reserves are reflected
on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP).

     (c) The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries have made adequate  provision
in  accordance  with GAAP for all Taxes payable by them for which no Company Tax
Return has yet been filed.

     (d) The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes.

     (e) The Company has not  received any written  notice of any action,  suit,
proceeding,  audit or claim now  proposed or pending  against or with respect to
the  Company or any Company  Subsidiary  in respect of any Tax that would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect

     (f) Neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary has been a member of an
affiliated,  consolidated, combined or unitary group other than one of which the
Company was the common parent.

     (g) Neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary holds any asset subject
to a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code.

     (h) The federal  income Tax Returns have been examined and settled with the
IRS (or the  applicable  statutes of  limitation  for the  assessment of federal
income Taxes for such periods have  expired)  for all years  through  1996.  The
parties  acknowledge that certain net operating loss carry overs generated prior
to 1997 may be unavailable in either 1997 or in subsequent years.

     (i) There are no  material  Encumbrances  for Taxes on any of the assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

     (j) Neither the  Company nor any Company  Subsidiary  is a party to any tax
allocation,  tax sharing,  tax indemnity or similar agreement (whether or not in
writing),  arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes  (including any adverse
pricing  agreement,  closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with
any taxing authority), except among themselves.


         SECTION 3.14.  Employee Benefits.

     (a)  Schedule  3.14(a)  of the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a
correct and complete list identifying each material  "employee benefit plan," as
defined  in  Section  3(3) of  ERISA,  each  employment,  severance  or  similar
contract,  plan,  arrangement  or  policy  and each  other  plan or  arrangement
(written or oral) providing for  compensation,  bonuses,  profit-sharing,  stock
option or other stock  related  rights or other forms of  incentive  or deferred
compensation,  vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements),   health  or  medical  benefits,  disability  benefits,  workers'
compensation,   supplemental  unemployment  benefits,   severance  benefits  and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health,
medical  or  life  insurance  benefits)  that  is  maintained,  administered  or
contributed  to by the Company or any ERISA  Affiliate  (as  defined  below) and
covers  any  employee,  former  employee,  officer,  director  or other  service
provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Copies of such plans (and, if
applicable,  related trust  agreements)  and all amendments  thereto and written
interpretations  thereof have been furnished to Acquiror  together with the most
recent annual report (Form 5500 including all applicable  schedules thereto) and
summary plan  description  prepared in connection with any such plan. Such plans
are referred to collectively herein as the "Company Benefit Plans." For purposes
of this Section  3.14,  "ERISA  Affiliate"  of any Person means any other Person
which,  together with such Person,  would be treated as a single  employer under
Section 414 of the Code.

     (b) No Company Benefit Plan constitutes a "multiemployer  plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a  "Multiemployer  Plan") and no Company Benefit Plan
is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Retirement Plan"),  including any terminated
Company Benefit Plans.  Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA  Affiliates has
incurred any liability  under Title IV of ERISA  arising in connection  with the
termination  of, or complete or partial  withdrawal  from,  any plan  covered or
previously covered by Title IV of ERISA.  Nothing has been done or omitted to be
done and no transaction or holding of any asset under or in connection  with any
Company  Benefit  Plan has  occurred  that will make the  Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
subject to any  liability  under Title I of ERISA or liable for any tax pursuant
to Section 4975 of the Code (assuming the taxable period of any such transaction
expired as of the date hereof) that would be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Each  Company  Benefit  Plan that is  intended  to be  qualified  under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified  during the
period  from its  adoption  to date,  and each trust  forming a part  thereof is
exempt  from tax  pursuant  to  Section  501(a) of the  Code.  The  Company  has
furnished  to  Acquiror  copies  of the most  recent  Internal  Revenue  Service
determination  letters,  if any, with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan.
Each Company  Benefit Plan has been  maintained in compliance with its terms and
with the  requirements  prescribed  by any and all statutes,  orders,  rules and
regulations,  including  but not  limited  to  ERISA  and the  Code,  which  are
applicable to such Company Benefit Plan, except for any compliance failures that
are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) There is no contract,  agreement, plan or arrangement that, as a result
of the Merger, would obligate the Company to make any payment of any amount that
would not be deductible  pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) or Section 280G
of the Code.

     (e) There has been no amendment to, written  interpretation or announcement
(whether or not  written)  relating to, or change in employee  participation  or
coverage  under,  any Company  Benefit  Plan that would  increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Benefit Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect  thereof  for the fiscal  year ended  December  31,  2000 except for any
increase  that is not  reasonably  likely  to have a  Company  Material  Adverse
Effect.

     (f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability under any
Company  Benefit Plan that is not a Retirement Plan that provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any  participant  or any  beneficiary  of a participant
after such participant's termination of employment, except as may be required by
Section  4980B of the Code or  Section  601 (et  seq.) of  ERISA,  or under  any
applicable  state law, and at the expense of the  participant or the beneficiary
of  the  participant.   No  Company  Benefit  Plan  is  a  Voluntary  Employees'
Beneficiary  Association ("VEBA") within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.  No Company  Benefit Plan is an Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan  ("ESOP")
within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

     (g) The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries  have not received  notice of
any  pending  unfair  labor  practice  charges,  contract  grievances  under any
collective  bargaining   agreement,   other  administrative   charges,   claims,
grievances or lawsuits before any court,  governmental agency,  regulatory body,
or arbiter arising under any Law governing any Company Benefit Plan, and, to the
Company's knowledge, there exist no facts that could give rise to such a claim.

     (h) There are no  arrangements,  agreements or plans pursuant to which cash
and non-cash  payments  will become  payable to any current or former  employee,
officer or director of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary as a result of the
Merger or a termination of service subsequent to the consummation of the Merger.
There  is  no  Company   Benefit  Plan  requiring   payments,   cancellation  of
Indebtedness or other  obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise
as a result of the consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Merger  Agreement or as a result of a termination  of service  subsequent to the
consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this Merger  Agreement,
with  respect to any  current or former  employee,  officer or  director  of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

     (i) Schedule 3.14(i) of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a true
and correct  description  of the  restructuring  actions  (including  downsizing
actions) undertaken by the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries between January
1, 2001 and the date hereof.

     (j) Schedule 3.14(j) of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a true
and correct  description of the option exchange program which was implemented by
the Company commencing in the fourth quarter of 2000.


         SECTION 3.15.Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and Registrations.

     (a) Neither the Company nor any Company  Subsidiary  is in violation of, or
has  violated,  any  applicable  provisions of any laws,  statutes,  ordinances,
regulations,  judgments,  injunctions, orders or consent decrees, except for any
such violations that, individually or in the aggregate,  would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) Each of the  Company  and the  Company  Subsidiaries  has all  permits,
licenses,  approvals,  authorizations  of and  registrations  with and under all
federal,  state,  local and foreign  laws,  and from all  Governmental  Entities
required  by the  Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries  to  carry  on  their
respective  businesses as currently conducted,  except where the failure to have
any  such  permits,  licenses,   approvals,   authorizations  or  registrations,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.


         SECTION 3.16.  Title to Properties.

     (a) The Company and each Company  Subsidiary have good and marketable title
to, or valid leasehold  interests in, all their properties and assets except for
such as are no longer  used or useful in the conduct of their  businesses  or as
have been disposed of in the Ordinary  Course of Business and except for defects
in title,  easements,  restrictive covenants and similar Liens,  encumbrances or
impediments that, in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the ability
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their business,  taken as
a whole,  as currently  conducted.  All such assets and  properties,  other than
assets  and  properties  in which the  Company  or any  Company  Subsidiary  has
leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens.

     (b) The Company and each  Company  Subsidiary  are in  compliance  with the
terms of all  leases  to which  they are a party  and  under  which  they are in
occupancy,  and all such leases are in full force and effect and the Company and
each Company Subsidiary enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
leases.


         SECTION 3.17.  Intellectual Property.

     (a) "Intellectual  Property" means trademarks,  service marks, trade names,
URLs,  domain names,  mask works, net lists,  schematics,  inventions,  patents,
trade secrets,  copyrights,  know-how, ideas, algorithms,  processes,  software,
technology  (including any registrations or applications for registration of any
of the foregoing) or any other similar type of proprietary intellectual property
right. "Company Intellectual  Property" means Intellectual Property necessary or
useful to carry on the  business of the  Company  and the Company  Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole,  as  currently  conducted.  Schedule  3.17(a)  of the  Company
Disclosure  Schedule  sets  forth a complete  and  correct  list of the  Company
Intellectual  Property  which is not readily  obtainable  on the open market for
such Intellectual  Property at market prices and is materially necessary for the
operation of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

     (b) The Company and the Company  Subsidiaries  have good and valid title to
or  have a  valid  and  enforceable  license  to use  the  Company  Intellectual
Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

     (c)  The  operation  of  the  business  of the  Company  and  each  Company
Subsidiary as currently conducted does not, and will not, assuming such business
is conducted  by the  Surviving  Corporation  in  substantially  the same manner
following the Closing,  infringe on any Intellectual  Property rights of others,
violate any right of any Person  (including  any right to privacy or publicity),
or  constitute  unfair  competition  or trade  practices  under  the laws of any
jurisdiction  in any  material  respect.  Neither  the  Company  nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written notice of infringement, misappropriation, or
violation  of or  challenge  to,  and  there are no  claims  pending  or, to the
Company's knowledge,  threatened with respect to the rights of others to the use
of, any Company Intellectual Property that, in any such case, individually or in
the aggregate,  would be reasonably  likely to have a Company  Material  Adverse
Effect.  The Company  Intellectual  Property  is not subject to any  outstanding
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge.

     (d) To the best of the  Company's  knowledge,  no third party is infringing
upon any of the Company Intellectual  Property, and the Company has not notified
any  third  party  that it  believes  such  third  party  is  interfering  with,
infringing,  or  misappropriating  any of the Company  Intellectual  Property or
engaging in any act of unfair competition. The Company has the right to bring an
action for the infringement of all of the Company Intellectual Property.

     (e) All necessary registration, maintenance, and renewal fees in connection
with Company  Intellectual  Property that is registered and owned by the Company
or any  Company  Subsidiary  have been filed with  relevant  patent,  copyright,
trademark or other  authorities  in the United  States and any other country for
the purposes of maintaining  such Company  Intellectual  Property.  In each case
where the  Company or any  Company  Subsidiary  has  acquired  any  Intellectual
Property from any Person,  the Company or any Company  Subsidiary has obtained a
valid and enforceable  assignment  sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights
acquired in such Intellectual Property to the Company or Company Subsidiary,  as
applicable.

     (f) The Company and each  Company  Subsidiary  have taken all  commercially
reasonable  steps that are  required to protect  the  Company  and each  Company
Subsidiary's rights in confidential information and trade secrets of the Company
and each  Company  Subsidiary  or provided by any other Person to the Company or
any Company  Subsidiary.  Without  limiting the foregoing,  the Company and each
Company Subsidiary have and enforce a policy requiring each employee,  director,
consultant  and  contractor  to  execute a  confidentiality  and  non-disclosure
agreement  substantially in the form previously  provided to Acquiror,  and each
present and former  employee,  director,  consultant and contractor has executed
such an agreement.

     (g) Neither this Merger Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Merger Agreement,  including the assignment to Acquiror,  by operation of law or
otherwise, of any Agreements to which the Company is a party, will result in (i)
the  Surviving  Corporation  granting  to  any  third  party  any  right  to any
Intellectual Property right owned by, or licensed to, the Surviving Corporation,
(ii) the Surviving Corporation being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or
other  restriction  on the  operation  or scope of the  Surviving  Corporation's
business,  or  (iii)  the  Surviving  Corporation  being  obligated  to pay  any
royalties or other  amounts to any third party in excess of those payable by the
Surviving Corporation prior to the Closing.  Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary  will be, as a result of the  execution  and  delivery of this Merger
Agreement or the  performance  of its  obligations  hereunder,  in breach of any
license,  sublicense  or other  Agreement  relating to the Company  Intellectual
Property.

     (h)  Schedule  3.17(h)  of the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a
complete and correct list of all contracts, licenses, and Agreements relating to
the Company  Intellectual  Property  which is not readily  available on the open
market  for such  Intellectual  Property  at  market  prices  and is  materially
necessary for the operation of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries  in the
Ordinary Course of Business to which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary is a
party or to which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary  is bound.  Neither the
Company nor any Company  Subsidiary is in breach and neither the Company nor any
Company  Subsidiary has failed to perform under any of the foregoing  contracts,
licenses or Agreements  and, to the Company's  knowledge,  no other party to any
such  contract,  license,  or  Agreement  is in breach  thereof or has failed to
perform  thereunder,  and, to the Company's  knowledge,  there are no threatened
disputes  or  disagreements  with  respect  to  such  contracts,   licenses,  or
Agreements.  No person who has licensed  Intellectual Property to the Company or
any Company  Subsidiary has ownership  rights or license rights to  improvements

or  otherwise,  in each  case,  that are  required  by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of Acquiror, other than:

          (i)  liabilities  or  obligations  disclosed  or  provided  for in the
     Acquiror Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto;

          (ii)  liabilities  or  obligations  under  this  Merger  Agreement  or
     incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;

          (iii)  liabilities or obligations  incurred in the Ordinary  Course of
     Business;  provided, that, any such liabilities or obligations,  whether or
     not incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business,  constituting Indebtedness
     shall be disclosed  pursuant to Section  4.08(b)(i) to the extent that such
     Indebtedness matures or requires scheduled payments to be made on or before
     the date which is 365 days after the End Date; and

          (iv)  liabilities  or  obligations  not required to be disclosed  (due
     solely to materiality,  knowledge or other applicable  qualifiers or dollar
     limitations) in the Acquiror  Disclosure  Schedule pursuant to the terms of
     the applicable provisions requiring such disclosure;  provided,  that, such
     liabilities  or  obligations  in the aggregate do not result in an Acquiror
     Material Adverse Effect.


         SECTION 4.09.  Information to Be Supplied.

     (a) The  information to be supplied by Acquiror  expressly for inclusion or
incorporation  by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement will (i) in the case of
the Registration  Statement,  at the time it becomes effective,  not contain any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the  statements  therein not
misleading  and (ii) in the case of the remainder of the Joint Proxy  Statement,
at the time of the mailing thereof, and at the time of the Acquiror Stockholders
Meeting,  not contain any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to state
any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not  misleading.  The  Joint  Proxy  Statement  will  comply  (with  respect  to
information  relating to Acquiror) as to form in all material  respects with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Acquiror makes no  representation  or
warranty with respect to any statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Joint Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Company.


         SECTION 4.10.  Absence of Certain Changes.

     Since December 31, 2000, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Merger  Agreement,  Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries have conducted their
business only in the ordinary  course  consistent  with past practice and, since
such date, there has not been (a) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss
(whether  or not  covered by  insurance)  affecting  the  business  or Assets of
Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate,  has
had or would be reasonably  likely to have an Acquiror  Material Adverse Effect,
(b) any change in the business, operations,  properties, condition (financial or
otherwise),  Assets or liabilities  (including,  without limitation,  contingent
liabilities) of Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary having,  individually or in
the aggregate,  an Acquiror  Material  Adverse  Effect,  (c) any action,  event,
occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that, individually or
in the  aggregate,  has had or would be  reasonably  likely to have an  Acquiror
Material  Adverse  Effect,  or (d) any  Agreement  by Acquiror  or any  Acquiror
Subsidiary  to take any of the actions  described in this Section 4.10 except as
expressly  contemplated by this Merger Agreement.  Between December 31, 2000 and
the date of this Merger Agreement,  neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary
has taken, or agreed to take, any action that would constitute a material breach
of Section 5.02 if taken after the date of this Merger Agreement.


         SECTION 4.11.  Litigation.

     As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation, arbitration
or  proceeding  pending  against,  or to the  knowledge  of Acquiror  threatened
against,  Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary or any of their respective assets
or  properties  before  any  arbitrator  or  Governmental   Entity  which  would
reasonably  be expected  to result in monetary  damages in excess of $100,000 or
any  restriction,  in any material  respect,  on the business or  operations  of
Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary.  None of the  foregoing  matters  would be
reasonably  likely to have an Acquiror  Material  Adverse  Effect.  There are no
outstanding  injunctions against Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary,  and there
are no outstanding judgments, decrees, awards or orders with respect to Acquiror
or any Acquiror  Subsidiary  which have not been  satisfied and complied with in
full or which  require  Acquiror or an Acquiror  Subsidiary  to take, or refrain
from taking, action in the future.


         SECTION 4.12.  Contracts.

     (a) As of the date hereof,  the exhibit index to  Acquiror's  most recently
filed Annual Report on Form 10-K,  as  supplemented  by Schedule  4.12(a) of the
Acquiror Disclosure  Schedule,  includes each contract (including all amendments
thereto) to which Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiaries  is a party or by which
any of them is bound and (i) which would be  required,  pursuant to the Exchange
Act and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  to be filed as an exhibit to an
Annual  Report of Acquiror on Form 10-K, a Quarterly  Report of Acquiror on Form
10-Q or a Current Report of Acquiror on Form 8-K (without regard to whether such
report is now due to be filed) or (ii)  involves  payments  by or to Acquiror or
any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  in excess of $1 million in calendar  year 2001 or any
subsequent  calendar year  (collectively,  the "Acquiror  Contracts").  Schedule
4.12(a) of the  Acquiror  Disclosure  Schedule  indicates  which of the Acquiror
Contracts have terminated,  and which of the Acquiror Contracts are scheduled to
terminate in accordance with their respective terms, in 2001.

     (b) Each Acquiror Contract is in full force and effect, constitutes a valid
and binding  obligation of and is legally  enforceable  in  accordance  with its
terms against Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary,  as applicable,  and, to the
knowledge  of  Acquiror,  (i) the  Acquiror  Contracts  are valid,  binding  and
enforceable   obligations  of  the  other  parties   thereto,   except  as  such
enforceability  may be subject  to the  effects  of any  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  fraudulent conveyance,  reorganization,  moratorium or similar Laws
affecting  creditors'  rights  generally  or subject  to the  effects of general
equitable  principles  (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(ii) Acquiror and/or each Acquiror Subsidiary,  as the case may be, has complied
with all of the  provisions  of such  Acquiror  Contracts  and is not in default
thereunder,  and there has not occurred any event which (whether with or without
notice,  lapse of time, or the happening or occurrence of any other event) would
constitute  such a  default,  and the  execution  of this  Merger  Agreement  by
Acquiror and its performance hereunder will not cause, or result in, a breach or
default under any Acquiror Contract; (iii) there has not been (A) any failure by
Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  or, to the  knowledge  of Acquiror or any
Acquiror  Subsidiary,  any other party to any such  Acquiror  Contract to comply
with all  material  provisions  thereof,  (B) any  default  by  Acquiror  or any
Acquiror Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary,
any  other  party  thereunder  or (C) to  the  knowledge  of  Acquiror  (1)  any
cancellation  thereof in writing which has not been cured or (2) any outstanding
dispute thereunder which has not been cured.

     (c)  Neither  Acquiror  nor  any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  is a  guarantor  or
otherwise liable for any liability or obligation (including Indebtedness) of any
Person other than a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror.

     (d) No officer,  director  or  significant  stockholder  of Acquiror or any
Acquiror  Subsidiary,  or affiliate  of such  officer,  director or  significant
stockholder,  is  currently  a  party  to  any  transaction,   understanding  or
commitment  with  Acquiror  or  any  Acquiror  Subsidiary,   including,  without
limitation,  any  Agreement  providing  for the  employment  of,  furnishing  of
services  by,  rental of Assets  from or to,  requiring  payments on a change of
control of  Acquiror  or  otherwise  requiring  payments  to, any such  officer,
director,  significant  stockholder  or  affiliate,  except  for the  payment of
benefits to officers or directors in the Ordinary Course of Business.

     (e) Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary is a party to any contract
with the United States government or to any other material Government Contract.


         SECTION 4.13.  Taxes.

     Except as would not be  reasonably  expected to have an  Acquiror  Material
Adverse Effect:

     (a) All Acquiror Tax Returns required to be filed with any Taxing authority
by, or with respect to, Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  have been filed
in substantial compliance with all applicable laws.

     (b) Acquiror and the Acquiror Subsidiaries have timely paid all Taxes shown
as due and payable on the  Acquiror  Tax Returns that have been so filed and all
other Taxes not subject to reporting obligations, and, as of the time of filing,
the Acquiror Tax Returns  were  complete and correct  (other than Taxes that are
being  contested in good faith and for which adequate  reserves are reflected on
the Acquiror Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP).

     (c) Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries have made adequate provision in
accordance  with GAAP for all Taxes  payable by them for which no  Acquiror  Tax
Return has yet been filed.

     (d) Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  have  complied in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes.

     (e)  Acquiror  has  not  received  written  notice  of  any  action,  suit,
proceeding,  audit or claim now  proposed or pending  against or with respect to
Acquiror  or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  in respect of any Tax that would have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

     (f) Neither  Acquiror nor any Acquiror  Subsidiary  has been a member of an
affiliated,  consolidated,  combined  or unitary  group  other than one of which
Acquiror was the common parent.

     (g) Neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  holds any asset
subject to a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code.

     (h) The federal  income Tax Returns have been examined and settled with the
IRS (or the  applicable  statute of  limitations  for the  assessment of federal
income Taxes for such periods have  expired)  for all years  through  1996.  The
parties  acknowledge that certain net operating loss carry overs generated prior
to 1997 may be unavailable in either 1997 or in subsequent years.

     (i) There are no  material  Encumbrances  for Taxes on any of the assets of
Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary.

     (j) Neither  Acquiror  nor any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  is a party to any tax
allocation,  tax sharing,  tax indemnity or similar agreement (whether or not in
writing),  arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes  (including any adverse
pricing  agreement,  closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with
any taxing authority), except among themselves.


         SECTION 4.14.  Employee Benefits.

     (a)  Schedule  4.14(a) of the  Acquiror  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a
complete and correct list identifying each material  "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section  3(3) of the ERISA,  each  employment,  severance  or similar
contract,  plan,  arrangement  or  policy  and each  other  plan or  arrangement
(written or oral) providing for  compensation,  bonuses,  profit-sharing,  stock
option or other stock  related  rights or other forms of  incentive  or deferred
compensation,  vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements),   health  or  medical  benefits,  disability  benefits,  workers'
compensation,   supplemental  unemployment  benefits,   severance  benefits  and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health,
medical  or  life  insurance  benefits)  that  is  maintained,  administered  or
contributed  to by  Acquiror  or any ERISA  Affiliate  and covers any  employee,
former employee,  officer, director or other service provider of Acquiror or any
Acquiror  Subsidiary.  Copies of such plans (and, if  applicable,  related trust
agreements) and all amendments thereto and written  interpretations thereof have
been furnished to the Company  together with the most recent annual report (Form
5500 including all applicable  schedules  thereto) and summary plan  description
prepared  in  connection  with  any  such  plan.  Such  plans  are  referred  to
collectively herein as the "Acquiror Benefit Plans."

     (b)  No  Acquiror  Benefit  Plan  constitutes  a  Multiemployer  Plan  or a
Retirement  Plan,  including any  terminated  Acquiror  Benefit  Plans.  Neither
Acquiror nor any of its ERISA  Affiliates has incurred any liability under Title
IV of ERISA  arising in  connection  with the  termination  of, or  complete  or
partial  withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously  covered by Title IV of
ERISA. Nothing has been done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding
of any asset under or in connection with any Acquiror  Benefit Plan has occurred
that will make Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary,  or any officer or director
of Acquiror or any Acquiror  Subsidiary,  subject to any liability under Title I
of ERISA or liable for any tax  pursuant to Section  4975 of the Code  (assuming
the taxable period of any such  transaction  expired as of the date hereof) that
would be reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Each  Acquiror  Benefit  Plan that is  intended to be  qualified  under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified  during the
period  from its  adoption  to date,  and each trust  forming a part  thereof is
exempt from tax pursuant to Section  501(a) of the Code.  Acquiror has furnished
to the Company copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service  determination
letters,  if any, with respect to each such Acquiror Benefit Plan. Each Acquiror
Benefit Plan has been  maintained in substantial  compliance  with its terms and
with the  requirements  prescribed  by any and all statutes,  orders,  rules and
regulations,  including  but not  limited  to  ERISA  and the  Code,  which  are
applicable to such Acquiror Benefit Plan except for any compliance failures that
are not reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) There is no contract,  agreement, plan or arrangement that, as a result
of the Merger,  would  obligate  Acquiror to make any payment of any amount that
would not be deductible  pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) or Section 280G
of the Code.

     (e) There has been no amendment to, written  interpretation or announcement
(whether or not  written)  relating to, or change in employee  participation  or
coverage  under,  any Acquiror  Benefit Plan that would  increase the expense of
maintaining  such Acquiror  Benefit Plan above the level of the expense incurred
in respect  thereof for the fiscal year ended  December  31, 2000 except for any
increase  that is not  reasonably  likely to have an Acquiror  Material  Adverse
Effect.

     (f) Neither  Acquiror nor any ERISA  Affiliate has any liability  under any
Acquiror Benefit Plan that is not a Retirement Plan that provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any  participant  or any  beneficiary  of a participant
after such participant's termination of employment, except as may be required by
Section  4980B of the Code or  Section  601 (et  seq.) of  ERISA,  or under  any
applicable  state law, and at the expense of the  participant or the beneficiary
of the participant. No Acquiror Benefit Plan is a VEBA or an ESOP.

     (g) Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries have not received notice of any
pending unfair labor practice charges,  contract grievances under any collective
bargaining  agreement,  other  administrative  charges,  claims,  grievances  or
lawsuits  before any court,  governmental  agency,  regulatory  body, or arbiter
arising under any Law governing  any Acquiror  Benefit Plan,  and, to Acquiror's
knowledge, there exist no facts that could give rise to such a claim.

     (h) There are no  arrangements,  agreements or plans pursuant to which cash
and non-cash  payments  will become  payable to any current or former  employee,
officer or director of Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  as a result of the
Merger or a termination of service subsequent to the consummation of the Merger.
There  is  no  Acquiror  Benefit  Plan  requiring   payments,   cancellation  of
Indebtedness or other  obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise
as a result of the consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Merger  Agreement or as a result of a termination  of service  subsequent to the
consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this Merger  Agreement,
with respect to any current or former employee,  officer or director of Acquiror
or any Acquiror Subsidiary.


         SECTION 4.15.Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and Registrations.

     (a) Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary is in violation of, or has
violated,   any  applicable  provisions  of  any  laws,  statutes,   ordinances,
regulations,  judgments,  injunctions, orders or consent decrees, except for any
such violations that, individually or in the aggregate,  would not be reasonably
likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  Each  of  Acquiror  and the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries  has all  permits,
licenses,  approvals,  authorizations  of and  registrations  with and under all
federal,  state,  local and foreign  laws,  and from all  Governmental  Entities
required by Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries to carry on their respective
businesses  as  currently  conducted,  except where the failure to have any such
permits, licenses, approvals,  authorizations or registrations,  individually or
in the aggregate,  would not be reasonably  likely to have an Acquiror  Material
Adverse Effect.

     (c) Schedule 4.15 of the Acquiror  Disclosure  Schedule contains a true and
complete  list of all  material  licenses,  permits,  and  authorizations  ("FCC
Licenses")  issued  to  Acquiror  or  the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries  by  the  FCC,
including,  with respect to Licenses  held by Motient  Services Inc.  only,  the
frequencies  authorized for and the issuance and  expiration  dates of each such
FCC  License.  No such FCC License is subject to any  restriction  or  condition
which would limit in any material  respect the full operation of the business of
Acquiror and the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries  as now  operated,  and no  proceeding,
inquiry,  investigation  or  other  administrative  action  is  pending  or,  to
Acquiror's  knowledge,  threatened by or before the FCC that would reasonably be
expected  to result in the  revocation  of any  material  FCC  authorization  or
otherwise  impair in any material  respect the full operation of the business of
Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries.  The representations  contained in this
Section  4.15(c) and (d) are limited by the  statements set forth in the section
of Acquiror's most recent SEC Form 10-K entitled  "Business - Regulation"  filed
with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  on April 2,  2001  ("Regulatory
Disclosure").  The statements  contained in the Regulatory  Disclosure fully and
accurately  describe,   with  respect  to  the  business  of  Acquiror  and  its
Subsidiaries,  the material  legal  matters and  proceedings  arising  under the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the published rules, regulations and
policies promulgated thereunder by the FCC.

     (d) The FCC Licenses are in good standing,  are in full force and effect in
all material respects and are not materially  impaired by any act or omission of
Acquiror, the Acquiror  Subsidiaries,  or any of their officers,  directors,  or
employees. All material reports, forms, and statements required to be filed with
the FCC with respect to the  business of Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries
have been filed and are complete and accurate in all material respects.


         SECTION 4.16.  Title to Properties.

     (a) Acquiror and each Acquiror  Subsidiary  have good and marketable  title
to, or valid leasehold  interests in, all their properties and assets except for
such as are no longer  used or useful in the conduct of their  businesses  or as
have been disposed of in the Ordinary  Course of Business and except for defects
in title,  easements,  restrictive covenants and similar Liens,  encumbrances or
impediments that, in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the ability
of Acquiror and the Acquiror Subsidiaries to conduct their business,  taken as a
whole, as currently conducted. All such assets and properties, other than assets
and  properties  in which  Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  has  leasehold
interests, are free and clear of all Liens.

     (b) Acquiror and each Acquiror  Subsidiary are in compliance with the terms
of all leases to which they are a party and under  which they are in  occupancy,
and all such leases are in full force and effect and Acquiror and each  Acquiror
Subsidiary enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases.


         SECTION 4.17.  Intellectual Property.

     (a) "Acquiror  Intellectual Property" means Intellectual Property necessary
or useful to carry on the business of Acquiror  and the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole,  as  currently  conducted.  Schedule  4.17(a) of the  Acquiror
Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a complete  and  correct  list of the  Acquiror
Intellectual  Property  which is not readily  obtainable  on the open market for
such Intellectual  Property at market prices and is materially necessary for the
operation of Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  in the Ordinary  Course of
Business.

     (b) Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries have good and valid title to or
have a valid and enforceable license to use the Acquiror  Intellectual  Property
free and clear of all Encumbrances.

     (c) The operation of the business of Acquiror and each Acquiror  Subsidiary
as  currently  conducted  does not, and will not,  infringe on any  Intellectual
Property rights of others,  violate any right of any Person (including any right
to privacy or publicity),  or constitute  unfair  competition or trade practices
under the laws of any jurisdiction in any material respect. Neither Acquiror nor
any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  has  received  any  written  notice of  infringement,
misappropriation,  or  violation  of or  challenge  to,  and there are no claims
pending or, to Acquiror's  knowledge,  threatened  with respect to the rights of
others to the use of, any Acquiror Intellectual Property that, in any such case,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect.  The Acquiror  Intellectual  Property is not subject to
any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge.

     (d) To the best of Acquiror's knowledge,  no third party is infringing upon
any of the  Acquiror  Intellectual  Property,  and Acquiror has not notified any
third party that it believes such third party is interfering  with,  infringing,
or misappropriating any of the Acquiror Intellectual Property or engaging in any
act of unfair  competition.  Acquiror  has the right to bring an action  for the
infringement of all of the Acquiror Intellectual Property.

     (e) All necessary registration, maintenance, and renewal fees in connection
with Acquiror  Intellectual Property that is registered and owned by Acquiror or
any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  have been  filed  with  relevant  patent,  copyright,
trademark or other  authorities  in the United  States and any other country for
the purposes of maintaining such Acquiror  Intellectual  Property.  In each case
where Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary has acquired any Intellectual Property
from any person,  Acquiror or the Acquiror  Subsidiary  has obtained a valid and
enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights acquired in
such Intellectual Property to Acquiror or Acquiror Subsidiary, as applicable.

     (f)  Acquiror  and each  Acquiror  Subsidiary  have taken all  commercially
reasonable  steps  that are  required  to  protect  Acquiror  and each  Acquiror
Subsidiary's  rights in  confidential  information and trade secrets of Acquiror
and each Acquiror  Subsidiary or provided by any other Person to Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary.  Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror and each Acquiror
Subsidiary  have  and  enforce  a  policy  requiring  each  employee,  director,
consultant  and  contractor  to  execute a  confidentiality  and  non-disclosure
agreement substantially in the form previously provided to the Company, and each
present and former  employee,  director,  consultant and contractor has executed
such an agreement.

     (g) Neither this Merger Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Merger  Agreement  will result in (i)  Acquiror  granting to any third party any
right to any  Intellectual  Property  right owned by, or licensed to,  Acquiror,
(ii)  Acquiror  being  bound  by,  or  subject  to,  any  non-compete  or  other
restriction on the operation or scope of Acquiror's business,  or (iii) Acquiror
being  obligated  to pay any  royalties  or other  amounts to any third party in
excess of those payable by Acquiror prior to the Closing.  Neither  Acquiror nor
any Acquiror  Subsidiary  will be, as a result of the  execution and delivery of
this Merger Agreement or the performance of its obligations hereunder, in breach
of  any  license,  sublicense  or  other  Agreement  relating  to  the  Acquiror
Intellectual Property.

     (h) Schedule 4.17(h) of the Acquiror  Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all material  contracts,  licenses,  and Agreements  relating to the Acquiror
Intellectual  Property  which is not readily  obtainable  on the open market for
such Intellectual  Property at market prices and is materially necessary for the
operation of Acquiror and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  in the Ordinary  Course of
Business to which  Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  is a party or to which
Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary is bound.  Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror
Subsidiary  is in breach and neither  Acquiror nor any Acquiror  Subsidiary  has
failed to perform under any of the foregoing  contracts,  licenses or Agreements
and, to Acquiror's knowledge,  no other party to any such contract,  license, or
Agreement  is in breach  thereof  or has failed to perform  thereunder  and,  to
Acquiror's  knowledge,  there are not threatened  disputes or disagreements with
respect to such contracts,  licenses, or Agreements.  No person who has licensed
Intellectual  Property to  Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary  has  ownership
rights or  license  rights to  improvements  made by  Acquiror  or any  Acquiror
Subsidiary in such Intellectual Property.

     (i) No person  other than  Acquiror or the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries  has any
right  or  interest  of an  kind  or  nature  in or  with  respect  to  Acquiror
Intellectual  Property that is owned by Acquiror or the Acquiror Subsidiaries or
any portion  thereof or any rights to sell,  license,  lease,  transfer,  use or
otherwise exploit such Acquiror Intellectual Property or any portion thereof.

     (j)  Schedule  4.17(j) of the  Acquiror  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a
complete and correct list of (i) all Persons other than Acquiror or the Acquiror
Subsidiaries  who have been provided with source code or have claimed a right to
be provided with any source code for any Acquiror  Intellectual Property that is
owned by Acquiror or the Acquiror Subsidiaries which is not readily available on
the open market at market prices and is  materially  necessary for the operation
of Acquiror and the  Acquiror  Subsidiaries  in the Ordinary  Course of Business
(the  "Acquiror  Owned  Software"),  and (ii) all source code escrow  agreements
relating to any of the Acquiror  Owned  Software.  No Person other than Acquiror
and the Acquiror  Subsidiaries is in possession of, or has or has had access to,

ownership,  operation,  or  tenancy  of such  real  property.  Neither  PCBs nor
asbestos-containing materials are present on or in the Acquiror Real Property or
the improvements  thereon.  There has been no Release of Hazardous Materials at,
on,  under,  or from the real  property  currently  owned,  used or  operated by
Acquiror or any  Acquiror  Subsidiary,  nor was there such a Release at any real

for Remediation with respect to such Hazardous Materials.

     (e)  Acquiror  has  furnished  to the Company  copies of all  environmental
assessments,  reports, audits and other documents in its possession or under its
control that relate to the Acquiror Real  Property,  or Acquiror or any Acquiror

concerning the  environmental  conditions of the Acquiror Real  Property,  prior
uses of the  Acquiror  Real  Property,  and the  operations  of  Acquiror or the
Acquiror  Subsidiaries related to compliance with Environmental Laws is accurate
and complete.

any  Environmental  Claim has been filed or has  attached to the  Acquiror  Real
Property.

     (e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in subsections (a),
(b), (c) and (d) above or elsewhere in this Merger Agreement,  nothing contained
in this Merger  Agreement shall prohibit (i) either Acquiror or the Company from
complying  with Rules  14d-9 and 14e-2  promulgated  under the  Exchange  Act or
publicly  disclosing  the existence of any Competing  Transaction as required by
applicable Law, or (ii) the  Representatives  of either Acquiror or the Company,
as the case may be,  prior to the time of the Acquiror  Stockholders  Meeting or
the Company Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, furnishing information to,
or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in connection with
an  unsolicited  bona fide  written  proposal  from such  Person for a Competing
Transaction  for Acquiror or the Company,  as the case may be, which  involves a
merger,  consolidation,  share exchange, business combination or the acquisition
of more than 75% of the outstanding common stock of Acquiror or the Company,  as
the case may be, if before doing so: (A)  Acquiror or the  Company,  as the case
may be, enters into with such Person a  confidentiality  agreement in reasonably
customary  form on terms  not  more  favorable  to such  Person  than the  terms
contained  in the  Confidentiality  Agreement;  (B) the  Board of  Directors  of
Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, after consultation with independent
financial  advisors,  reasonably  determines  in good faith  that the  Competing
Transaction,  if  consummated,  is reasonably  likely to result in a transaction
more favorable to the Acquiror Stockholders or the Company Stockholders,  as the
case may be,  than the Merger  (any such more  favorable  Competing  Transaction
being referred to in this Merger  Agreement as a "Superior  Proposal");  (C) the
Board of Directors of Acquiror or the  Company,  as the case may be,  reasonably
determines  in its good faith  judgment,  after  consultation  with  independent
financial  advisors,  that such Person has the  financial  ability to consummate
such  proposal;  (D) the Board of Directors  of Acquiror or the Company,  as the
case  may be,  after  consultation  with  and  having  received  the  advice  of
independent  legal  counsel,  determines  in good  faith  that  such  action  is
necessary for such Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Acquiror  Stockholders  or the Company  Stockholders,  as the case may be, under
applicable Law; and (E) Acquiror or the Company,  as the case may be, shall have
otherwise complied with the terms of this Section 5.05.

     (f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in subsections (a),
(b), (c), (d) and (e) above or elsewhere in this Merger Agreement,  in the event
that a proposal for a Competing  Transaction  constitutes  a Superior  Proposal,
nothing contained in this Merger Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of  Acquiror  or  the  Company,  as  the  case  may  be,  from  withdrawing  its
recommendation  required  under Section  6.02(a) and Section  6.02(b) hereof and
recommending such Superior Proposal to its respective stockholders:  (i) if, but
only if,  Acquiror or the Company,  as the case may be: (A) complies  fully with
this  Section  5.05 and (B)  provides  the other  parties with at least four (4)
business  days prior  written  notice of its intent to withdraw  its  respective
recommendation and (ii) if, in the event that during such four (4) business days
Acquiror or the Company,  as the case may be,  makes a counter  proposal to such
Superior  Proposal (any such counter  proposal  being referred to in this Merger
Agreement as the "Counter Proposal"),  the Board of Directors of Acquiror or the
Company,  a case may be, in good faith,  taking  into  account the advice of its
outside  financial  advisors,  determines  that such Counter  Proposal is not at
least as favorable to its stockholders as the Superior Proposal.

     (g) In  the  event  that,  pursuant  to  Section  5.05(e)  of  this  Merger
Agreement, either party elects to engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish any information to, any Person regarding a Superior Proposal, such party
must at least two (2)  business  days prior to engaging in such  discussions  or
negotiations or furnishing such information  provide written notice to the other
party.

     (h) Nothing in this Section 5.05 shall (i) permit either party to terminate
this Merger Agreement  (except as specifically  provided in Article VIII hereof)
or (ii) affect any other obligation of such party under this Merger Agreement.


         SECTION 5.06.  Exchange Rights.

     Until the  termination of this Merger  Agreement  pursuant to Article VIII,
the Company shall not, prior to date that is 5 months after Initial Closing Date
(as  defined  in the Bridge  Note  Agreement)  for the Notes (as  defined in the
Bridge Note Agreement) issued pursuant to the Bridge Note Agreement exercise any
rights  which the Company may have under the Bridge Note  Agreement  to exchange
the Notes for XM Shares (as defined therein) unless Acquiror materially breaches
this Merger  Agreement  or  Acquiror  elects to prepay all or any portion of any
Notes in accordance with Section 2.06 thereof, in which case such exchange right
shall be exercisable at any time following the giving of an optional  prepayment
notice  in  accordance  with  Section  2.06  thereof  and  prior to the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the prepayment date.


         Section 5.07.  Employee Benefits.

     (a)  Following  the  Effective  Time,  Acquiror  shall provide to the those
individuals  who  were  employees  of the  Company  or  any of its  subsidiaries
immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time  ("Employees")  employee  plans  and
programs which provide benefits taken as a whole that are no less favorable than
either  (i)  those  provided  to  those  individuals  immediately  prior  to the
Effective  Time or (ii) those provided to comparable  employees of Acquiror,  as
Acquiror  may elect and shall take such  actions as are  necessary  to allow the
Company's employees to participate in Acquiror's 401(k); provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 5.07(a) shall require  Acquiror to provide benefits on a
change of control,  options or other incentives  comparable to those provided by
the Company. With respect to such benefits,  service accrued by Employees during
employment with the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time shall be  recognized  for all purposes as service  rendered to Acquiror and
the Acquiror  Subsidiaries  and  successors,  except to the extent  necessary to
prevent duplication of benefits.

     (b) Acquiror shall honor,  in accordance  with their terms,  and shall make
required  payments when due under, all Company Benefit Plans, as in effect as of
the date hereof and as are amended without  violation of this Merger  Agreement;
provided,  however, that the foregoing shall not preclude Acquiror from amending
or terminating any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

     (c) With respect to any welfare  plans in which the  Employees are eligible
to  participate  after  the  Effective  Time,   Acquiror  shall  (i)  waive  all
limitations as to preexisting  conditions,  exclusions and waiting  periods with
respect to participation and coverage  requirements  applicable to the Employees
and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any  co-payments  and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective  Time in  satisfying  any  applicable  deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements.

     (d) Acquiror hereby  acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Merger Agreement shall cause a "change of control" to occur
under the  agreements  set forth on Schedule  5.07(d) of the Company  Disclosure
Schedule.  Acquiror  hereby agrees to honor the terms of such agreements as such
terms are set forth on  Schedule  5.07(d) of the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule,
subject to  amendments  to such  agreements  as may be  mutually  agreed upon by
Acquiror and the individual that is a party to each such agreement.


         Section 5.08.  Covenants Relating to XM.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Merger Agreement
or the Bridge Note Documents,  Acquiror  hereby  covenants and agrees that, from
the date of this Merger Agreement until the Effective Time,  except as expressly
provided  in this  Merger  Agreement  or in the Bridge  Note  Documents,  unless
consented  to in writing  by each of the  Preferred  Stockholders  in their sole
discretion, Acquiror shall not, and shall not permit any Acquiror Subsidiary to:

     (a) (i) permit  any  Encumbrances  (other  than those in effect on the date
hereof and which are  disclosed  on  Schedule  4.26 of the  Acquiror  Disclosure
Schedule)  whatsoever  in respect of any  Acquiror  XM Stock,  (ii)  subject any
Acquiror  XM  Stock  to any  limitations  or  restrictions,  including,  without
limitation, in respect of the right to lease, lend, exchange,  mortgage, pledge,
convert, register,  transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Acquiror XM Stock
or grant any option,  right or interest  therein (and any other  securities into
which such  Acquiror XM Stock is  convertible)  and the proceeds  thereof or the
right to acquire any such  option,  right or interest,  (iii) sell,  transfer or
assign any  Acquiror  XM Stock,  or grant or create any other  option,  right or
interest  in any  Acquiror  XM Stock (and any other  securities  into which such
Acquiror  XM Stock is  convertible)  and the  proceeds  thereof  or the right to
acquire  any such  option,  right or  interest,  and (iv)  enter  into any swap,
participation  or other  arrangement  that transfers to another,  in whole or in
part, any of the economic  consequences of ownership of any Acquiror XM Stock or
grant any option, right or interest therein (and any other securities into which
such Acquiror XM Stock is convertible)  and the proceeds thereof or the right to
acquire any such option, right or interest,  in each such case, whether any such
transaction  described  in clauses  (i)  through  (iv) above is to be settled by
delivery of capital  stock,  such other  securities,  other  rights,  in cash or
otherwise;

     (b) (i) exercise voting or other control rights, powers and privileges with
respect to any Acquiror XM Stock or any XM Stock  Documents,  (ii) consent to or
approve  (or  withhold  any such  consent  or  approval)  of (A) the  amendment,
alteration,  supplement,  repeal or any other  modification  of any  Acquiror XM
Stock or any XM Stock  Documents,  (B) any action to be taken with  respect,  or
pursuant, to any Acquiror XM Stock or any XM Stock Documents,  or (iii) waive or
otherwise not exercise any right, remedy, power,  privilege or obligation under,
or with respect to, any Acquiror XM Stock or any XM Stock Documents, in the case
of each of (i),  (ii) and  (iii),  to the  extent  that it could  reasonably  be
expected  to render  the  conditions  to  closing  in  Section  7.04(c)  and (d)
incapable of satisfaction; and

     (c) authorize, or commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

     For the benefit of the Preferred  Stockholders,  for so long as this Merger

the beneficial  owner of, or acquire any voting or other rights with respect to,
any Acquiror XM Stock  pursuant to the Bridge Note Documents or any of the other
documents and  instruments  delivered in connection  therewith,  it shall comply
with the  provisions of this Section 5.08 as if it were Acquiror  without giving
effect to any exceptions  applicable to Acquiror with respect to the Bridge Note
Documents.


         SECTION 5.09.  Merger Sub Compliance.

     Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of its obligations under
or related to this Agreement.

hereto  agree to  cooperate  in good faith  with each  other and to modify  this
Merger  Agreement and the Restated Charter and to execute and deliver such other
documents  or  instruments  as either  party  reasonably  requests to the extent
reasonably  necessary to satisfy initial listing  requirements  for the Acquiror

of the Notice of  Purchase,  contained in this Merger  Agreement  except for any
failure of a  representation  or warranty to be true and correct (without regard

Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if the Acquiror is aware of one or more

         SECTION 8.04.  Amendment.

     This  Merger  Agreement  may be amended by the  parties  hereto at any time
prior  to the  Effective  Time;  provided,  however,  that,  after  the  Company

no amendment may be made which would require such approval under  applicable Law
without stockholder approval;  provided, further, however, that unless consented
to in writing by the  Preferred  Stockholders  (such  consent to be given at the
sole  discretion  of the  Preferred  Stockholders),  no amendment to this Merger
Agreement  (together  with  the  Exhibits,  Schedules,  the  Company  Disclosure

and the other Documents  delivered  pursuant  hereto) or any provision hereof or
thereof shall be made if such amendment would be reasonably  likely to adversely
affect  the  rights,   remedies  or  overall   economics  of  the   transactions
contemplated herein of either Hughes or Acquiror. For the avoidance of doubt, no

Document  delivered  pursuant  hereto and (c)  subject to the proviso of Section
8.04,  waive  compliance  with any of the  agreements  or  conditions  contained
herein; provided,  however, that unless consented to in writing by the Preferred
Stockholders  (such consent to be given at the sole  discretion of the Preferred
Stockholders),  no extension or waiver of this Merger  Agreement  (together with
the  Exhibits,  Schedules,  the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  and the  Acquiror
Disclosure  Schedule and the other Documents  delivered  pursuant hereto) or any
provision  hereof or thereof shall be made if such  extension or waiver would be
reasonably  likely to adversely  affect the rights or remedies of the  Preferred
Stockholders; provided, further, however, that unless consented to in writing by
Hughes (such consent to be given at the sole discretion of Hughes), no extension
or waiver of this Merger Agreement (together with the Exhibits,  Schedules,  the
Company Disclosure  Schedule and the Acquiror  Disclosure Schedule and the other
Documents delivered pursuant hereto) or any provision hereof or thereof shall be
made if such extension or waiver would be reasonably  likely to adversely affect
the  rights,  remedies or overall  economics  of the  transactions  contemplated
herein of either  Hughes or  Acquiror . Any such  extension  or waiver  shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to
be bound  thereby.  The  failure of any party to assert any of its rights  under
this Merger Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                      (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as of
                                      September 30, 2001 and (y) the number of

                                      exceeds the value of such XM Merger Shares
                                      at the Merger Closing Date as determined
                                      pursuant to the Merger Agreement at the

                                      then the aggregate outstanding principal
                                      amount of all of the Notes shall be
                                      reduced, on a pro rata basis according to
                                      the aggregate outstanding principal amount
                                      of each Note, by an amount equal to (a)
                                      the Revised XM Value minus (b) the Initial
                                      XM Value; provided that in no case shall
                                      the outstanding principal amount of any
                                      Note be reduced to a number less than
                                      zero. If the Revised XM Value does not
                                      exceed the Initial XM Value, then there
                                      shall be no adjustment to the outstanding
                                      principal amount of any Note. If no
                                      Discrepancy Notes were issued on the
                                      Merger Closing Date, there shall be no
                                      adjustment to the Preferred Stockholder
                                      Merger Consideration. If the Discrepancy
                                      Notes are adjusted so that the aggregate
                                      principal amount thereof is reduced to
                                      zero, the Discrepancy Notes shall be
                                      cancelled and upon payment of all other
                                      amounts payable or owing under the
                                      Discrepancy Note Documents, all such
                                      Discrepancy Note Documents shall be
                                      terminated.
