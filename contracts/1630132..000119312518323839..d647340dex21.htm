so surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.02</U>, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this <U>Article</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;II</U>. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry

Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than

required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and each covenants that none of the information supplied or to be

comments made by Parent and its counsel. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders&#146; Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or
