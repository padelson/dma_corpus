ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.

SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01,_ subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and pursuant to the DGCL, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will take place (a) at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of

the third (3 _rd_ ) Business Day after the later to be satisfied of the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)_
(subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other
conditions to Closing set forth in  _Article_ __ _ VII_, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver), or (b) at
such other place, at such time or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree in writing; _provided_ , that if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Article_ __ _
VII_ (except for any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing
or waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions), the Closing shall
occur on the date that is the earlier to occur of (x) a date during the
Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to the Company, and (y) the third (3 _rd_ ) Business
Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (in each case, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_
on such date (except for any conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions
at the Closing or waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions));
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the date on which the Closing is required
to occur under this _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ is any day other than Monday, then
the Closing shall take place on the first Monday that is a Business Day
following such date and _provided still further_ , that in no event shall
such Closing occur earlier than January 7, 2019. The date on which the Closing
occurs shall be referred to as the " _Closing Date_." For the avoidance of
doubt, for accounting purposes, the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred
at 12:01 a.m., New York time, on the Closing Date.

SECTION 1.03  _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree to in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other date and
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective
Time_."

SECTION 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. As a result of the Merger, (a)
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ "), and (b) the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and

obligations, restrictions, disabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities, and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



2

    

SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Company_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Company as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ") shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and, in
each case, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_).

 

SECTION 1.06 _Directors and Officers_ _of the Surviving Company_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Company and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Company, in each case until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Company.

 

SECTION 1.07 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers
and directors of the Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other
actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of_ _Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities, or any other Person:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and any
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
$16.10 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") and, upon
conversion thereof in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_,
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. The Merger
Consideration is payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time.

 



3

    

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of_ _Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of effecting payments to the holders
of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, and (ii) enter into a
paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , ___however_
, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination
of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Company. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause to be mailed
to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying Agent),
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates
evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto (and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
the Certificate representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this _Article_ __
_ II_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article_ __ _ II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required
to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_. In lieu thereof, each registered
holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.

 



4

    

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article_
__ _ II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for,
and Parent and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond in form and substance
and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company, the Paying
Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and
Parent (and any Affiliate thereof or any other withholding agent) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options or
Restricted Stock Units, such amounts as is required to deduct and withhold

Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day of

Option, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise
price per Share of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. All such payments
shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_. Each Company Stock Option that has an exercise
price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of any

interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit. All such
payments shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Shares or
other equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in

as amended.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall provide any
notice required under the Company Stock Plan, obtain any necessary consents,
adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Stock Plan or any
outstanding awards and take all other actions required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, so long as such
actions do not create any liabilities or obligations not currently existing
under the current Company Stock Plan or otherwise created pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of, and a
reasonable opportunity to review and consult on all resolutions and other
written actions as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

SECTION 2.05 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.06 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares will no longer be
outstanding and automatically will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and,
except as otherwise provided by applicable Laws, each holder of Dissenting
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares,
other than such rights as are granted under such Section 262\. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Shares in the manner provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_.

written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for

default, breach or violation of, any Company Permit to which such entity is a
party or by which such entity or any property or asset of such entity is
bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that

conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligations of the Lenders
to fund the Debt Financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter or to the obligations of the Equity Investors to fund the full amount

Letters. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_, Parent and Merger Sub do not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing

similar premiums and charges under the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter
and including after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex, including
original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter)
shall provide Merger Sub with cash proceeds at the Effective Time sufficient,

Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to (x) constitute
a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters, (y) result in a failure of any condition
of the Commitment Letters, or (z) result in any portion of the Financing being
unavailable in an amount equal to the Required Amount at the Effective Time.
Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the
assumptions, or the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub, in
any of the Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect. Parent or
Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the
date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters
have been modified, amended or altered, and none of the commitments under any
of the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn, terminated, amended, modified
or rescinded in any respect. Except for the Commitment Letters delivered in
the form pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.09(a)_,

impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing, there are no side
letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party related to the Financing
that could affect the availability of the Financing in any respect.

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing

to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 

SECTION 4.10 _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the Transactions (including the payment of the Merger
Consideration, any other payments in respect of prepayment, repayment,

such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such person

the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature.

 

SECTION 4.11 _Limited Guarantee_ _s_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company the limited
guarantees addressed to the Company from certain of the Sponsors (the "
_Limited Guarantees_ "). The Limited Guarantees are valid and in full force
and effect and constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Sponsors,
enforceable in accordance with their terms. No event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the
part of the Sponsors under the Limited Guarantees.

 

SECTION 4.12 _Non-Reliance on Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company and Company Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger

Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective stockholders or
Representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto except to the
extent such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information and business plans otherwise result in a breach or violation of
_Article_ __ _ III_. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that, except
for the representations and warranties set forth in _Article_ __ _
III_, none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any of their
respective stockholders or Representatives, nor any other person, has made or
is making any warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts,
forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of
the

 



25

    

 assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans), and Parent and Merger Sub have not
relied on any such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans) received from the Company and Company Subsidiaries and
their Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub entered into this Agreement based
upon their own investigation, examination and determination with respect

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

SECTION 6.01 _Proxy Statement_ _; Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company, in consultation with
Parent as set forth herein, shall prepare and file with the SEC the
preliminary Proxy Statement, and the parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the preliminary Proxy Statement to be so
prepared and filed within twenty (20) Business Days following the date hereof.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.03_), the
Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is
customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and each covenants
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion
or incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the
SEC or first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and each of the Company
and Parent shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior
to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating to holders of Shares
and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests
for additional information. The Company shall consider in good faith
any comments made by Parent and its counsel. If, at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01_, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed
or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, and such notice shall
be sent to the Companys stockholders not more than five (5) Business Days
after such SEC clearance. The Company shall call the Company Stockholders
Meeting for a date not later than twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer
time frame as may be required by applicable Law) after it gives notice of the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on a date for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a
quorum and to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum
is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall, unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change (to the
extent permitted under _Section_ __ _ 6.03_), use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Without the
prior 

 



29

    

 written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than
procedural matters including stockholder approval of golden parachute
compensation) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the
Companys obligations to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_
shall not be limited by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission of any Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal, or by any Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Except (i) as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any
Contract entered into prior to the date hereof, or (ii) as would be
reasonably expected to violate or result in the loss of any attorney-client
(or other legal) privilege, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
(and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to), at Parents expense: (x)
provide to Parent and to its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to
the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof,
and (y) furnish as promptly as practicable to Parent such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request.

 

(b) All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or its or their
Representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated June 27,
2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Durational Capital
Partners, LLC and the Company.

 

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION 6.03 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall
cause its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or negotiations that
may be ongoing with a potential acquiror with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, and shall request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith
and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such person or its Representatives. Except as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall not modify, amend, terminate, waive, release, or fail to enforce any
provisions of, any "standstill" provisions (including provisions that
restrict or prohibit the purchase of Shares or the making or soliciting of any
offer or proposal) of any Contract to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees that it shall promptly inform its Representatives (that could
reasonably be expected to take any of the actions set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 6.03(a)_) of the obligations undertaken in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_.
Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_, the Company Board shall not
approve any business combination or transaction which would result in a
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder for purposes of Section 203 of
the DGCL (other than the Voting Agreement).

(b) Except as permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, during the Pre-
Closing Period, the Company agrees that neither it nor any Company Subsidiary
shall, and it shall cause its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives
not to (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) engage
in, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal except to notify such person of
the existence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_;  _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (but only upon the express
written request of the counterparty) grant a waiver, amendment or release
under any "standstill" provisions (including provisions that restrict or
prohibit the purchase of Shares or the making or soliciting of any offer or
proposal) of any Contract only to the extent necessary to

 



30

    

 allow a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the
Company Board so long as (x) the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company promptly
notifies Parent of any such waiver, amendment, or release. The foregoing
notwithstanding, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
have no right to, prevent the Company or the Company Board from furnishing
information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, any person in
connection with an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by such person that did
not result from a Willful and Material Breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_,
if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (1) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected
to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
and (B) the Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Company with
regard to confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement and which does
not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would restrict the
Companys ability to comply with its disclosure obligations to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.03(d)_ and _Section_
__ _ 6.03(e)_) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours) (i) provide Parent notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, (B) any written requests, inquiries, proposals or offers received,
or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated, with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) any inquiry, offer or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to result in any Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer
(including copies of any material written inquiries, proposals or offers,
including proposed agreements), and the identity of the person or "group"
making such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, to the
extent disclosure of such identity is not restricted by the terms of any
Contract in effect as of the date hereof, provided that Parent shall keep
confidential and not disclose the identity of such person or "group" except to
the extent required by Law, and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
due diligence materials concerning the Company provided by the Company to
such party to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent.
The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) of the status and details (including
material amendments or modifications to the terms or conditions and copies of
any proposed agreements) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry,
proposal or offer concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours), following
a determination by the Company Board in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)_ that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of
such determination.

(d) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall not, and shall not publicly propose to: (i)
withhold, withdraw or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
declare the advisability of, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (v) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a
tender offer or exchange offer that is subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer, or (vi) if an Acquisition Proposal (including
a material amendment to the terms of an existing Acquisition Proposal, other
than as contemplated by the foregoing _clause (v)_ ) shall have been publicly
announced or disclosed, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon
the written request of Parent within five (5) Business Days after such written
request; _provided_ , that Parent may make such request only once with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently materially modified, in which case, Parent may make such request
once each time such material modification is made (any of the foregoing
actions in _clauses (i)_ to _(vi)_ , an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

 



31

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may take any
action that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change (x) if the Company
receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a Willful and Material Breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ and the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that such unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
or (y) if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that an Intervening Event has occurred, and as a
result thereof, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take an action that
constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that:

 

(i) prior to taking any action that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(g)_,
(A) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it intends to take an
action that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement (in order to enter into an acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal) pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(g)_, (B) the Company shall have provided Parent a written
summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the person or
"group" making the Superior Proposal) and an unredacted copy of any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement or commitment in respect of
such Superior Proposal (whether in draft form or otherwise) in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal, (C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of
four (4) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall
have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent
and Parents Representatives, any _bona fide_ proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (D) no earlier than the end of
such four (4)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors), after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement committed to by Parent in writing during such
four (4)-Business Day period, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the
subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided
above, but any such subsequent references herein to a "four (4)- Business Day
period" shall be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period"); and

(ii) prior to taking any action that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to an Intervening Event, (A) the Company shall notify
Parent in writing that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation
Change and the material facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event, (B) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4)-Business
Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall discuss and
negotiate in good faith, and shall make its Representatives available to
discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parents Representatives
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
(C) no earlier than the end of such four (4)-Business Day period and prior to
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall determine
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement committed to by Parent in writing during such
four (4)-Business Day period, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
material development in an Intervening Event that was previously the subject
of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above,
but any such subsequent references herein to a "four (4)-Business Day period"
shall be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period").

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
or otherwise complying

 



32

    

 with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement
that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed, in and
of itself, an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_ with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ proposal or offer
(including any proposal from or to the Companys stockholders) from any third
party acting independently of the Company other than Parent or Merger Sub
relating to (1) any direct or indirect acquisition of (A) more than 15% of the
assets, revenue or net income of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value thereof),
including an acquisition of 15% or more of such consolidated assets, revenue
or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries indirectly through the
acquisition of equity interests of any Company Subsidiaries, or (B) more than
15% of any class of voting equity securities of the Company, (2) any tender
offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of
any class of voting equity securities of the Company, or (3) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company (other than
any such transaction among the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries or
among the Company Subsidiaries).

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition Proposal)
occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that was not known or
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
(or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known
or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement), other than (1) any change, effect, event, occurrence or fact
resulting from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company, (2)
the receipt, existence or terms of an actual or possible Acquisition Proposal
and (3) any change, in and of itself, in the price or trading volume of the
Shares (it being understood that the underlying facts giving rise or
contributing to such change may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been an Intervening Event, to the extent otherwise permitted by this
definition).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal (as defined above, except that all references to "15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" will be deemed references to "more than
50%") that (1) is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel and after taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, including the identity and nature of the person making
the offer), (2) is reasonably capable of being timely financed and
consummated in accordance with its terms, and (3) if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the Merger and the Transactions (taking into
account any proposed amendment or modification committed to by Parent in
writing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)(i)_).

 

SECTION 6.04 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements (in the case of any such agreements entered into in
contemplation of this Agreement, disclosed to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement) between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any of their
respective present or former directors and officers (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable
with

 



33

    

 respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the Company
Charter or the Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except to the
extent required by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. To the fullest
extent permitted by Law, Parent and the Surviving Company shall, jointly and
severally, pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined in accordance with applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the
event of any such Action, (i) Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company,
promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is
a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; _provided_ , __ that, in the event that any claim
for indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_ shall be in addition to any rights such person may
have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain "tail" insurance
policies with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective
Time on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for the six
(6)-year period following the Effective Time at a price not to exceed 300% of
the amount per annum the Company paid for such insurance in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company does not
obtain "tail" insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the
Effective Time, or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time, if available, the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the Surviving
Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , ___however_ , that
in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of
current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ ,
___further_ , that in the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation
of such current policies, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be required to
obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies
for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its 

 



34

    

 assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 6.04_.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of
the obligations of the Surviving Company under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

(f) With respect to any indemnification obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_, Parent hereby
acknowledges and agrees (i) that it and the Surviving Company shall be the
indemnitors of first resort with respect to all indemnification obligations
of the Parent and/or the Surviving Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.04_ (i.e., their obligations to an applicable Indemnified Party are primary
and any obligation of any other person to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification and/or insurance for the same expenses or losses incurred by
such Indemnified Parties are secondary), and (ii) that it irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases any such other person from any and all claims for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof.

SECTION 6.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on December 31, 2019, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to: (i) provide each employee of the Company and
of each of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an "
_Employee_ ") with a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual,
quarterly or monthly, as applicable, cash incentive compensation opportunity,
to the extent applicable, which are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual, quarterly
or monthly, as applicable, cash incentive compensation opportunity, to the
extent applicable, provided by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary to each such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) provide the Employees, in the aggregate, with employee benefits
(excluding equity compensation, retention payments and benefits, and non-
qualified deferred compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those employee benefits (excluding equity compensation, retention
payments and benefits, and non-qualified deferred compensation) provided to
such Employees, in the aggregate, immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, Parent hereby agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2019, it shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to adopt an equity
incentive compensation plan and provide officers and key employees with
eligibility for equity-based compensation on terms and conditions as
determined by Parent from time to time. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in
accordance with their terms, all Plans disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals or participation eligibility
under any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-employment
medical or other similar benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Employees vacation and sick time accruals, as of the Effective Time, shall
carry-over to the Parent, Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.05_ shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in
a duplication of benefits for the same period.

(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Company ("
_Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause the insurance
carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if
any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to

 



35

    

 each Employee and any covered dependent under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit
Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan, and (ii) provide
credit to each Employee and any covered dependent for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee or any covered
dependent under the Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including
the Effective Time to the extent credited under a comparable Plan.

(d) The provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ are included for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.05_, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary
or other rights in any other person, including, without limitation, any
employees, former employees, any participant in any Plan or other benefit plan
or arrangement, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to
continued employment with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any Employee. Nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Plan or any employee benefit plan or arrangement
of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, shall require Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to continue any Plan or other
employee benefit plan or arrangement or shall limit the right of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan
or other employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms.

 

SECTION 6.06 _Further Action_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain promptly all authorizations,
consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits, and waivers of all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, (ii) cooperate fully with the Company to obtain promptly all
such authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and
waivers, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide such other
information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may
lawfully request in connection herewith, and (iv) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, each party shall, and shall cause its respective "Ultimate
Parent Entity" (whether one or more, as such term is defined in the HSR Act)
and its respective Subsidiaries to, make its respective filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and shall supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to, and shall
cause its respective Ultimate Parent Entity and its respective Subsidiaries
to, make as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) thereof its respective filings and
notifications, if any, required to obtain Transaction Approvals, and to supply
as promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to applicable Law. Parent will pay all fees or make other
payments to any Governmental Authority in order to make such filings or obtain
any such authorizations, consents, Orders or approvals. 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and
shall cause their Ultimate Parent Entity and its respective Subsidiaries (if
applicable) to, take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of its and their
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, and entering into such other
arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of any
injunction, temporary

 



36

    

 restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall
contest and bring or defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, and the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions prior to the
Outside Date; _provided_ , _ _ _however_ , that such obligation to litigate
in no way limits the obligation of Parent to use, and cause its Ultimate
Parent Entity and its respective Subsidiaries to use, its and their best
efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law to consummate the Transactions prior to the
Outside Date.

(c) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating thereto, and (ii) keep each other reasonably
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties hereto of any
material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and
shall permit the other parties to review in advance (and to consider in good
faith any comments made by the other party in relation to) any proposed
substantive communication by such party to any Governmental Authority
relating to such matters; _provided_ , ___however_ , that materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it
consults with the other parties a reasonable amount of time in advance and,
unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. The parties to this Agreement will reasonably coordinate and
cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement shall provide each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between
them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ , ___however_ , that materials may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Transactions; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall obligate or be
construed to obligate the Company to make or cause to be made any payment or
concession to any third party to obtain any such consent; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the obtaining of any such consents shall not be deemed to be
a condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions.

(d) None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub, or any
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that reasonably
would be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time required,
to: (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required under
any other applicable Antitrust Law, applicable to the Transactions, (ii) avoid
the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other Order that

 



37

    

 would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, or
(iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 6.07 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all
actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and
discharge by Merger Sub hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub
shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity
of any nature except as provided in or expressly contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except with respect
to any matters contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, _Section_ __ _ 8.01,_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except
to the extent public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or non-United States securities exchange on
which the Shares are then traded, in which case the issuing party shall use
its reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any
press release or making any such public statements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each party hereto may, without such consultation, make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by
the Company with the SEC, so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties hereto (or individually in accordance with this  _Section_ __
_ 6.08_). Prior to making any written communications to the employees or
independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining
to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions, the
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of first use, and the Company
shall consider in good faith any comments made to such communication
(it being understood that any subsequent communication that sets forth
substantially the same information shall not require compliance with this
sentence); provided, however, that with respect to the Companys initial
communication subject to the requirements of this sentence, Parents review
must be done promptly so that the communication may be made immediately
following the public announcement relating to the Agreement. Parent, Merger
Sub and their Affiliates may, without consultation with, or consent of, the
Company, make non-public ordinary course disclosures and communications to
existing or prospective general and limited partners, equityholders, members,
managers and investors of such person, if the persons receiving such
disclosures and communications are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions restricting public dissemination or use of such information;
_provided_ , that such disclosures and communications do not include any
material non-public and/or proprietary information of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary.

 

SECTION 6.09 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Parent and the
Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer,
stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and
any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other
fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Parent shall cause the Companys
securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange
Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to
accomplish the foregoing.

 



38

    

SECTION 6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the commencement of, and promptly advise Parent of any material
developments with respect to, any stockholder litigation brought or threatened
in writing against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the
Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall be entitled to
direct and control the defense of any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall consult with, and shall give Parent the
right to, participate in the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to,
acting on its behalf, consent to the entry of any judgment, offer to settle or
settle any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
then the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

SECTION 6.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of
the Debt Financing and shall use best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Equity Financing, in each case, on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters (as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified, waived
or superseded to the extent not prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ below)
on a timely basis (after giving effect to the Marketing Period) to facilitate
the Closing when required by _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, including using such
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters until the
Transactions are consummated, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_
") consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters (including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter), in each case which
terms shall not impose new or additional expand on the conditions to the
funding of the proceeds from the Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective
Time or reduce the aggregate amount of the proceeds from the Debt Financing
below the Required Amount (taking into account cash on hand), and (iii)
satisfy (or obtain waivers of) on a timely basis all conditions in the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries to obtain the Financing and to the
extent within their control. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the
availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied (or upon funding
will be satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Lenders, and shall cause the Equity Investors, to fund at
or prior to the Effective Time the Financing required to consummate the
Transactions (including by seeking through litigation to enforce their rights
under the Equity Commitment Letters). Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to comply with their respective obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent that a failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent the availability
of all or a portion of the proceeds of the Financing when required pursuant
to this Agreement in a timely and diligent manner. Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) permit any amendment, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace,
the Commitment Letters if such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement would (w) be reasonably expected to adversely affect the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against any of the other parties
to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements, (x) add new
(or expand, amend, or otherwise modify any existing) conditions to the
receipt of the Financing in a manner that would be reasonably expected to (1)
prevent, delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely
consummate the Merger at the Closing or any of the Transactions (2) make the
timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, (y) reduce the amount of the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees

 



39

    

 to be paid in respect of the Debt Financing or original issue discount in
respect of the Debt Financing) below an amount that, when combined with
Parents and Merger Subs other sources of funds, is sufficient to fund the
Required Amount or (z) in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter, otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or adversely affect the ability of the Company to specifically enforce
the provisions thereof in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter; _provided_ , that Parent or Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter (1) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement, (2) to modify pricing or implement or exercise any of
the flex provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that
would not reduce the amount of the Financing below the Required Amount, and
(3) to reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or
between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with
the terms thereof as in effect on the date hereof. Upon any such permitted
amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing" shall refer to the Debt
Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced
and the debt financing contemplated thereby.

 

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner contemplated in the Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions)
(other than as a result of the termination of the Commitment Letters on the
Outside Date pursuant to the terms thereof), Parent and Merger Sub will (i)
use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
financing which (x) shall be in an amount, when combined with Merger Subs and
Parents other cash on hand or committed source of funds, equal to the
Required Amount) from the same or other sources and on terms (unless
otherwise agreed by Parent) and conditions not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those in the Commitment Letters
(including, in the case of the Debt Financing, the "flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letter) as in effect on the date hereof, with it
being understood and agreed that if Parent and Merger Sub proceed with any
alternative financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be subject to the same
obligations with respect to such alternative financing as set forth in this
Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing, and (y) shall not contain any
terms that would not be permitted to be effected without the prior written
consent of the Company by an amendment, modification or waiver of the
Commitment Letters pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_, and (ii) promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and
"Equity Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter
(or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged
in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment
Letter, as applicable, remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent
and Merger Sub shall, upon the request of the Company, keep the Company fully
informed, in all reasonable detail, of the status of their efforts to arrange
the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (i) of (A) any
material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware,
(B) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Lender, Equity Investor, or other financing source with respect to (x) any
actual default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of any provision thereof, or
(C) any material dispute or disagreement between or among Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Lenders, on the other hand, or among any Lenders
to any of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing that would reasonably
be expected to result in a failure to receive the proceeds of the Financing
or delay, impair or prevent the Closing or a reduction in the amount of
proceeds of the Debt Financing to be received at Closing and (ii) if at any
time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it is
reasonably likely that a party to the Commitment Letters will fail to fund the
Financing or reduce the amount of the Financing and, as a result thereof, the
aggregate cash amount of funding commitments thereunder (after giving effect
to any corresponding increases), when combined with Parents and Merger Subs
other sources of funds, would be less than the Required Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their
obligations to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

  



40

    

(c) From the date hereof and until the Closing, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, provide such cooperation as
is customary for financings of this type and/or as may be reasonably requested

utilized in connection therewith (other than written information provided by

gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the Company, its Affiliates,
or any of their respective Representatives as determined in a final non-

failure of the Transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any
breach (whether a Willful and Material Breach, unilateral or otherwise) of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, and following termination of this Agreement, other than
the right to receive the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (if owed) in
accordance with and subject to the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)(iv)_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited Guarantees, the
Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party

to any other remedy, whether based on a claim at Law or in equity, in
Contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in

Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
written or oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith.

have the meaning assigned to such term in  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(g)(i)_,
except that references to 15% in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition thereof

recapitalization share exchange, joint venture, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction would cease to own directly or indirectly at least 50% of the
voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (or of another
person that directly or indirectly would own all or substantially all the
assets of the Company) immediately following such transaction substantially in
the same proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of such
transaction."

 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee specified in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_, as applicable, is not a penalty, but, in each case, is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which
such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, or
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, more than once.

substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its stockholders shall have
suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate such other party and its stockholders and that such other party
(on behalf of itself and its stockholders) shall be entitled to enforce

be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger unless (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section_

being satisfied at such time), (ii) the Debt Financing (including any
replacement debt financing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_) has been

therewith, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in
writing that, if the Equity Commitment and Debt Commitment (including any

Each party further agrees that no other party or any other person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in

this  _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it

performance which results in the consummation of the Merger, on the one hand,

Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Limited Guarantees, the Equity
Commitment Letters, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement or

against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such court does not have jurisdiction over such Action,
such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any federal or state

brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of
the above named courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto,
including on behalf of their respective Affiliates, (a) agrees that it will
not bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at Law or in

Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby,

York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (c) agrees that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided

any such action brought in any such court, (d) waives and hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court
and (e) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law.

THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT

by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors (or
equivalent governing body) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, ___however_ , that, after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no
amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of
consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon consummation of
the Merger or that would otherwise require the approval of the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, unless such approval is obtained.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

 



51

    

 contained herein, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_, _Section_ __
_ 9.08_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b),_ and the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.15(b)_ (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or

obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

SECTION 9.14 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates

applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is
reasonably apparent from the text thereof. Certain items and matters may be
listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only and
may not be required to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no
event shall the listing of items or matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule
be deemed or interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. The
mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty (x) shall not be deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material event, circumstance,
change, effect, development or condition or that such item would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and (y) shall not be construed as an
admission by the Company of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any
third party rights or any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority, such
disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions
to the representations made herein or of disclosing any information required
to be disclosed under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no
reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any Contract
or agreement, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication
that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be

negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), (iii) any breach or violation of this Agreement, and

such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated hereunder), in the case
of each of _clauses (i)_  _(iv)_ other than (A) the Companys right to

 specifically enforce the Equity Commitment Letters in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity

(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby agrees not to bring or support
any Action against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
provided that, following consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not
limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under any commitment
letter related thereto. No Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.
