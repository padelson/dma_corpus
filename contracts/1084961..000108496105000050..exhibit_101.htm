        (i)   |    If the Cut-off Claim Amount of Accounts
transferred pursuant to Forward Flow  Transfers is less than $270 million in
any given six-month period during the  Term, the Forward Flow Transfer
Payments shall be reduced in the following  six-month period by an amount
that is determined by multiplying the Cut-off  Claim Amount of Accounts
transferred pursuant to Forward Flow Transfers for the  six-month period that
is less than $270 million (the  " _Shortfall_ "), by the factor set forth on
_Schedule 2.4_   attached hereto (such amount, the " _Shortfall Adjustment_
"). If  the total Cut-off Claim Amount of the Accounts transferred pursuant
to the  Forward Flow Transfers in the following 120 days is insufficient to
offset the  Shortfall, Seller shall pay Buyer the portion of the Shortfall
Adjustment from  the prior six-month period that has not been offset.   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)   |    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 2.4(c)(i) above, if CCRT,  its Affiliates or its joint venture
partners elects not to sell Accounts to  Seller that are otherwise available
to be sold, or Seller elects not to sell  Accounts to Buyer that are
otherwise available to be sold (other than Excess  Eligible Accounts which
sale shall be governed by Paragraphs 2.2(c) and 2.2(d)),  in either case that
results in the Cut-off Claim Amount of Accounts transferred  pursuant to
Forward Flow Transfers being less than $50 million in any  consecutive two-
month period, Seller shall pay to Buyer within ten days after  the end of
such two-month period an amount that is determined by multiplying (x)  the
difference between $90 million and the Cut-off Claim Amount of Accounts 
transferred in such two-month period (a " _Bi-Monthly_   _Shortfall_ "), by
(y) the factor set forth on _Schedule 2.4_   attached hereto (such amount, a
" _Bi-Monthly_ _Shortfall  Adjustment_ "), _plus_ the amount of any Shortfall
Adjustment from  the prior six-month period that has not been offset. The
amount of any  Bi-Monthly Shortfall that results in a Bi-Monthly Shortfall
Adjustment payment  shall reduce the Yearly Minimum and the $3.25 billion
commitment of Seller for  purposes of determining the expiration of the Term.
  
---|--- 
    
        (iii)   |    Once the total Cut-off Claim Amount of
Accounts transferred pursuant to the  Forward Flow Transfers is equal to or
greater than $2.4 billion, up to $5.0  million of the Escrow may be used to
pay any Shortfall Adjustments, and once the  total Cut-off Claim Amount of
Accounts transferred pursuant to the Forward Flow  Transfers is equal to or
greater than $3.0 billion, the remaining portion of the  Escrow may be used
to pay any Shortfall Adjustments. The amount of any Shortfall  associated
with a Shortfall Adjustment paid shall reduce the Yearly Minimum and  the
$3.25 billion commitment of Seller for purposes of determining the 
expiration of the Term. Seller shall be entitled to recover all or a portion
of  any Shortfall Adjustment so paid if in any subsequent period Seller
exceeds its  aggregate minimum volume requirements to such date under the
Forward Flow  Transfers; _provided_ , _however_ , any recovery of a
Shortfall  Adjustment payment shall reverse the previous reduction resulting
from such  Shortfall in the Yearly Minimum and the $3.25 billion commitment
of Seller for  purposes of determining the expiration of the Term.   
---|--- 
    
    3.   _Repurchase of Certain Accounts_ __.

      | 3.1  |   _Ineligible Forward Flow Accounts_ __. In the event

the applicable Closing Date and continuing for 180 days thereafter (the "
_Guarantee Period_ "), shall repurchase such Ineligible Forward Flow Account
for an amount equal to (i) the Forward Flow Price Percentage multiplied by
(ii) the Cut-off Claim Amount of each such Ineligible Forward Flow Account
minus any payments received thereon by Buyer, prior to the date
such Ineligible Forward Flow Accounts are repurchased. Sellers obligation
regarding any Ineligible Forward Flow Accounts shall terminate upon the

comply with the representations and warranties set forth in Paragraph 5.1(a)
that are made with respect to a Forward Flow Transfer and Paragraph 5.1(b) of

criteria shall be the repurchase obligation pursuant to this Paragraph 3.1.
  
---|---|--- 
   
    more than 1% of the total Cut-off Claim Amount of Accounts (other than the
NFE Accounts) included in the Account Purchase are Ineligible Purchased
Accounts at the time of the Account Purchase Closing Date, then Seller,

Paragraph 5.1(c) of this Agreement. Other than Buyers right to seek
indemnification pursuant to Paragraph 9.1(a), the sole remedy for a breach of

obligation pursuant to this Paragraph 3.2.

Paragraph 5.1(a)(viii) (but not any obligation of indemnification for a
breach prior to such expiration) will expire at the end of the relevant
Guarantee Period with respect to any Ineligible Forward Flow Account and
any Ineligible Purchased Account.

      | 11.11  |   _Further Assurance_ __. From and after the date
hereof, each party will take such action as the other party may reasonably
request to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.   
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.12  |   _Relationship_ __. Nothing in this Agreement
establishes an agency, joint venture, partnership or fiduciary relationship
between the parties and neither party has the right or authority to act for
or on behalf of the other party.   
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.13  |   _Limitations of Liability_ __. Seller, Buyer and
their Affiliates will not be liable, under any circumstances, to each other
or any other person or entity for lost profits or any consequential,
indirect, exemplary, special, punitive or incidental damages, whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable.   
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.14  |   _Securities_ __. The parties mutually represent and
warrant that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not involve,
nor are they intended in anyway to constitute, the sale, or purchase, of a

or regulations.   
---|---|--- 
   
    provision of this Agreement only confers rights and remedies upon, and is for
the sole and exclusive benefit of Seller and Buyer and their respective
Affiliates. No other person or entity has any rights or remedies, or is a
direct or indirect beneficiary of, or has any direct or indirect cause of
action or claim in connection with this Agreement, and none of the provisions
of this Agreement will be deemed to be for the benefit of (or enforceable by)

the benefit of any indemnified parties.   
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.16  |   _Waiver of Jury Trial_ __. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the parties (after consulting or having had the opportunity
to consult with legal counsel) knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive
any right either of them may have to a trial by jury in any action or other
legal proceeding based upon, relating to, or arising out of this Agreement or
any other thing, matter or related transaction in connection herewith. The
parties shall not seek to consolidate, by counterclaim or otherwise,
any action in which a jury trial has been waived with any other action in
which a jury trial cannot be waived. This waiver applies to any action or
legal proceeding, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise.   
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.17  |   _No Strict Construction_ __. The parties hereto
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event of an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as drafted jointly by the parties hereto,
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement or any of its provisions.
  
---|---|--- 
   
      | 11.18  |   _Dispute Resolution_ __. Any dispute, claim,
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or its breach, or
any issues regarding the enforceability or coverage of this arbitration
provision, will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association, as such rules shall be in effect on the date of
delivery of demand for arbitration, which arbitration will be held in New
York, New York, or such other city and state as mutually agreed upon. Each
party shall pay the fees of its own attorneys, the expenses of witnesses and
all other expenses connected with the presentation of such party s case,
except that the arbitrators may impose all such fees, costs and expenses
otherwise payable by the prevailing party on the losing party if they
determine that the losing partys position was taken without good faith or
solely for the purpose of delay. The costs of the arbitration including the
cost of the record of transcripts thereof, if any, administrative fees, and
all other fees and costs, shall be divided equally between the parties,
except that the arbitrators may impose all such fees, costs and expenses
otherwise payable by the prevailing party on the losing party if
they determine that the losing partys position was taken without good faith
or solely for the purpose of delay. Except as otherwise limited by this
Agreement, the arbitrators will be empowered to award damages in the amount
established by the preponderance of the evidence. The arbitrators will have
no authority to award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by
the prevailing partys actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any
ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement. The arbitrators also will have the authority to grant any
temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief they deem just
and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, an injunction or order for specific performance. Any award will
be final and binding upon the parties and their successors and permitted
assigns, without appeal or review, except as permitted by the laws of New
York. Any party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
for confirmation and entry of judgment based on the award of the arbitrators.

          | a)   |   Buyer shall not sell or otherwise transfer any
Account purchased hereunder to a  third party at any time without the prior
written consent of Seller, such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any Chapter 7
bankruptcy Account included  in the Account Purchase may only be resold by
Buyer within the 12-month period  following the bankruptcy filing date of
such Account; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall Buyer transfer
more than forty percent  (40%) of the Accounts purchased by Buyer on each
Closing Date (excluding  Accounts Buyer is required to sell to Seller and
excluding Chapter 7 bankruptcy  Accounts included in the Account Purchase)
within the first twelve months after  such Closing Date. Buyer shall provide
Seller in accordance with Paragraph 11.1  and in accordance with Schedule
11.19 setting forth the information in  _Exhibit I_. Thereafter, Seller shall
have seven (7) Business Days from the  date of such notice to provide its
consent. In the event Seller fails to respond  to Buyer within the prescribed
period of time, Seller shall be deemed to have  consented to the transaction
set forth in the notice. Upon any such transfer,  Buyer will not be relieved
of any of Buyers obligations under this  Agreement even to the extent such
obligations are transferred to and assumed by  the third party.   
---|---|--- 
    
          | b)   |   As a condition of any subsequent assignment,
sale or other transfer of Accounts,  Buyer must attach, as an exhibit to
Buyers agreement, a redacted copy of  this Agreement (after deleting any
numerical expressions relating to the  Purchase Price, Forward Flow Price
Percentage, Account Purchase Putback Factor  and Forward Flow Transfer
Payments) and Buyer must also: (i) have any assignee  explicitly assume each
and every term or condition under this Agreement; (ii)  explicitly name
Seller and Originating Creditor as third-party beneficiaries of  the
agreement and (iii) grant to Seller and Originating Creditor in Buyers 
agreement a direct right to bring a cause of action against any assignee,
buyer  or other transferee. Nothing contained in this Agreement will relieve
Buyer from  its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement and Buyer
will remain, under  all circumstances, liable to Seller for the matters set
forth in this Agreement  including, without limitation, the acts and
omissions of Buyer, the acts or  omissions of its assignees, any successors-
in-interest, or any other transferees  of the Accounts or this Agreement.
Buyer will be as fully liable (and  responsible) to Seller for the acts and
omissions of any subcontractor (or any  other entities engaged by Buyer or it
agents) as it is for the acts and  omissions of its own employees and agents.
