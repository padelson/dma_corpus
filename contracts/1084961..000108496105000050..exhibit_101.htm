applicable to such<B> </B>Account, elects to request the return of, in its sole
discretion, an Ineligible Forward Flow Account or an Ineligible Purchased Account (each, a

Association, as such rules shall be in effect on the date of delivery of demand for
arbitration, which arbitration will be held in New York, New York, or such other city and
state as mutually agreed upon. Each party shall pay the fees of its own attorneys, the
expenses of witnesses and all other expenses connected with the presentation of such
party&#146;s case, except that the arbitrators may impose all such fees, costs and
expenses otherwise payable by the prevailing party on the losing party if they determine
that the losing party&#146;s position was taken without good faith or solely for the
purpose of delay. The costs of the arbitration including the cost of the record of
transcripts thereof, if any, administrative fees, and all other fees and costs, shall be

be empowered to award damages in the amount established by the preponderance of the
evidence. The arbitrators will have no authority to award punitive damages or any other
damages not measured by the prevailing party&#146;s actual damages, and may not, in any
event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The arbitrators also will have the authority to grant any temporary,
preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief they deem just and equitable and
within the scope of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, an injunction or order
for specific performance. Any award will be final and binding upon the parties and their
successors and permitted assigns, without appeal or review, except as permitted by the
laws of New York. Any party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
confirmation and entry of judgment based on the award of the arbitrators. </FONT></TD>
