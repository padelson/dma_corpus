(30) days following the AGP Resolution Date.

the application of GAAP results in a substantial change to any Adjusted Gross
Profit Target, then the parties will work together to determine revised
percentage payouts that reasonably preserve the intent of _Section

Earn-Out Payment are included as _Exhibit B_ to this Agreement, (ii)
Sellers, Holdco and Company agree that Purchasers have ultimate authority
over the operation of the Business following the Closing Date, Purchasers do

HSR Act at the time of such issuance (the " ** _HSR Threshold_** "), then

the amount in excess of the applicable HSR Threshold and, in lieu of issuing
such shares, deliver to such Person an amount of cash equal to such value.

protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded such Confidential Information.

unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement
to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or
portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this

shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or scope limitations, as
the case may be, permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

contemplated by this Agreement and (2) Holdcos and Sellers agreements as
set forth herein are necessary to preserve the value of the Purchased Assets
and the Business, including its goodwill and customer relationships, for
Purchasers following Closing. Holdco and Sellers also acknowledge that the

will be responsible for all severance payments, damages for
wrongful dismissal and all related costs in respect of the termination by
Company of the employment of any Designated Employee who does not become a

jurisdiction that the terms of offer made to such Designated Employee was not

injury, disability, death or workers compensation arising from or related

comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the offer
and sale or other disposition of all securities proposed to be registered in

shall have the right at any time after the fifteenth (15th) NASDAQ Global
Market trading day following the date on which the Registration Statement is
declared effective to require that Sellers suspend open market offers and
sales of CLNE Shares for the period of time specified in this _Section
6.15(c)_ if, in the reasonable, good-faith judgment of Purchasers, there is
in existence material undisclosed information or events with respect to
Purchasers (the " ** _Suspension Right_** "). In the event Purchasers exercise
the Suspension Right, such suspension will continue for the shorter of (i)
the period of time reasonably necessary for disclosure to occur at a time
that is not materially detrimental to Purchasers or (ii) the period until
such time as the information or event is no longer material, each as

Company, Holdco and Sellers, on the other hand;

  



  

(b) by either Purchasers, on the one hand, or Company, Holdco and Sellers, on

upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Purchasers by
Sellers, Holdco or Company for use in connection with such registration
statement, prospectus or post-effective amendment; or

(c) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Sellers and
Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Purchaser
Parties based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations,

(or capable of being acquired) by Purchasers or any Purchaser Representative
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing, with respect to, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

or limit the provisions of this _Article IX_.

  



        
   

  



  

 **9.3 Procedures for Indemnification**.

  



  

(a) _Notice_.  Promptly after the appropriate management personnel of any
Purchaser Party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an " **
_Indemnified Party_** ") (i) become aware of circumstances that
have resulted in, or which are reasonably likely to result in, Damages for
which the Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification for or (ii)
receive written notice of any third-party demand, claim or circumstances
which, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both, are reasonably
likely to give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened
commencement) of any Proceeding that may result in Damages for which the
Indemnified Party may be indemnified hereunder (an " ** _Asserted
Liability_** "), the Indemnified Party shall give notice thereof (a " **
_Claims Notice_** ") to any other party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification hereunder (an " ** _Indemnifying Party_** "). The
Claims Notice shall describe the Damages or the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail to the extent known, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary and if reasonably capable of estimation) of the
Damages that has been or that may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The
Claims Notice may be amended on one or more occasions with respect to the
amount of the Asserted Liability or the Damages at any time prior to final
resolution of the obligation to indemnify relating to the Asserted Liability
or the Damages. If a Claims Notice is not provided promptly as required by
this _Section 9.3_, the Indemnified Party nonetheless shall be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement by the Indemnifying Party except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by such late
receipt of a Claims Notice.  Any Asserted Liability for indemnification for
any matter not involving a third-party Proceeding shall be paid promptly
after delivery to the Indemnifying Party of a Claims Notice relating to such
Asserted Liability.

  



  

(b) _Opportunity to Contest_. The Indemnifying Party may, provided that
it has acknowledged its responsibility to indemnify with respect to an
Asserted Liability, elect to compromise or contest, at its own expense and
with counsel of its choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party,
such Asserted Liability; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to assume or continue the defense of any Asserted Liability if (i)
in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, counsel for the
Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnified Party because its interests could be in conflict with those of
the Indemnifying Party; (ii) such Proceeding is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on any other matter beyond the scope or limits of the
indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party; or (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not have assumed and diligently continued the
defense of the Proceeding in a timely fashion and in a manner reasonably
acceptable to Indemnified Party. In addition, if the Indemnifying Party
has assumed the defense of a Proceeding, Indemnifying Party shall take
all reasonably necessary steps to defend the relevant Asserted Liability
to conclusion or settlement, keep the Indemnified Party informed of the
progress of any such Asserted Liability, permit the Indemnified Party at its
own expense to participate in such defense and provide the Indemnified Party
with reasonable access to all reasonably relevant information and
documentation relating to the Asserted Liability and the Indemnifying Partys
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or contest
such Asserted Liability, it shall, within 20 days (or sooner, if the nature
of the Asserted Liability so requires), notify the Indemnified Party of its
intent to do so by sending a notice to the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Contest
Notice_** "); and, in any such event, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise or
contest of such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or contest the

  



        
   

  



  

Asserted Liability, fails to notify, in a timely manner, the Indemnified
Party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to
indemnify under this Agreement with respect to such Asserted Liability, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, compromise or contest such
Asserted Liability on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party. Anything in this  _Section 9.3(b)_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own
cost and for its own account, to compromise or contest any Asserted
Liability, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys written consent, settle or compromise any Asserted Liability for
Taxes, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys written consent, settle or compromise any Asserted Liability not for
Taxes or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such Asserted
Liability which does not include an unconditional term releasing the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all Liability in respect of such
Asserted Liability. In any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party may participate, at their own expense, in the contest of an Asserted
Liability. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with each other as to all Asserted Liabilities (at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party), shall make available to each other, as reasonably
requested, all information, records, and documents reasonably related to all

 **9.4 Limitations on Indemnification**.

  



  

(a) No amount shall be payable by Sellers, Company or Holdco to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect
to Damages related to breach of a Specified Rep) unless the aggregate amount
of Damages indemnifiable by Sellers, Company or Holdco under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to Damages related to breach of a
Specified Rep) exceeds an amount (the " ** _Sellers  Basket_**") equal to
Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($700,000), at which point Sellers, Company
and Holdco shall become liable for all such Damages, including the Damages
reflected in Sellers Basket.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
maximum amount of aggregate indemnifiable Damages which may be recovered from
Sellers, Company or Holdco under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (other than with
respect to Damages related to breach of a Specified Rep) shall be an amount
equal to Twenty-One Million Dollars ($21,000,000) (" ** _Sellers 
Indemnification Cap_**").

  



  

(c) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this _Section
9.4_ shall not apply to any Seller, Holdco or Company indemnification
obligation (x) arising out of, relating to or resulting from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Holdco, Company or any Seller; (y)
arising out of, relating to or resulting from a breach of any of the
Specified Reps; or (z) arising out of, relating to or resulting under

Indemnification Cap.

  

 ** **

  

 **9.5 Offset**. To the extent an Indemnified Party has provided a Claims
Notice before a payment is due under Future Payment Note #3 and/or _Section
1.9(c)(iv)_, and such Claims Notice is not resolved, Purchasers shall be
permitted to withhold from such payment, and any subsequent payments, until
such Claims Notice is resolved, a reasonable amount as a reserve to cover the
potential indemnification obligations of Sellers, Company and Holdco with
respect to such Claims Notice. Any amounts withheld by Purchasers pursuant to
this _Section 9.5_, other than amounts otherwise owed by Sellers, Company
and Holdco to satisfy Sellers, Companys and Holdcos indemnification
obligations under this Agreement, shall be promptly released to Sellers,
Company and Holdco following the resolution of any such Claims Notice.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the exercise nor
non-exercise of Purchasers rights to offset under this _Section 9.5_ will
constitute an election of remedies or limit Purchasers in any way in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it under this
Agreement.

  



  

 **9.6 Remedies Cumulative**. The remedies provided in this Agreement
shall be cumulative and shall not preclude any party from asserting any other
right, or seeking any other remedies, against the other party.

  



  

 **9.7 ****Nature of Indemnification Payments**. Any indemnification payment
made by Sellers pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be deemed by the parties
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

audit, Sellers and Company may not amend (or permit the amendment of) a Tax
Return of any Company Subsidiary, or make, amend or revoke (or permit the

 **10.2 Straddle Period Allocations**. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes
of any of the Company Subsidiaries incurred with respect to a taxable period
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, shall be allocated to the

identification basis, according to the date of the event or transaction
giving rise to the Tax, and (ii) except as provided in (iii) below, with
respect to periodically assessed ad valorem Taxes and Taxes not
otherwise feasibly allocable to specific transactions or events, in
proportion to the number of days in such taxable period occurring through the
Closing Date compared to the total number of days in such taxable period, and
(iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, in
an amount equal to the Tax which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended on the Closing Date.

shall provide Purchasers with an executed Section 85 Election, Section 22

 **10.5 ****Allocation of Purchase Price**. As soon as practicable after the
Final Resolution Date, Purchasers shall provide to Seller, Company and Holdco
for their review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant
to _Section 1.10_, among the various classes of Purchased Assets.  None of
the parties shall take a position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental
Authority or in any judicial proceeding that is in any manner inconsistent
with such allocation without the written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement or unless specifically required pursuant to a determination by an
applicable Governmental Authority. The parties shall promptly advise each
other of the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to
any allocation hereunder. Any dispute arising under this _Section 10.5_
shall be resolved in the same manner as disputes are resolved pursuant to
_Section 1.10(c)_ above.

  



  

 **10.6 Cooperation, Access to Information, and Record Retention**. If any of
Purchasers, Company, or Sellers receives any notice of a pending or
threatened Tax assessment, adjustment, audit, litigation or other proceeding
relating to Company or any of Company Subsidiaries, which may give rise to a
liability of another party hereto (including but not limited to
indemnification obligations hereunder), (i) the first party shall promptly
notify such other party within ten (10) business days of receiving such
notice, and (ii) both parties shall keep each other informed on a regular
basis regarding the status thereof. Purchasers, Sellers, and Company
shall cooperate, and cause their representatives and Affiliates to cooperate,
to the extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Company, Company Subsidiaries, Purchasers and Sellers
shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns
of Company and Company Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified, any extensions thereof) with respect thereto, (ii) abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority,
and (iii) give the other parties hereto reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
another party so requests, allow such party to take possession of such books
and records.

courier service, or by facsimile, with confirmation of receipt on such date.

  



  

(c) Any party hereto may change its address specified for notices herein by
designating a new address by notice given in accordance with this _Section
11.4_.

  



         
 

  



  

 **11.5 Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, the schedules, the exhibits and
the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior oral and written understandings, all contemporaneous oral
negotiations and discussions, and all other writings and agreements relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.6 Modifications, Amendments and Waivers**. This Agreement and any
Transaction Agreements cannot be amended or changed nor any performance,
term, or condition waived in whole or in part, except by a writing signed by
the party against whom enforcement of the amendment, change or waiver is
sought. No delay or failure on the part of any party in exercising any rights
hereunder, and no partial or single exercise thereof, will constitute a
waiver of such rights or of any other rights hereunder.

  



  

 **11.7 Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement cannot be assigned by
any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any assignment in violation of this _Section 11.7_ shall be null and void;
provided that Purchasers may assign this Agreement and any
Transaction Agreement (i) to Affiliates of Purchasers or (ii) following
Closing, in connection with any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, sale of
any Purchasers assets or similar corporate transaction, including a sale or
transfer of the Purchased Assets.

  



  

 **11.8 Governing Law**. This Agreement is to be construed in accordance with
and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware or any similar
successor provision, without giving effect to any choice of law rule
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the rights and duties of the
parties.

  



  

 **11.9 Severability**. Should any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed severed
herefrom, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The
parties shall replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as practicable
to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

  



  

 **11.10 Specific Performance**. Each party agrees that irreparable harm,
for which there will be no adequate remedy at law and for which the
ascertainment of monetary damages would be difficult, would occur in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  Each party
accordingly agrees that the other parties shall be entitled to specifically
enforce this Agreement and to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof, in each instance without being required to post bond or other
security and in addition to, and without having to prove the adequacy of,
other remedies at law.

  



  

 **11.11 Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts which may be delivered by facsimile, each of which shall
be deemed to be an original, but all of which counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

  



        
   

  



  

 **11.12 Dispute Resolution**.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 1.9_, _Section 1.10_ and _Section
10.5_, any controversy, claim or dispute of whatever nature arising between
Purchasers, on the one hand, and Sellers, Holdco and Company, on the other
hand (each, a " ** _Disputing Party_** ") under this Agreement or in
connection with the Transaction, including those arising out of or relating
to the breach, termination, enforceability, scope, validity, or making of
this Agreement, whether such claim existed prior to or arises on or after the
Closing Date (a " ** _Dispute_** "), shall be resolved by good faith
negotiations among the Disputing Parties, such negotiation not to exceed a
period of thirty (30) consecutive days (the " ** _Negotiation Period_** "). In
the event a Dispute remains unresolved following the Negotiation Period, a
Disputing Party may give written notice (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") to the
other Disputing Party setting forth the nature of the Dispute. Following
delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Dispute shall be submitted to non-binding
mediation with a mediator mutually selected by the parties within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Dispute Notice. The mediator shall have
sixty (60) days from the time of his or her appointment to meet with the
parties and help them resolve the dispute, unless the parties mutually
consent to an extension of the deadline. The costs of the mediation,
including fees and expenses, shall be borne equally by the parties, and the
mediation shall take place in the locality of the party who did not give the
Dispute Notice.

  



  

(b) If the Dispute is not resolved pursuant to _Section 11.12(a)_, any
Dispute relating to this Agreement shall be brought solely in the
federal courts located in Orange County, California and all obligations to
personal jurisdiction and venue in any action, suit or proceeding so
commenced are hereby expressly waived by all parties hereto; provided,
however, that, a party may commence any action or proceeding in a court other
than as set forth above solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of such courts. The parties waive personal service of
any and all process on each of them and consent that all such service of
process shall be made in the manner, to the party and at the address set
forth in _Section 11.4_ of this Agreement, and service so made shall be
complete as stated in such section.  To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements or court rule, each party hereby waives and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise in any such
proceeding, any claim (i) that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, (ii) that the proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (iii) that it is immune from any legal process with respect to itself
or its property, (iv) that the venue of the proceeding is improper or (v)
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

  



  

 **11.13 Attorneys Fees, Costs and Expenses**. In any Proceeding to enforce
the terms of this Agreement or the other documents executed in connection
herewith, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
enforcement Proceeding.

  



  

 **11.14 No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and the parties do not intend to
confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

  



        
   

  



  

 **11.15 Privacy**.  Prior to the First Closing, none of the parties shall
use the Disclosed Personal Information for any purposes other than those
related to the performance of this Agreement and the completion of the
Transaction. Each of the parties acknowledges and confirms that the
disclosure of Personal Information is necessary for the purposes of
determining if the parties shall proceed with the Transaction, and that the
disclosure of Personal Information relates solely to the carrying on of the
business, or the completion of the Transaction. Purchasers shall at all times
keep strictly confidential all Disclosed Personal Information provided to
them. If the First Closing does not occur, Purchasers shall cease all use of
the Disclosed Personal Information acquired by Purchasers in connection with
this Agreement and, at Sellers request, will return to Sellers or destroy in
a secure manner, the Disclosed Personal Information.
