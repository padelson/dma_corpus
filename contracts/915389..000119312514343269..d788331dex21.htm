-iii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 11, 2014 (the "
_Agreement_ "), by and among Eastman Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Stella Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub"_ ), and Taminco Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in _Section 8.19_.

 

 _WITNESSETH:_

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub merge with and into the Company,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the
" _Merger_ "), and that at the Effective Time the Company continue as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") are advisable and in
the best interests of their respective stockholders and, therefore, have
approved the Merger and this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain financial institutions have executed and delivered one or
more commitment letters with respect to certain debt facilities, the proceeds
of which, among other uses, will be used by Parent to fund the payment of a
portion of the Merger Consideration and otherwise satisfy all of Parents and
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the repayment of the
existing credit facility indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries
(such commitment letters, fee letters and/or engagement letters, the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ ").

 

WHEREAS, following the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders (the
" _Principal Stockholders_ ") will execute and deliver to Parent and Merger
Sub support agreements (the " _Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which each
Principal Stockholder will agree, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to act by written consent substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Written Consent_ ") to approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with Section 228 and
Section 251(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ").

WHEREAS, following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will execute and deliver a written consent
adopting this Agreement and approving the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree as follows:  ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease,
and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
" _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the laws of Delaware as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.2  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the later of (a) the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those
conditions at Closing), and (b) the earliest of (i) a date during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on at least three (3) Business Days
notice to the Company and (ii) three (3) Business Days following the final
day of the Marketing Period, provided, however, if the Closing would otherwise
occur within the 10 Business Day period prior to the date on which the
Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or the Companys Annual Report on
Form 10-K (or any amendment to any previously filed Company Report) would be
required to be filed with the SEC, the Closing will occur on the third
Business Day after the filing by the Company of such report (subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions as of the date
determined by this clause). In lieu of the foregoing, the Closing may occur at
such other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing between
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.3  _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, immediately after the
Closing, the parties will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in such form as required by Section 251 of the DGCL
and make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such later time as may be set forth in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time the
Merger becomes effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects provided for in this Agreement and in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to _Section 5.9_, at the Effective Time, (a) the
Certificate of Merger will provide that the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time will be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on
Exhibit B attached hereto and, as so amended and restated, will be the
certificate of incorporation

 



2  of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL and (b) the Amended and Restated By-laws
of the Company, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be
amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit C
attached hereto and, as so amended and restated, will be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties
hereto will take all necessary action such that, from and after the Effective
Time, (a) the officers of the Merger Sub will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation and (b) the directors of Merger Sub will be the initial directors
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacity,
resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent
or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.1(b)_,
_Section 2.1(d)_ and  _Section 2.1(e)_, each issued and outstanding share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Common Stock_ ," and each,
a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the
extent provided, in _Section 2.1(b)_) and Dissenting Shares (as defined, and
to the extent provided in _Section 2.1(d)_), will thereupon be converted
automatically into the right to receive $26.00 per Share in cash without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this 
_Section 2.1_ will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist, and
the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Parent-Owned and Treasury Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company, or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, immediately prior
to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on
behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") will, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange
for such cancellation.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 per share par value of the
Surviving Corporation. Such share will thereafter constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any stockholder of the Company that is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such stockholders Shares
pursuant to, and that complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in  _Section 2.1(a)_, but, instead, such holder will be entitled to
such rights as are granted by Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and automatically will be
cancelled and will cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by
applicable Laws, each holder of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any
rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, other than such rights as are
granted under Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
of Dissenting Shares fails to validly perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then, in each case, the rights of such holder under
Section 262 will cease, and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and will have become, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_. The
Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily
make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect
to, or settle or make a binding offer to settle with (unless it results in the
withdrawal of an appraisal demand), any Dissenting Stockholder regarding its
exercise of dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time. The Company will
give Parent notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any exercise by any stockholder of dissenters rights.

(e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company will occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or
will cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that will be
appointed to act as an exchange agent hereunder and approved in advance by the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to an agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, in trust for the
benefit of holders of Shares, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
pursuant to _Section 2.2_. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent will
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund
will be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
any such direction will require that the Exchange Agent to undertake to
maintain an amount in cash equal to or greater than the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Any interest or other income from such investments will be
paid to and become income of Parent. Parent further agrees, following the
Effective Time, to promptly make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to
time as needed, any additional cash to pay the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



4 (b) Exchange Procedures.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event not later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent
will mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
(x) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
effected and risk of loss and title will pass only upon delivery of Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (y) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares will be
entitled to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered Book-Entry
Shares an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares
represented by such holders properly surrendered Book-Entry Shares and (y)
the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the relevant Merger Consideration to be issued or paid upon due
surrender of the Book-Entry Shares may be issued or paid to such a transferee
if all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable
with respect to such Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by
_Section 2.1(c)_ and this _Section 2.2_, each Book-Entry Share will be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender, without interest, the Merger Consideration.

(c)  _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed, and there will be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they will be cancelled and
exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this _Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_ will thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



5 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent, Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Outstanding Stock Options_.

pay its respective probable liabilities (including the probable amount of all
contingent liabilities) and its respective debts as they become absolute and
matured, (b) the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case at a fair valuation, will exceed its respective

to enforceability. Parent has fully paid, or is paying, substantially
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any

the terms contemplated by this Agreement including repayment of existing
indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and to pay all related fees
and expenses associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under
_Article II_ of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition
of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters. As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letters or
that would, individually or in the aggregate, permit the financial
institutions party thereto to terminate, or to not make the initial funding of
the facilities to be established thereunder upon satisfaction of all
conditions thereto; provided that Parent is not making any representations in
this _Section 4.12_ regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties in _Article III_. Except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment

 



24  Letters, there are no (a) conditions precedent to the respective obligations
of the lenders specified in the Debt Commitment Letters to fund the full
amount of the Financing; or (b) contractual contingencies under any
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing to which

that would permit the lenders specified in the Debt Commitment Letters to
reduce the total amount of the Financing (other than retranching or
reallocating the Financing in a manner that does not reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing), or that would adversely affect the availability of
the Financing.

Section 4.13 _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties expressly made by Parent and Merger Sub in this _Article IV_ ,

respect to the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or their respective business,

Section 5.2 _Investigation_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company will afford to
Parent and to its Representatives upon reasonable advance notice from Parent
reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to the personnel,
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and all other information concerning its business,
operations,

 



29  property and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and any report,
schedule or other document filed or received by such party pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
will not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, would cause a significant risk, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, of a loss of privilege to the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or
would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, nor will Parent or any of
its Representatives be permitted to collect or analyze and environmental
samples or to perform any invasive environmental procedure with respect to any
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If, in the course of any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_, Parent gains knowledge of
any breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
any circumstance or condition that upon Closing would constitute a breach,
Parent covenants that it will promptly so inform the Company in writing.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement dated June 27, 2014 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and each of Parent and
the Company will hold, and will cause its respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and advisors (including attorneys, accountants, consultants,
bankers and financial advisors) to hold, any Evaluation Material (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (and its
and their successors and assigns) to retain all books, ledgers, files,
reports, plans, operating records and any other material documents pertaining
to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in existence at the
Closing that are required to be retained under current retention policies for
a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, and to make the same
available after the Closing for inspection and copying by the Principal
Stockholders or their Representatives. Such inspection and copying will only
be permitted, during normal business hours and upon reasonable request and
upon reasonable advance written notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Surviving Corporation will not be required to afford such access if it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a significant
risk, in the reasonable judgment of the Surviving Corporation, of a loss of
privilege to the Surviving Corporation, or any of its Subsidiaries or would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

 

Section 5.3 _Go Shop; No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 5.3(c)_), during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (New
York time) on the day that is thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement (the " _Go-Shop Period End Date_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives will have the right to (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes an Alternative Proposal, including by
providing information (including non-public information and data) regarding,
and affording access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and
personnel

 



30  of, the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to (x) an
executed confidentiality agreement having provisions as to confidential
treatment of information of the Company that are substantially similar to the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
"standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making
or amendment of any Alternative Proposal), or (y) to the extent applicable,
the confidentiality agreement entered into with such Person or group of
Persons prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) engage in, enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons or group of Persons with respect to any Alternative Proposals and
cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any
Alternative Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) make available to the Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any Person or group of Persons given such access that was not previously made
available to the Parent.

 

(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party until the Cut-Off Date or as
permitted by this _Section 5.3_, after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will, and the Company will cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, cease any activities permitted by _Section
5.3(a)_ and any discussions or negotiations with any Person or group of
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(c) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party until the Cut-Off Date or as
permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from the Go-Shop Period End Date until the
Effective Time, or, if earlier, until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company will not, will cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives not to, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative
Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding an Alternative
Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information regarding an Alternative
Proposal to, any Person or group of Persons that has made an Alternative
Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with
any Person or group of Persons that has made an Alternative Proposal, except
to notify such Person or group of Persons as to the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_, (iv) approve or recommend any Alternative
Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and solely
in response to an unsolicited Alternative Proposal made on or after the Go-
Shop Period End Date and prior to the date that is twenty (20) days after the
mailing of the Information Statement to the stockholders of the Company (the "
_Window Shop End Date_ "), the Company may, with respect to the Person that
has made such Alternative Proposal (i) in response to a request therefor by
such Person, provide information or afford access to the books and records or
Representatives of the Company, and (ii) engage, participate in or facilitate
any discussions or negotiations with such Person (and its Representatives)
with respect to such Alternative Proposal.

 



31  The Company may not take the actions described in this _Section 5.3(d)_
unless, prior to taking any such action:

 

(i) the Company has (1) received from such Person an executed confidentiality
and standstill agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) disclosed or made available
to Parent any non-public information to be provided to such Person and any
books or records to which such Person will be afforded access, in each case,
to the extent not previously provided or otherwise made available to Parent;
and

(ii) the Company has delivered to Parent an unredacted copy of such
Alternative Proposal (or, if not such Alternative Proposal is not in writing,
a written summary of the material terms thereof) and an executed copy of the
confidentiality and standstill agreement.

 

(e) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn or terminated prior to the Window Shop End Date, the Company Board
may withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel
that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or restrict the Company Board from
making a Change of Recommendation (and if the Company Board so chooses, cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_) prior
to the Window Shop End Date to the extent that the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement during the period that is after the Go-Shop
End Date but prior to the Window Shop End Date on account of a Superior
Proposal received during such period that directly resulted from a material
breach by the Company of _Section 5.3(c)_.

(g) Following the delivery of a Termination Notice:

(i) Delivered in connection with a Superior Proposal that was delivered prior
to the Go-Shop Period End Date, if Parent does not deliver to the Company
prior to 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on the date that is four (4) Business
Days following the date of the Termination Notice (the " _Expiration Date_ ")
a written, binding and irrevocable proposal that the Company Board determines
in good faith (taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent as provided in
this _Section 5.3(g)(i)_), after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to the Company and its
stockholders as such Superior Proposal (a " _Parent Superior Proposal_ "), the
Company Board may in its sole discretion immediately cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ without the need for
any further action or notice by any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
Parent Superior Proposal is delivered to the Company on or before the
Expiration Date, then the Cut-Off Date shall be automatically extended (with
respect to the Change of Recommendation Party) to 12:01 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date that is the later of (i) the Business Day that is four (4)
Business Days following

 



32  the date of the Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) the Business Day that is
fifteen (15) days following the Go-Shop Period End Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, during such period, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to, and the
restrictions in _Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_ will not apply to, the
Change of Recommendation Party. At the end of such period, in the event that
the Company Board determines to make a Change of Recommendation in favor of
the Change of Recommendation Party over the Parent Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_ by providing to Parent a new Termination Notice (which notice shall
attach the most current unredacted version of the proposed agreement relating
to such Change of Recommendation Proposal, or if there is no proposed
agreement, a description in reasonable detail of the material terms and
conditions thereof); _provided_ that the Company shall again comply with this
_Section 5.3(g)(i)_ prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(g)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that, upon the delivery of a
Termination Notice in connection with this _Section 5.3(g)(i)_ delivered
after the initial Termination Notice in connection with this  _Section
5.3(g)(i)_, (x) the Cut-Off Date shall be automatically extended with respect
to such Change of Recommendation Party to 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on
the later of (A) the Business Day that is four (4) Business Days following
the date of any Parent Superior Proposal made following such Termination
Notice and (B) the Business Day that is fifteen (15) days following the Go-
Shop Period End Date.

 

(ii) Delivered in connection with a Superior Proposal that was delivered after
the Go Shop End Date but prior to the Window Shop End Date, if Parent does
not deliver to the Company prior to 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on the
Expiration Date a Parent Superior Proposal, the Company Board may in its sole
discretion immediately cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(g)_ without the need for any further action or notice by
any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Parent Superior Proposal is
delivered to the Company on or before the Expiration Date, then the Window
Shop End Date shall be automatically extended (with respect to the Change of
Recommendation Party), if necessary, to 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on the
Business Day that is four (4) Business Days following the date of the Parent
Superior Proposal. At the end of such period, in the event that the Company
Board determines to make a Change of Recommendation in favor of the Change of
Recommendation Party over the Parent Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ by
providing to Parent a new Termination Notice (which notice shall attach the
most current unredacted version of the proposed agreement relating to such
Change of Recommendation Proposal, or if there is no proposed agreement, a
description in reasonable detail of the material terms and conditions
thereof); _provided_ that the Company shall again comply with this _Section
5.3(g)(ii)_ prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(g)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that, upon the delivery of a Termination
Notice in connection with this _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_ delivered after the
initial Termination Notice in connection with this  _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_,
the Window Shop End Date shall be automatically extended, if necessary, with
respect to such Change of Recommendation Party to 12:01 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Business Day that is four (4) Business Days following the date
of any Parent Superior Proposal made following such Termination Notice.

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" 

 



33  statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with applicable Law or with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
provided, however, that any public disclosure made by or on behalf of the
Company that refers to an Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limitation of the rights of the
Company set forth in _Section 5.3(g)_, at any time after the Go-Shop Period
End Date until 11:59 PM on the date that is fifteen (15) days thereafter (the
" _Cut-Off Date_ "), the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to, and the
restrictions in _Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_ will not apply to, any
Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended or modified Alternative
Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the Go-Shop Period End
Date.

(j) The Company may waive or fail to enforce any standstill or similar
provision in any confidentiality or other agreement it has entered into with
any Person or group of Persons, whether prior to or after the date hereof.

 

Section 5.4 _Stockholder Written Consent; Information Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period End
Date, the Company will, in accordance with the DGCL, use its reasonable best
efforts to seek and obtain the Written Consent. If such Written Consent is not
received by the Company and Parent within twenty-four (24) hours following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period End Date, Parent will be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_.

(b) No later than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the Cut-Off Date
(as the same may be extended pursuant to _Section 5.3(g))_, the Company will,
with the reasonable assistance (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned) of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the
Information Statement. The Company will provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement prior to
filing. The Company will use reasonable best efforts as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and after consultation with, and the assistance of, Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) to respond to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. The
Company will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any responses to comments from the SEC on the Information Statement
or any amendments or supplements to the Information Statement prior to the
filing of such responses, amendments or supplements. The Company will cause
the Information Statement (substantially in the form last filed and/or
cleared) to be promptly filed with the SEC in definitive form as contemplated
by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and then to be mailed to the stockholders
of the Company as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
days after the latest of (i) confirmation from the SEC that it has no further
comments on the Information Statement, (ii) confirmation from the SEC that the
Information Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed, (iii) expiration of
the ten (10) day period after filing in the event the SEC does not review the
Information Statement (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "), and (iv) delivery of
the Written Consent.

 



34 (c) Parent will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to, cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Information Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to Parent and its Affiliates required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Information Statement or that is customarily included in
information statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates is discovered
by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party discovering this
information will, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other
parties to this Agreement and, to the extent required by Law, Parent and the
Company will cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing this
information, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to be filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Salary and Wages_. Parent will cause its Affiliates to continue the
employment effective immediately after the Closing Date of all employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Employees_ "), including
each such employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as
of the Closing Date. Until at least December 31, 2015, the continued
employment immediately following the Closing Date of each such Company
Employee will in each case provide compensation, including base salary or base
wage rate and annual cash bonus potential (determined as a percentage of
annual base salary), that is no less favorable, in the aggregate, (but
excluding any equity plan program or arrangement or Parent sponsored severance
plan) than the compensation provided to each such Company Employee on the
Closing Date. Nothing in this  _Section 5.5(a)_ will obligate Parent,
Surviving Corporation or the Company to continue the employment of any such
Company Employee for any specific period.

 

(b) _Employee Benefits_. As of the Closing Date and for a period not to end
before December 31, 2015, Parent will provide, and will cause its Affiliates
to provide, each Company Employee with employee benefits (excluding any equity
plan program or arrangement) that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the employee benefits provided by the Company to Company Employees as of
the date of this Agreement.

(c) _Severance_. Parent will maintain, or and will cause its Affiliates to
maintain, for the benefit of each Company Employee whose employment
terminates at any time from the Closing Date through December 31, 2015, a
severance plan or plans providing benefits, terms and conditions that are not
less favorable to such employees than those provided under the

 



35  Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date. Parent will assume, maintain
and honor the Agreements set forth in _Section 5.5(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter hereto and continue such agreements in accordance with the
terms thereof.

(d) _Employee Service Credit_. Parent (i) will give, and cause its Affiliates
to give, each Company Employee service credit granted by the Company prior to
Closing under any comparable Company Benefit Plan for all purposes (including
eligibility to participate, vesting in eligible benefits and levels of
benefits) other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit
pension plan; _provided_ that Company Employees will not be entitled to the
benefit of any grandfathered benefit formula that would not be provided to any
employee first hired by Parent on or after the Effective Time, (ii) will
give, and cause its Affiliates to give, each Company Employee service credit
granted by the Company prior to Closing under any comparable personnel
policies that cover such Company Employee after the Closing Date, including
any severance, vacation and sick leave, for purposes of entitlement to
benefits thereunder, (iii) will allow, and cause its Affiliates to allow, such
Company Employees to participate in each Company Benefit Plan providing
welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long-term disability
insurance and long-term care insurance) in the plan year in which the Closing
occurs without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations, and
(iv) will credit, and cause its Affiliates to credit, the Company Employee
with any expenses that were covered by the Company Benefit Plans for purposes
of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under the
Company Benefit Plan in which they participate and any similar replacement
plans.

 

(e) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Parent will continue, and cause its
Affiliates to continue, to credit to each Company Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Company Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years) subject to Parents vacation day carryover
policy.

(f) _Labor Agreements_. As of and after the Closing, subject to mutually
agreed upon modifications by the Parties thereto, the Surviving Corporation
or its relevant Subsidiaries will continue (for so long as such contracts are
in effect) to be bound by the agreements set forth in _Section 3.10(m)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(g) _Certain Commitments_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, treat the Transactions as constituting a
"change in control," "change of control" or similar terms under the Company
Benefit Plans and such compensation and severance arrangements or agreements.

 

(h) _Bonus Plans_. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, operate all
annual bonus arrangements other than the Performance Retirement Contribution
Plan (collectively, " _Bonus Plans_ "), as applicable, for 2014 in accordance
with the terms established in the ordinary course of business as of the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ that, to the extent applicable, performance
goals under such Bonus Plans established in the ordinary course of business
will be reasonably adjusted by Parent in good faith to reflect the
consummation of the Transactions. If the Effective Time occurs during or
after December 2014, the Company will be permitted to establish annual bonus
plans for 2015, based upon targets and goals determined

 



36  using comparable methodology and business measurements as used for the 2014
Bonus Plans. In addition, if the Effective Time occurs in the 2015 calendar
year, all Bonus Plans for Company Employees for 2015 will be continued in
accordance with their terms and will be reasonably adjusted by Parent in good
faith to reflect consummation of the Transactions. The Performance Retirement
Contribution Plan will be continued following the Effective Time through
December 31, 2015, and contributions will be made, in accordance with the
terms thereof based on actual performance. Company performance in respect of
calculations made under the Performance Retirement Contribution Plan for
the calendar year 2014 and/or 2015 will be calculated without taking into
account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any expenses or costs
related to restructurings undertaken in anticipation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or any non-recurring charges that would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not occurred.

 

(i) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement will create any
right or obligation which is enforceable by any employee, former employee,
Company Employee or any other Person with respect to any terms or conditions
of employment, including, but not limited to, the benefits and compensation
described in this _Section 5.5(h)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
any amendments to the Companys, the Company Subsidiaries, Parents and the
Surviving Corporations benefit and compensation plans, programs or
arrangements will occur only in accordance with their respective terms and
will be pursuant to action taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation which are independent of the consummation
of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder.

 

(j) _Local Employment Laws_. The Company and Parent shall fully comply with
their information and consultation obligations related to the transaction
towards any employee representative bodies, as per applicable Law, and nothing
in this _Section 5.5_ is intended to abrogate requirements set forth in the
Laws of the jurisdiction in which a Company Employee is employed concerning
employment, compensation or employee benefits.

Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
necessary actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals and expiration or
termination of waiting periods, including the Regulatory Approvals and the
Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will
any Party hereto be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee,
penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Transactions under any contract or
agreement.

 



37 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, provided and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
promptly, (x) but in no event less than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, file any and all required notifications under the HSR Act and (y)
promptly make all the required filings (or, if required by applicable
Governmental Entities, drafts thereof) under any other Regulatory Law with
respect to the Transactions, and use all reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act, (ii) use all reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances or approvals, and expiration or
termination of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third
parties or other Governmental Entities under any other applicable Regulatory
Law in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions (" _Regulatory Consents_ ") and (y) promptly
making all such filings and timely obtaining all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals, (iii) supply to any Governmental Entity as
promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be
requested pursuant to any Law or by any such Governmental Entity, and (iv)
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, shall offer to take,
or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
the Transactions, including taking all such further action as may be necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice,
state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under
Regulatory Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End
Date), including, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or
Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially
delaying the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; _provided_ ,
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will become subject to,
or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Authority to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of
the Company or any of its Affiliates unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in the event
that the Closing occurs. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will cause their
Subsidiaries not to, take or agree to take any action that would be reasonably
likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing including entering into any
transaction, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay any
filings or approvals required under the HSR Act or other applicable Regulatory
Laws.

 



38 (c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_, and subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, will permit counsel for the other Party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written
communications or submissions (aside from Item 4(c) and 4(d) documents and
other comparable materials), and with respect to any such notification,
filing, written communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith
to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with
respect thereto, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and
(z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in Person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed
transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub will cooperate in all respects with each other and will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this  _Section 5.6_ will limit a
Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or
_Section 7.1(c)_ so long as such Party has, prior to such termination,
complied with its obligations under this  _Section 5.6_.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or
regulation will become applicable to the Transactions, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Section 203 of the DGCL, each of the Company and Parent
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



39 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases issued by
Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement will
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, the Company
and Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior
to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and will not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except (a) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange as determined in
the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such release (in which
case such Party will not issue or cause the publication of such press release
or other public announcement without prior consultation with the other Party)
or (b) to bring or defend a claim in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, that the
restrictions in this _Section 5.8_ will not apply to any Company
communication regarding an Alternative Proposal or a Change of Recommendation.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements, arrangements and understandings of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former
directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify (or permit to
be amended, repealed or modified) any such provisions or the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries) in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or
any claim made within such six-year period will continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent will assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, guaranty
and stand surety for, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_ without limit as to time.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators,

 



40  an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred, whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Person
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary of any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, at and after the Effective
Time, Parent will assume the defense of such Action and Parent and
the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such Action.
Parent will not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party unless Parent assumes full responsibility for such
settlement, the settlement grants the Indemnified Party a complete release in
respect of the potential liability relating to the claims underlying such
Action and the terms of such settlement are not in any way detrimental to the
Indemnified Party and such settlement does not contain any admission
detrimental to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will not settle
any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement does
not provide for monetary damages, the terms of such settlement are not in any
way detrimental to Parent and such settlement does not contain any admission
detrimental to Parent.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time,
Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of
the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case
will purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. At
the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time covering, without limitation, the Transactions. If
such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other Party will have any further
obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

 

(d) Parent will pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder will be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ will survive the consummation
of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties. Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with an applicable
standard under applicable Law or under any applicable 

 



41  organizational documents or indemnification agreements, as the case may be,
will be made, at the request of such Indemnified Party, by independent legal
counsel selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to
Parent.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will be entitled to take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and
permitted to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of shares of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations.

Section 5.12 _Share Acquisition Prohibition_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and
Merger Sub will not, directly or indirectly, purchase (or otherwise acquire
beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13d-3) or record
ownership of) any shares of Company Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub will
cause each of their respective Affiliates to comply with this _Section 5.12_
as if each such Affiliate was Parent and was party to this Agreement.

Section 5.13  _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange,
timely obtain, maintain and enforce its rights in respect of the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, and will
not permit any amendment and the requirements set forth above or modification
to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letters if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Financing, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii)
above, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay (other than
a de-minimus delay), impede (other than a de-minimus impediment) or prevent
the Closing Date, (B) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (C)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of consummation of the

 



42  Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (i)
amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) otherwise amend or
replace the Debt Commitment Letters so long as (v) such amendment or
replacement do not impose terms or conditions that would reasonably be
expected to delay, impede or prevent the Closing, (w) the terms are not, taken
as a whole, less beneficial to Parent or Merger Sub, than those in the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement or impose
incremental conditions (or expand existing conditions) to funding thereunder
as compared to the Debt Commitment Letters in effect as of the date hereof (x)
adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Financing agreements as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof or in the
definitive debt agreements, (y) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing and (z) with respect to replacements, the replacement debt
commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative
Financing set forth below. In the event of such amendment or replacement of
the Debt Commitment Letters as permitted by the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the financing under such amended or replaced
Debt Commitment Letters will be deemed to be " _Financing_ " as such term is
used in this Agreement. Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed of
any such amendment, modification, supplement or replacement, including
promptly providing copies of all such drafts and related final documentation.
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (I) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letters (including any definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith), (II) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the Marketing Period) all conditions in the Financing Agreements applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing as promptly as practicable,
(III) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letters on terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters or consistent in all material respects with the Debt Commitment
Letters as promptly as practicable (such definitive agreements, together with
the Debt Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Agreements_ ") and promptly upon
execution thereof provide complete executed copies of such definitive
agreements to the Company, (IV) consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing and (V) fully enforce the counterparties obligations and its rights
under the Financing Agreements, including by suit or other appropriate
proceeding to cause the lenders under the Financing to fund in accordance with
their respective commitments if all conditions to funding the Financing in
the applicable Financing Agreements have been satisfied or waived. Parent will
keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of
Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including, upon Companys reasonable request, (A) advising
and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to
status, proposed Closing Date and terms of the Financing Agreements for the
Financing and (B) providing copies of the current drafts of all such Financing
Agreements. If any portion of that amount of the Financing becomes reasonably
likely to be unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
applicable Financing Agreements, (i) Parent will promptly notify the Company
and (ii) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions not less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than the terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Financing Agreements (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable

 



43  following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of
the Marketing Period. In such event, (1) the term " _Financing_ " will be
deemed to include the Alternative Financing, (2) the term " _Debt Commitment
Letters_ " will be deemed to include any commitment letters, engagement
letters and fee letters with respect to any such alternative debt financing
and (3) the term " _Financing Agreements_ " will be deemed to include any
definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative Financing.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.13_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be
required (i) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (ii)
to consummate the Closing any earlier than the final day of the Marketing
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent will, directly or indirectly, make
all proceeds of the Debt Financing received by Parent available to Merger Sub
as are required for Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) The Company will provide to Parent, and will cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, at Parents cost and expense as provided in  _Section 5.13(c)_, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary and necessary in
connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Financing and
causing the conditions in the Financing Agreements to be satisfied, including
using reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with the preparation of
offering and syndication documents and materials, including prospectuses,
private placement memoranda, information memoranda, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency materials and presentations, and similar
documents and materials, in connection with the Financing (all such documents
and materials, collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "), (ii) preparing
and furnishing to Parent and the Financing Sources promptly with all Required
Information to the extent it is available to the Company and all other
information and disclosures relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including their businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects)
as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist in preparation of the
Offering Documents, (iii) having the Company designate a member of senior
management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the Financing, including
direct contact between such senior management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Parents Financing Sources and potential lenders in the
Financing, (iv) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family
ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, (v) requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with
Parents reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and
consents from the Companys independent auditors, if applicable, (vi)
assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive
financing documents, including guarantee documents, hedging agreements and
other certificates and documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
(vii) obtaining from the Companys existing lenders such consents, approvals,
authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing, (viii) obtaining from the Companys existing
banking lenders customary payoff letters, lien releases, instruments of
termination or discharge and (ix) cooperating with Parent to satisfy the
conditions precedent to the Financing to the extent within the control of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to the Surviving Corporation immediately upon the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any certificate, document, agreement or instrument (other
than the representation letters referred to above) will

 



44  be effective until the Effective Time and, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other liability (other than in connection with the authorization
and representation letters referred to above) in connection with the Financing
prior to the Effective Time. In connection with the foregoing, the Company
will file with the SEC all Company Reports for the annual and quarterly
fiscal periods ending on and after September 30, 2014 not later than (i) 90
days following the end of the Companys fiscal year, in the case of annual
reports on Form 10-K and (ii) 45 days following the end of each fiscal
quarter of the Company, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, all of
which such Company Reports will be Compliant. The Company hereby consents to
the use of the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing in
a form and manner agreed with the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely,
to harm or disparage the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company will, upon
reasonable request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to upon
obtaining knowledge thereof promptly update any Required Information (to the
extent it is available) to be included in any Offering Document to be used in
connection with such Financing so that Parent may ensure that any such
Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading.

(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of  _Section 5.13(b)_, (i) solely
Parent will be responsible for provision of any post-Closing pro forma
financial information, including cost savings, synergies, capitalization,
ownership or other pro forma adjustments ( _provided_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company will provide Parent with customary reasonably
available financial and other information relating to the Company and its

interest or joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques as

managers or partners will be required to take any action pursuant to this 
_Section 5.14_ that would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries.

abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
delivery of the Written Consent:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent if (i) the Effective Time will not
have occurred on or before April 30, 2015 (the " _End Date_ ") and (ii) the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_
will not have breached in any material respect its obligations under this

if, as of the End Date, all conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_
 and _6.3_ will have been satisfied or waived (other than those that are to
be satisfied by action taken at the Closing and other than the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_), then the Company or Parent
can (each in its sole discretion) extend the End Date to May 31, 2015, by
providing written notice to the other Party on or before the End Date, in
which case May 31, 2015 will be the End Date for all purposes under this
Agreement; 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if an injunction will have been entered

of the Merger and such injunction will have become final and non-appealable,
provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)_ will have used its best efforts to remove such injunction;

(d) by the Company or Parent, if the Written Consent has not been delivered to
the Company and Parent within twenty-four (24) hours after the Go-Shop Period
End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) the Company may not exercise this
termination right under this _Section 7.1(d)_ until the day that is the fifth

any force and effect upon receipt of a copy of the Written Consent by the
Company and Parent;

 

(e) by the Company, if Parent will have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date; _provided_ , that
the Company will have given Parent written notice, delivered at least thirty
(30) days prior to such termination, notifying Parent of such breach or

Parent will have given the Company written notice, delivered at least thirty
(30) days prior to such termination, notifying the Company of such breach or

49 (g) by the Company, if the Company Board has (i) concluded in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors,
that in light of a Superior Proposal, it would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law to make the Company Board
Recommendation or to fail to effect a Change of Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent; provided, however, that the Company (i) will have given
Parent written notice (a " _Termination Notice_ ") of its intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_, which notice will
attach the most current unredacted version of the proposed agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal (or if there is no proposed agreement, a
description in reasonable detail of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Superior Proposal (such Person or group of Persons, the " _Change
of Recommendation Party_ ")) and (ii) complied with the provisions of _Section
5.3(g)_.

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1_, this Agreement will terminate (except for the Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in _Section 5.2_, this paragraph and the provisions of _Section
7.2_ and _Article VIII_ ), and there will be no other liability or obligation
on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, to the other except (i) as provided for in the Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) subject, in all respects, to the limitations set forth in
_Section 7.2_, as arising out of the fraud of the Company or a Company
Material Breach, or (iii) as arising out of the fraud of Parent or Merger Sub,
intentional breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or the failure
of Parent or Merger Sub to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the Company or failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform an
agreement or covenant hereof, in which case, Parent or Merger Sub will not be
relieved of any liability to the Company, whether in Law or in equity, as a
result of such failure or breach. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, and subject, in all respects, to the limitations
set forth in _Section 7.2_, (x) the Companys aggregate liability under this
Agreement will not exceed under any circumstances $62,804,683 in the aggregate

circumstances be liable to pay money damages, on the one hand, and the
Termination Fee, the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent

be liable to pay money damages in the event that any of the Termination Fee,
the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses is payable
hereunder.

 

Section 7.2 _Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary:

 

(a) If (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any Alternative
Proposal (substituting 80% for the 25% threshold set forth in the definition
of "Alternative Proposal") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") is publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at or prior to, the
Cut-Off Date, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ and (iii) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months
after such termination, any definitive agreement providing for such Qualifying
Transaction will have been entered into with 

 



50  the Person or group of Persons who proposed such Qualifying Transaction that
was existing at the Cut-Off Date, or any Affiliate thereof, and in any
instance such Qualifying Transaction shall have been consummated, then the
Company will pay to Parent a fee of $62,804,683 (the " _Termination Fee_ ")
less the amount of Parent Expenses payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, if
any, in cash, substantially concurrently with the consummation of such
Qualifying Transaction.

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
7.1(g)_ and (ii) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such
termination, any definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a
Qualifying Transaction will have been entered into with the Person or group
of Persons who made the Superior Proposal that was existing at the time of
such termination, or any Affiliate thereof, and in any instance such
Qualifying Transaction shall have been consummated, then the Company will pay
to Parent a fee of: 

(i) $35,888,391 (less the amount of Parent Expenses, if any, paid pursuant to
this _Section 7.2_) if such termination results from the Companys
consummation of a Qualifying Transaction that was in response to an
Alternative Proposal first received by the Company during the Go-Shop Period
or was otherwise consummated with an Excluded Party; and

 

(ii) $62,804,683 (less the amount of Parent Expenses, if any, paid pursuant to
this _Section 7.2_) if such termination results from the Companys
consummation of a Qualifying Transaction that was in response to an
Alternative Proposal not received by the Company during the Go-Shop Period and
that was not otherwise consummated with an Excluded Party (the amount set
forth in clauses (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, the " _Change of
Recommendation Termination Fee_ ").

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or a
Termination Fee is otherwise payable, the Company will pay within five (5)
Business Days following termination as directed by Parent up to $6,000,000 in
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").

 

(c) In consideration of the payment by the Company of the Termination Fee, the
Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, if and
solely to the extent permitted by this _Section 7.2_, Parent and Merger Sub
unconditionally and irrevocably agree to (and will cause their respective
Affiliates and each of the foregoings respective Representatives to) not
exercise, and waive, any and all claims and rights it or they may have against
the Company and its direct and indirect stockholders relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
Companys Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders and Representatives) will have no further liability to
Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or with respect to transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Parent or its stockholders or Merger Sub,
with such payment to be made substantially concurrently with the consummation
of such Qualifying Transaction. Any such payment will be net of any amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

 



51 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
right of specific performance, if and solely to the extent permitted by
_Section 8.6_, or (ii) the ability of Parent to receive the Termination Fee
or the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses from
the Company, if and solely to the extent permitted by this _Section 7.2_,
will be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at Law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) of Parent and Merger Sub and any other Person
against the Company (or the Companys Affiliates or its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) for any
breach, liability, cost, expense, loss or damage suffered as a result thereof
or in connection with or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and, in the event the Termination Fee or the Change of
Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses are due and payable, if
and solely to the extent permitted by this  _Section 7.2_, upon payment
thereof, the Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives)
will have no further liability or obligation to Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates or any of the foregoings respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders or Representatives. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances will
Parent or Merger Sub together be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a
grant of specific performance, on the one hand, and the Termination Fee or the
Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, on the other
hand, (B) the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee and the Termination
Fee or (C) more than one Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or more than
one Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub seek to recover any money damages other than the
Termination Fee or the Change of Recommendation Termination Fee or the Parent
Expenses (and such Change of Recommendation Termination Fee, Termination Fee
or Parent Expenses will be payable if and solely to the extent it is required
to be paid under this _Section 7.2_).

Section 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will
terminate at the Effective Time, other than (a) the covenants and agreements

permitted to make, and no Party will have any liability or obligation with
respect to, any claims for any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth herein or any covenant or agreement herein that is to have been
performed by another Party on or prior to Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, each Party hereby waives (on behalf of
itself, each of its Affiliates and each of its Representatives), to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (including any statutory rights to contribution or indemnification)
for any breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or obligation to
have been performed prior to Closing set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company (directly or indirectly) or
the subject matter of this Agreement that

 



52  such Party may have against the other Parties hereto or any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any theory whatsoever, under any Law, contract, tort or otherwise.

Section 8.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.2_, whether or not

more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
electronic means or otherwise) to the other parties.

Section 8.4 _Facsimile Signatures_. A signature page to this Agreement, the
agreements referred to herein, and each other agreement or instrument entered
into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, that contains a copy of a

Agreement or any such other document, including a document sent by means of a
facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format
("pdf"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement
or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. Minor
variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from earlier
versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be disregarded in
determining the Partys intent or the effectiveness of such signature. At the
request of any Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other
Party hereto or thereto will re execute original forms thereof and deliver
them to all other parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument will raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic
transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or electronic transmission in pdf as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each such Party forever waives
any such defense.

 

Section 8.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. This Agreement will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of

rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware. In addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will
be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery

 



53  declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto by this Agreement
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.5_, (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

Section 8.6 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will be entitled (in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and
(b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In
circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the
Merger and the Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub
expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company and its stockholders will
have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate the Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf
of itself and its stockholders will be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement. Each
Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person will be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.6_
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 8.7 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 8.7_.

55 or to such other address as any Party will specify by written notice so given,
and such notice will be deemed to have been delivered as of the date so
telecommunicated, personally delivered or mailed. Any Party to this Agreement
may notify any other Party of any changes to the address or any of the other
details specified in this paragraph; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
notification will only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
two (2) Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection
or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of changed
address of which no notice was given will be deemed to be receipt of the
notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. The
failure of any Party to give notice will not relieve any other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that such Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.

Section 8.9  _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 8.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of such term or
provision and the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in
any jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 8.11 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Commitment Letter constitute the entire agreement, and supersede and
cancel all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and, except (a) for the provisions of _Section 2.1(a)_
(which will be for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time), _Section 5.5_ (which will be for the benefit of the
Companys current and former employees), _Section 5.9_ (which will be for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties), _Section 5.13(c)(iv)_ (which will be for
the benefit of the Persons set forth therein) and  _Section 5.2(c)_ (which
will be for the benefit of the Principal Stockholders) and (b) that the
Company will have the right to pursue damages on behalf of its stockholders in
the event of Parents or Merger Subs fraud or breach or wrongful termination
of this Agreement, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for
itself and on behalf of its stockholders will be determined by reference to
the total amount that would have been recoverable by the holders of Company
Common Stock if all such holders brought an action against Parent and Merger
Sub and were recognized as intended third-party beneficiaries hereunder, which
right is hereby acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub, is for the sole benefit
of the parties hereby and their permitted assigns and nothing in this
Agreement is intended to and will not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that the Financing Sources are third party beneficiaries of the
provisions of _Sections 8.5_ and _8.13_.

 



56 Section 8.12 _Disclaimer_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the
sole benefit of such parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
_Section 8.13_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of such parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto (and, as applicable, the Indemnified
Parties) may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.13 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company and Parent, or, in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that
after the Company and Parents receipt of the Written Consent, if any such
amendment or waiver will by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange require further approval of the
stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver
will be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company. No
amendments or modifications in respect of any provisions of which the
Financing Sources are made a third party beneficiary pursuant to _Section
8.11_ will be made without the written consent of the Financing Sources.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. None of the Financing Sources will have any
liability to the Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will
have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

 

Section 8.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement will be deemed to include any
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

Section 8.15 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and will be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 8.16 _Company Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of information in the
Company Disclosure Letter will not be construed as or constitute an admission
or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or
other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor will it
be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such information
is material to the Company. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter (including the
listing of items on any Company

 



57  Disclosure Letter although such items may not necessarily be required to be
included in such Company Disclosure Letter because of the dollar thresholds
set forth in this Agreement). Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Person will use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such item or matter,
or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and no Person will use the fact of setting
forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice for
purposes of this Agreement.

Section 8.17 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference will be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any references in this
Agreement to "dollars" or "$" will be to U.S. dollars. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to in this Agreement means such agreement, instrument or statute as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case
of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. Each of the parties
has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
