the Accounting Firm (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) is closer
to the net amount of the Unresolved Items as submitted to the Accounting Firm
by Buyer than to the net amount of the Unresolved Items as submitted to the
Accounting Firm by the Seller Representatives, then the fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Sellers; and (b) if otherwise, the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer.

2.4.3. Post-Close Adjustments. Promptly, and in any event no later than the

Statement: (a) if the actual Working Capital set forth in the Closing Account

shall pay to Sellers such excess amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds; and (b) if the actual Working Capital set forth in the
Closing Account Statement (as finally determined in accordance with Section
2.4.2) is less than the estimated Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Certificate, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such shortfall
as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 2.4.3.

Statement, and the determination and calculation of Working Capital contained
therein shall be prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the

and exclusions, except that Cash shall only be included in the Working Capital
included in the Closing Account Statement) used and applied by the Company in
the preparation of its audited financial statements as of December 31, 2014,

execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto) is a legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by the availability of equitable remedies.

5.3. Authorization of Governmental Authorities. No action by (including any
authorization, consent or approval), or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority (other than in connection with the HSR Act and
applicable Other Antitrust Laws) is required for, or in connection with, the
valid and lawful authorization, execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by
Buyer.

5.4. Noncontravention. Neither the execution, delivery, and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
will: (a) violate any provision of any Legal Requirement applicable to Buyer;

notice or the lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or the
material loss of a benefit, or material increase in any fee, liability or
obligation under, any material Contractual Obligation of Buyer; or (c) require
any authorization, consent or approval of, or notice to, any Person under any
material Contractual Obligation of Buyer.

5.5. Availability of Funds. Buyer has cash available or has existing committed
borrowing facilities ("Financing") which are sufficient to enable it to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions and the Ancillary Agreements. Copies
of the documents governing any such facilities have been made available to
Sellers prior to the date hereof. The Financing will be available to Buyer on
a timely basis to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and the Ancillary
Agreements, and to Buyer's knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance that
would cause the Financing to be unavailable on such basis. 

5.6. Brokers. Buyer does not have any Liability to pay any fees or commissions
to any broker, finder or similar agent with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the Contemplated Transactions.

to prevent or delay any filings or approvals required under the HSR Act or
applicable Other Antitrust Laws.

5.8. Litigation. Except under the HSR Act and applicable Other Antitrust Laws,
there are no Actions, pending or, to Buyer's knowledge, threatened in writing
against Buyer that: (a) challenges or seeks to enjoin, alter or materially
delay the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions; or (b) would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Contemplated
Transactions.

5.9. Unregistered Securities. Buyer has been advised that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and,
therefore, cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such
registration requirements is available.

5.10. No Resale or Distribution. Buyer is purchasing the Shares to be acquired
hereunder for its own account and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, the distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

5.11. Business Experience. Buyer has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that Buyer is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of such investment, is able to incur a complete loss of such
investment and is able to bear the economic risk of such investment for an
indefinite period of time.

5.12. Accredited Investor. Buyer is an accredited investor as that term is
defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
The cost to bind the DandO Tail Policy shall be a Seller Transaction Expense.

6.3.6. Sellers and Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that from and after the
Closing each of the present and former directors and officers of the Company
and the Subsidiary shall be an express third-party beneficiary of this Section
6.3. The rights of such directors and officers under this Section 6.3 shall be

Seller will cause its representatives and Affiliates not to, at any time on or
after the Effective Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed), disclose or use, any Confidential Information (except in the case
of such disclosure or use of such information in the ordinary course of
performing such Seller's duties for the sole benefit of the Company or the
Subsidiary or at the written request of Buyer and the Company or Subsidiary);
provided, however, that the information subject to the foregoing provisions of
this sentence will not include: (a) any information generally available to, or
known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation
hereof); or (b) any information that becomes available on a non-confidential
basis from a source that is not prohibited from disclosing such information by
any legal, contractual or fiduciary obligations; and provided, further, that
the provisions of this Section 6.4.1 will not prohibit any retention of copies
of records or disclosure: (i) required by any applicable Legal Requirement so
long as reasonable prior notice of such disclosure is given to the Company and
Buyer and a reasonable opportunity is afforded the Company or Buyer to contest
such disclosure; or (ii) made in connection with the enforcement of any right
or remedy relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. 

6.4.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller and its representatives and
Affiliates may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of and strategies relating to the
Contemplated Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or

Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii).

6.5. Publicity. No public announcement or disclosure may be made by any party
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior written consent of both Buyer and the Seller

information disclosed on an approved public announcement pursuant to this
Section 6.5.

6.6. Antitrust Notification.

6.6.1. Buyer, Sellers, and the Company shall in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file
with: (i) the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the notification and report
form required for the Contemplated Transactions and any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which
forms shall specifically request early termination of the waiting period
prescribed by the HSR Act; and (ii) any other Governmental Authority, any
other filings, reports, information, and documentation and, if required, a
draft required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any
applicable Other Antitrust Laws. Buyer shall be responsible for all filing and
other similar fees payable in connection with such filings and any local
counsel fees.

6.6.2. Buyer, Sellers, and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act, and if
applicable, any Other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions and shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from the FTC or DOJ and any other Governmental
Authority and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to undertake
anything, including entering into any transaction, that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay the expiration of the initial waiting period
under the HSR Act or applicable Other Antitrust Laws. 

6.6.3. The Parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act or any applicable Other Antitrust Laws at the
earliest practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and
cooperation include counsel's undertaking: (a) to keep each other
appropriately informed of communications from and to personnel of the FTC or
DOJ and any other Governmental Authority; and (b) to confer with each other
regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such FTC,
DOJ, and any other Governmental Authority. Neither Buyer, Sellers, nor the
Company shall participate in any meeting or discussion with the FTC or DOJ and
any other Governmental Authority with respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
FTC or DOJ and any other Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of either
Buyer, Sellers or the Company shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel
only). Buyer, Sellers, and the Company shall each approve the content of any
presentations, white papers or other written materials to be submitted to the
FTC or DOJ and any Other Governmental Authority in advance of any such
submission.

6.6.4. Without limiting the generality of Buyer's undertaking pursuant to this
Section 6.6, Buyer shall promptly take or cause to be taken reasonable best
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act and, if applicable,
any applicable Other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) related to the HSR Act or any applicable Other
Antitrust Laws that would prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
required to commence or defend any legal proceeding or to divest, dispose of
or hold separate any assets to secure clearance or approval under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law.

6.7. Further Assurances. During the time between the Effective Date and the
Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Buyer or Sellers, each of the
Parties will do, execute, acknowledge, and deliver all such further acts,
assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, and other instruments
and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the
Contemplated Transactions.

6.8. Restrictions on Transfers. Each Seller hereby agrees not to transfer,
assign or pledge, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise,
any of his, her or its Shares (other than the sale of such Shares pursuant to
this Agreement) during the period from the Effective Date through and
including the Closing. The Company hereby agrees not to transfer, assign or
pledge, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, any of the
Company's Equity Interests held in the Subsidiary during the period from the
Effective Date through and including the Closing. Any such attempted transfer,
assignment or pledge during 

such period will not be effective, and Sellers shall cause the Company, or the
Company shall cause the Subsidiary, as the case may be, not to record such
transfer, assignment or pledge in the stock transfer records of the Company or
the Subsidiary, as the case may be.

6.9. Seller Representatives.

6.9.3. Each Seller irrevocably appoints James G. Baxter and Harvey Kimmel (the
"Seller Representatives") with power of designation and assignment as his, her
or its true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents with full power of
substitution, to act solely and exclusively on behalf of, and in the name of,
such Seller with the full power, without the consent of such Seller, to
exercise as the Seller Representatives in their sole discretion deem
appropriate by joint written action, the powers which such Seller could
exercise under the provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Seller
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
which shall include the power and authority to amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and to execute,
deliver, and accept such waivers and consents and any and all notices,
documents, certificates or other papers to be delivered in connection with
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions as the Seller Representatives, in their sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable. The appointment and power of
attorney granted by each Seller to the Seller Representatives shall be deemed
coupled with an interest and all authority conferred hereby shall be
irrevocable whether by death or incapacity of any such Seller or the
occurrence of any other event or events. The Seller Representatives shall keep
the Sellers reasonably informed with respect to any material indemnification
claims or other material developments arising out of their duties pursuant to
this Agreement. The Seller Representatives, in their capacities as such, shall
treat Sellers equally (and not take any action that disproportionately affects
any one Seller) in connection with the administration of their duties under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller Representatives shall
not terminate this Agreement or consent to any material waiver, modification
or amendment to this Agreement without the consent of Sellers who hold not
less than 75% of the Shares immediately prior to Closing.

6.9.4. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Representatives
will not be liable to Sellers for any act done or omitted hereunder as the
Seller Representatives while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel will be conclusive evidence of such good faith. Sellers will severally
and not jointly indemnify the Seller Representatives and hold them harmless
against any Losses incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part
of the Seller Representatives and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of their duties under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) with respect to the
Baxter Affiliates, each Baxter 

Affiliate will be, solely among the Baxter Affiliates, jointly and severally
liable for any monetary indemnification claim pursuant to this Agreement for
which any Baxter Affiliate is responsible; (b) with respect to the Kimmel
Affiliates, each Kimmel Affiliate will be, solely among the Kimmel Affiliates,
jointly and severally liable for any monetary indemnification claim pursuant
to this Agreement for which any Kimmel Affiliate is responsible; and (c) with
respect to the Kleiman Affiliates, each Kleiman Affiliate will be, solely
among the Kleiman Affiliates, jointly and severally liable for any monetary
indemnification claim pursuant to this Agreement for which any Kleiman
Affiliate is responsible.

6.9.5. Sellers will reimburse the Seller Representatives for their pro rata
share, of any out-of-pocket, independent, third-party fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, and other advisors)
incurred by the Seller Representatives that arise out of or are in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Seller Representatives' duties
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If not paid directly by
Sellers to the Seller Representatives, any such amounts may be paid by the
Seller Representatives from the funds available in the Expense Fund; provided,
that while this Section 6.9.3 allows the Seller Representatives to use the
funds available in the Expense Fund, this does not relieve Sellers from their
obligation to promptly reimburse the Seller Representatives for any
reimbursable amounts in excess of the Expense Fund Amount, nor does it prevent
the Seller Representatives from seeking any remedies against Sellers available
to them pursuant to applicable law. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
indemnities provided in Section 6.9 will survive the resignation or removal of
the Seller Representatives or the termination of this Agreement. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Seller Representatives'
responsibilities (as determined by the Seller Representatives in their
reasonable discretion), the Seller Representatives will distribute or will
cause to be distributed the remaining balance of the Expense Fund to each
Seller on a pro rata basis determined as of the Closing Date.

6.9.6. If one of the Seller Representatives dies, becomes incapacitated or
resigns, the other Seller Representative may solely exercise all rights of the
Seller Representatives hereunder. If both of the Seller Representatives die,
become incapacitated or resign, Sellers (including the estates of any deceased
Sellers) shall duly elect two (2) replacement Seller Representatives by vote
of holders of a majority of Shares held prior to Closing.

6.10. Company's 401(k) Plan Termination; IRS Filings. The Company will
terminate the Company's 401(k) Plan effective one (1) day prior to the
Closing, to be contingent on the Closing, in accordance with the provisions of
the Company's 401(k) Plan, and will provide notice of the termination to plan
participants, beneficiaries, the trustee and other appropriate service
providers. Furthermore, as soon as practicable following the Closing, Buyer
will cause the Company (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) to prepare and file
with the IRS an Application for Determination for Terminating Plan on Form
5310, and 

prepare and file all other information required to be submitted in connection
therewith, in accordance with applicable IRS requirements, including
requirements concerning Notices to Interested Parties; provided that if a
submission to the IRS is necessary under the Voluntary Correction with the
Internal Revenue Service Approval Program ("VCP") of the Employee Plan
Compliance Resolution System with respect to the Company's 401(k) Plan, such
submission (including the preparation and filing of all other information
required to be submitted in connection therewith, in accordance with
applicable IRS requirements) will be at the sole cost and expense of the
Seller Representatives. The Company will provide the Seller Representatives
with a reasonable opportunity to review the filings before making such
filings. The Company will cause proper administration of the Company's 401(k)
Plan to continue during the pendency of the IRS determination request, and
will take all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to obtain a
favorable determination letter from the IRS. Upon receipt of a favorable
determination letter, the Company will oversee termination distributions from
the Company's 401(k) Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Company's
401(k) Plan. The Seller Representatives will provide such cooperation and
assistance to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request with respect to foregoing
matters. The Company will perform its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.10 at the Seller Representatives' sole cost and expense, in the Seller
Representatives' capacity as such and on behalf of Sellers.

6.11. Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Buyer maintains a qualified defined contribution
plan with a cash-or-deferred arrangement under Code Section 401(k) (the
"Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). After the Company has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS on the Form 5310 filed as provided in
Section 6.11 of this Agreement, Buyer shall cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to be
amended to permit Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept the rollover of an asset
consisting of a loan to a participant in the Company's 401(k) Plan, but only
if such participant is a current employee of Buyer or the Company and the loan
is not the only asset rolled over to Buyer's 401(k) Plan by such employee.

6.12. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

6.12.19. Non-Competition. For the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), each Seller will not, directly or indirectly, (i) enter into, be
employed by, engage in, consult, manage or otherwise participate in the
operation of any business which competes with the Company, the Subsidiary or
the Business (as conducted by the Company, the Subsidiary or Buyer) within the
Restricted Territory, (ii) solicit customers, business, patronage or orders
for, or sell, any products or services in competition with, or for any
business that competes with, the Company, the Subsidiary or the Business (as
conducted by the Company, the Subsidiary or Buyer) within the Restricted
Territory, (iii) divert, entice or otherwise take away any customers,
business, patronage or orders of the Company, the Subsidiary or Buyer, or
attempt to do so or (iv) promote or assist, financially or otherwise, any
person engaged in any business which competes with the Company, the Subsidiary
or the Business (as conducted by the Company, the Subsidiary or Buyer) within
the 

Restricted Territory. Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 will prohibit any
Seller from acquiring or holding at any one time a passive Investment of less
than two percent (2%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of any
publicly traded corporation that may compete with Buyer within the Restricted
Territory, or engaging in professional services in the ordinary course of
business (such as legal, accounting or investment banking) for clients engaged
in the Business. For purposes of this Section 6.12, Buyer will also include
any Affiliate of Buyer.

6.12.20. Non-Solicitation. During the Restricted Period, each Seller will not,
directly or indirectly, at any time solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or
induce or hire or attempt to hire any employee, sales representative, agent or
consultant of the Company, the Subsidiary, Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates, to terminate their employment, representation or other association
with the Company, the Subsidiary, Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates, without obtaining written consent of Buyer prior to such
solicitation or inducement.

6.12.21. Acknowledgment and Relief. Each Seller acknowledges that (i) its
obligations under this Section 6.12 are reasonable in the context of the
nature of the business conducted by the Company, the Subsidiary and Buyer and
the competitive injuries likely to be sustained by the Company, the Subsidiary
and Buyer if such Seller were to violate such obligations, (ii) the covenants
in this Section 6.12 are adequately supported by consideration from Buyer for
the benefit of Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary after the Closing Date
and (iii) the foregoing makes it necessary and reasonable for the protection
of the Company, the Subsidiary and Buyer that no Seller compete with Buyer,
the Company or the Subsidiary for the Restricted Period contained herein.
Accordingly, each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law
available to the Company, the Subsidiary and Buyer for breach of such Seller's
obligations under this Section 6.12 would be inadequate; therefore, in
addition to any other rights or remedies that Buyer may have at law or in
equity, temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in any Action
which may be brought to enforce any provision contained in this Section 6.12
without the necessity of proof of actual damage. If it is judicially
determined that any Seller has violated this Section 6.12, then the period
applicable to each obligation that such Seller has been determined to have
violated will automatically be extended by a period of time equal in length to
the period during which such violation or violations occurred.

6.12.22. Other Agreements. The obligations and restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.12 are in addition to the provisions of any employment or other
agreement of each Seller that may be entered into from time to time and
addresses the same or similar subject matter covered by this Section 6.12.

6.13. Acquisition Proposals. Neither the Company (on behalf of itself and the
Subsidiary) nor any Seller shall, and neither the Company (on behalf of itself
and the Subsidiary) nor any Seller shall authorize or permit any officer,
director, manager or 

employee of the Company, the Subsidiary or any Seller, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a)
solicit, initiate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal, (b) consider, accept
or enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (c)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. The Seller
Representatives shall promptly advise Buyer orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could lead to any
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the material terms thereof.

6.14. GEPCO International. Effective as of no later than one (1) day prior to
the Closing, the Company shall sell or distribute all of the Equity Interests
the Company holds in the Subsidiary to the Sellers or have completed the
dissolution and liquidation of the Subsidiary.

6.15. Environmental Insurance Policy. On or prior to the Closing, the Company
shall have obtained a binder for a pollution legal liability policy with
respect to the Real Property, with terms no less favorable than those set
forth on EXHIBIT F, with coverage in the amount of no less than $10,000,000
and a deductible no greater than $500,000 (the "Environmental Insurance
Policy"). The cost to bind the Environmental Insurance Policy shall be a
Seller Transaction Expense and is not expected to exceed $150,000.

6.16. Insurance Matters. Prior to the Closing, the Company may assign the
benefit of any current Company "key man" or "buy-sell" insurance policies to
the beneficiary designated therein (or his designee), without any compensation
paid therefor, or shall terminate such policies prior to the Closing.

6.17. BIRT Refund; Life Insurance Refund. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and
agree that (a) following the Closing, the Company may be entitled to a refund
from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to the BIRT (the "BIRT
Refund") and that an estimate of the BIRT Refund will be included in the
Working Capital included in the Closing Account Statement (the "Estimated BIRT
Refund") and (b) the life insurance policies set forth on Schedule 6.17, which
are not assigned by the Company prior to Closing, will be terminated as of the
Closing, the Company may be entitled to a refund of a portion of the amount of
the prepaid premium for such life insurance policies (the "Life Insurance
Refund") and an estimate of the Life Insurance Refund will be included in the
Working Capital included in the Closing Account Statement (the "Estimated Life
Insurance Refund"). If the BIRT Refund is not received by the Company within
twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, or if the amount of the BIRT Refund
received by the Company is less than the amount of the Estimated BIRT Refund,
Buyer and the Seller Representatives will promptly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a joint written instruction authorizing a disbursement from the
Escrow Amount to Buyer in the amount of the BIRT Refund or in the amount equal
to the amount by which the BIRT Refund is less than the Estimated BIRT Refund,
as applicable, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. 

If the amount of the Life Insurance Refund received by the Company is less
than the amount of the Estimated Life Insurance Refund, Buyer and the Seller
Representatives will promptly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction authorizing a disbursement from the Escrow Amount to Buyer
in the amount equal to the amount by which the Life Insurance Refund is less
than the Estimated Life Insurance Refund in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

6.18. Dataroom Disk. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered to
Buyer, on one or more CD-Rom disks, a complete and accurate electronic copy of
the transaction dataroom as of June 12, 2015 (the "Dataroom Disk"). Inclusion
of any item on the Dataroom Disk (or attachment to a Disclosure Schedule)
shall constitute "delivery" or "making available" within the meaning of this
Agreement.

6.19. Compliance Matters. From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company

with Environmental Laws, (b) remediate the Hazardous Substances identified

the damaged asbestos-containing materials identified in the Vertex Report
dated June 10, 2015, in each case, as further described in Schedule 6.19, and
to the extent required by applicable Environmental Laws and as necessary to
achieve the Applicable Standard ("Environmental Undertakings"). Prior to the
Closing, the Company will provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
that the Environmental Undertakings have been cured, remediated or abated, in
each case, in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws. To the extent
that the Environmental Undertakings have not been cured, remediated or abated
prior to the Closing, a reasonable estimate mutually acceptable to Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Seller Representatives, on the other hand, of the
remaining costs and expenses to be incurred by the Company or Buyer at or
following the Closing in connection with the Environmental Undertakings shall
be included as current liabilities for purposes of the calculation of Working
Capital as of the Closing to the extent that the Company or Buyer would not
receive coverage (without giving effect to the insurance policy deductible) as
a result of a claim properly asserted under the Environmental Insurance
Policy. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cooperate with Sellers and execute any
documentation that is necessary to achieve the Applicable Standard, including
any documentation associated with engineering or institutional controls and
(ii) cause the Company to timely make and pursue all claims under the
Environmental Insurance Policy with respect to the Environmental Undertakings.

6.20. Oil Tank. Within ten (10) business days after the date hereof, the
Company shall obtain a qualified contractor quote to convert the Company
premises from oil heat to natural gas heat (the "Conversion Cost Estimate")
and provide such information to Buyer. Unless Buyer notifies Seller
Representatives in writing that it prefers to convert the premises to natural
gas, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the
6,000-gallon oil tank to operational condition. In the event (i) Buyer elects
conversion to natural gas or (ii) such tank is not restored to operational
condition prior to the Closing, an amount equal to the Conversion Cost
Estimate shall be included as a current liability for 

purposes of the calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing and Buyer
shall thereafter be responsible for the restoration of heat to the Company
premises, including all costs relating thereto.

eighteen (18)-month period following the Closing Date, with respect to any of
the matters set forth on Schedule 9.1.1(f);

(g) to the extent incurred or suffered by Buyer Indemnified Persons, or any of
them, at any time during the eighteen (18)-month period following the Closing
Date, to the extent not covered by the Company's workers' compensation
insurance, any exposure by any Company employee or former employee to any
asbestos-containing materials prior to the Closing; 

(h) to the extent incurred or suffered by Buyer Indemnified Persons, or any of

Environmental Law or a Pennsylvania Act 2 and recycling program closure to

9.1.8. Limitation to Several Indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

9.1.9. Monetary Limitations. Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.1.1(a) or Section 9.1.1(c)
unless (a) any breach or inaccuracy results in individual Losses (or a series
of related Losses) of $50,000 or more and (b) the aggregate amount of all such
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons exceeds
$1,000,000 less any Environmental Deductible Setoff (at which point Sellers

claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1(a), Section 9.1.1(c),
Section 9.1.1(f), Section 9.1.1(g), Section 9.1.1(h) and Section 9.1.1(i)

inaccuracies in, representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1
(Organization and Good Standing), 3.2 (Power and Authorization), 3.5
(Capitalization), 3.15 (Taxes), 3.24 (No Brokers), 4.1 (Power and

liability for Losses in respect of all claims for indemnification 

pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price
received by such Seller.

9.1.10. Other Limitations.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 9 and any Taxes for which indemnification is provided under Section
10.3 shall be calculated net of any duplicative amounts actually recovered by
any Buyer Indemnified Persons under insurance policies or from third Persons
with respect to such Losses. In addition, Sellers shall not be obligated to
indemnify Buyer with respect to: (i) any covenant or condition waived in
writing by Buyer on or prior to the Closing; or (ii) any Loss with respect to
any matter to the extent that the amount of such Loss was actually reflected
in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant
to Section 2.4.

(b) For purposes of this Section 9, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and the amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, will
be determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
other similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers will have no
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any Loss to any
Buyer Indemnified Person in connection with or as a result of a claim for such
Loss under the Environmental Insurance Policy that is covered thereunder or
would be covered thereunder but for (i) the Environmental Insurance Policy
deductible or cap or (ii) any voluntary act of the Buyer that caused an
otherwise covered claim to be excluded from coverage under the Environmental
Insurance Policy From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company to timely make and pursue all claims
under the Environmental Insurance Policy with respect to Losses for which
Sellers would otherwise have an indemnification obligation in this Agreement.

9.2. Indemnification by Buyer with respect to Sellers.

9.2.2. Indemnification. Without duplication of any other rights to recovery
herein and subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.2, from and
after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, each
Seller's Affiliates, and the representatives and Affiliates of each of the
foregoing Persons (each, a "Seller Indemnified Person"), from, against, and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified
Persons or any of them as a result of, arising out of or directly or
indirectly relating to: 

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty concerning
or made by or on behalf of Buyer in this Agreement, provided such breach or
inaccuracy results in Losses of $50,000 or more;

(b) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of Buyer (including
under this Section 9.2) in or pursuant to this Agreement; and

(c) any fraud or criminal activity by Buyer (or any representative or
Affiliate thereof).

9.3. Time for Claims. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing; provided, that no claim may be made or
suit instituted seeking indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.1.1(a), 9.1.2
or 9.2.1(a) for any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty unless a written notice describing such breach or inaccuracy in
reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to the Indemnified
Party, is provided to the Indemnifying Party:

9.3.5. at any time within six (6) years of the Closing Date, in the case of
any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any Fundamental Representation; and

9.3.6. at any time within eighteen (18) months of the Closing Date, in the
case of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any other representation or warranty
in this Agreement.

9.4. Third Party Claims.

9.4.3. Notice of Claim. If any third party notifies an Indemnified Party with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") that may give rise to an
Indemnity Claim against an Indemnifying Party under this Section 9, then the
Indemnified Party will promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Party,
together with a copy of the document asserting such claim, if any; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
under this Section 9, except to the extent such delay actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

9.4.4. Assumption of Defense. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.4.1. In addition,
the Indemnifying Party will have the right to control the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as: (a) the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from
and against the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Party may
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the Third Party Claim; (b) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party 

with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial resources to defend against
the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder;
(c) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (d) the
Indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel that a conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
the defense of the Third Party Claim; (e) the Third Party Claim does not
relate to or otherwise arise in connection with Taxes or any criminal or
regulatory enforcement Action; (f) settlement of, an adverse judgment with
respect to, or the Indemnifying Party's conduct of the defense of the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party,
likely to be materially adverse to the Indemnified Party's reputation or
continuing business interests (including its relationships with current or
potential customers, suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its
business); and (g) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim actively and diligently. The Indemnified Party may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of separate co-counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party that are incurred prior to Indemnifying Party's assumption
of control of the defense of the Third Party Claim.

9.4.5. Limitations on Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party unless such judgment, compromise or
settlement: (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as
sole relief for the claimant; (b) results in the full and general release of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable,
from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third
Party Claim; and (c) involves no finding or admission of any violation of
Legal Requirements or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other
claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party.

9.5. Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Other than with respect to Sections 6.4, 6.5,
6.8, 6.12, and 6.13 with respect to which Buyer will be entitled to specific
performance, each of the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, after the
Closing, such Party's sole and exclusive monetary remedy with respect to any
of the matters described in this Section 9 and any and all other claims
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and the Contemplated Transactions and thereby shall be in accordance with, and
limited by, the provisions set forth in this Section 9.

9.6. No Other Representations or Warranties. Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that no Party to this Agreement has made nor is it making hereby
any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement, express or implied, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, no Seller nor the 

Company has made or hereby makes any representation or warranty with respect
to any information provided to Buyer or potential providers of financing which
is or was forward-looking in nature, including projections or budgets with
respect to the business of the Company or the Subsidiary, future sales or
profits, expected market conditions or projections, prospective operations,
expected actions of competitors or future business strategies and the expected
results thereof.

9.7. Tax Treatment. Buyer and Sellers agree to treat any indemnification
payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Neither
Buyer nor any Seller shall take any position on any Tax Return, or before any
Governmental Authority involved in the administration of Tax Legal
Requirements, that is inconsistent with such treatment unless otherwise
required by an applicable Legal Requirement.

9.8. Manner of Payment; Escrow. For as long as there are funds in the escrow
account maintained pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, any and all amounts
payable by Sellers as Indemnifying Party to a Buyer Indemnified Person will be
paid in cash first out of such escrow account established pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, and thereafter directly by Sellers in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

9.9. No Consequential Damages. For the avoidance of doubt, Losses shall not
include consequential, special, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages,
contingent lost profits, contingent lost business opportunity, diminution in
value, or any damage based on any type of multiple (including a multiple of
earnings or revenues), in each case, except to the extent such Losses are
awarded to a third party.

9.10. Supplementary Schedules.

9.10.13. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9, the Seller
Representatives shall promptly notify Buyer (i) if the Company, the Subsidiary
or any Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of Sellers' representations and warranties, or if
the Company, the Subsidiary or any Seller becomes aware of the occurrence of
any information, event, fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement), with the passage of time or occurrence of an
event or both, cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or
warranty had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of
occurrence or discovery of such information, event, fact or condition and (ii)
of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of the Company or any Seller
in this Agreement.

9.10.14. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9, Buyer shall promptly
notify the Seller Representatives if Buyer becomes aware of any information,
event, fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Buyer's
representations and warranties, or if Buyer becomes aware of the occurrence of
any information, event, fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this 

Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty
had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such information, event, fact or condition. Between the Effective
and the Closing, Buyer will also promptly notify the Seller Representatives of
the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Buyer in this Agreement.

9.10.15. The Seller Representatives shall have the right to update the
Schedules to this Agreement only with respect to any matter arising after the
date hereof but prior to the Closing that would result in the condition set
forth in Section 7.2.1 not being satisfied, provided that the Seller
Representatives acknowledge concurrently with the delivery of such schedules
that the matter would result in such condition not being satisfied (the
"Supplementary Schedules"). If Buyer receives Supplementary Schedules from the
Seller Representatives, Buyer shall have the right to (i) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.3 or (ii) proceed with the Closing, provided
that upon the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all claims,
including all indemnity claims pursuant to Section 9, for all matters set
forth in the Supplementary Schedules. For all other purposes under this
Agreement, the Supplementary Schedules shall be deemed to supersede and amend
the original Schedules to this Agreement dated as of the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Supplementary Schedule shall contain any matter that
existed as of the date hereof, whether or not known to any Seller or the
Company.

9.11. Counsel. In any proceeding by or against any Seller wherein any Buyer
Indemnified Person asserts or prosecutes any claim under, or otherwise seeks
to enforce, this Agreement, Buyer and the Company each agrees in connection
with such proceeding: (a) that no Buyer Indemnified Person or counsel therefor
will move to seek disqualification of Morgan Lewis; (b) to waive any right any
Buyer Indemnified Person may have to assert the attorney-client privilege
against Morgan Lewis or the Seller Representatives or any of their Affiliates
with respect to any communication or information contained in Morgan Lewis's
possession or files; and (c) to consent to the representation of the Seller
Representatives, any Seller, and any of their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") by Morgan Lewis in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, notwithstanding Morgan
Lewis has or may have represented the Company or any member of the Seller
Group as counsel in connection with any matter, including any transaction
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), negotiation,
investigation, proceeding or action, prior to the Closing. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates that this
consent and waiver extends, without limitation, to Morgan Lewis representing
the Seller Representatives against Buyer, the Company or any Buyer Indemnified
Person in litigation, arbitration or mediation in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. 

10. TAX MATTERS.

10.1. Subchapter "S" Tax Treatment. Sellers shall not revoke the Company's
election to be taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Section 1361
and 1362 of the Code. Sellers shall not take or allow any action (other than
the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement) that would result in the
termination of the Company's status as a validly electing S corporation for
purposes of applicable Tax Legal Requirements.

10.2. Section 338(h)(10) Election. At Buyer's request, Sellers shall join
with Buyer in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding election under state, local, and foreign Tax Legal Requirement)
with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder (collectively,
the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). In furtherance of the preceding sentence,
Sellers shall execute and deliver to Buyer such documents or forms as Buyer
shall reasonably request or as are required by applicable Legal Requirement to
effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers shall include any income,
gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election on their Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, and shall take no position inconsistent with treating the
purchase by Buyer of the Shares as a transaction to which Section 338(h)(10)
applies. The consideration paid for the Shares hereunder and the liabilities
of the Company shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in
accordance with their fair market values determined using the methodology set
forth on EXHIBIT E (the "Allocation Schedule") and Section 338 of the Code.
Buyer, Sellers and each of their Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with such Allocation Schedule, and none of the parties will
voluntarily take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule in any
Action, inquiry, assessment, proceeding or other similar event relating to
Taxes or that would otherwise prejudice the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Any
disagreement over allocation of consideration among the assets in accordance
with the methodology set forth on the Allocation Schedule shall be settled by
the Independent Accountant in accordance with the dispute procedures set forth
in Section 2.4.2; provided that the fees, costs, and expenses of the
Independent Accountant will be apportioned between Sellers, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other, based upon the relative difference between the
Independent Accountant's resolution of the disputed items jointly submitted by
the Seller Representatives (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer and the respective
positions of the Seller Representatives (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer in
respect thereof. Buyer and the Seller Representatives shall, not later than
forty-five (45) days after the final determination of any payment required by
this Section, jointly agree upon any additional allocations to be reflected on
IRS Form 8883. If they cannot so agree, the additional allocations shall be
determined by the Independent Accountant in accordance with the dispute
procedures set forth in Section 2.4.2; provided that the fees, costs, and
expenses of the Independent Accountant will be apportioned between Sellers, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, based upon the relative difference
between the Independent Accountant's resolution of the disputed items jointly
submitted by the Seller Representatives (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer and
the respective positions of the Seller Representatives (on behalf of Sellers)
and Buyer in respect thereof. 

10.3. Indemnification. Without duplication of any other rights to recovery
herein, Sellers shall severally and not jointly indemnify, defend, save, and
hold harmless Buyer (and, following the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiaries) from any Losses attributable to: (a) all Taxes (or the
nonpayment thereof) of the Company or the Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (b) all Taxes under Sections 1374 or 1375 of the Code for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period; (c) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group, if any, of which the Company or the
Subsidiary (or any predecessor or current or former Affiliate of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law); (d) any and all Taxes of any Person
(other than the Company or the Subsidiary) imposed on the Company or the
Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by Contractual Obligation, Legal
Requirement or otherwise, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring on or before the Closing; and (e) any and all Straddle Period Taxes
allocable to Company or the Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, Sellers shall not be liable to
Buyer for any Taxes with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period (including any
Losses or Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period that would be
related to a failure of the parties to make a valid election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code).

10.4. Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiary based upon or measured by income,
gain, or receipts, and any withholding Taxes, for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
will be determined (a) in accordance with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and
(b) based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership
or other pass-through entity in which such the Company or the Subsidiary holds
a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such time). The amount of
Taxes other than withholding Taxes and Taxes based upon or measured by income,
gain or receipts for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period ending on and including the Closing and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

10.5. Certain Taxes and Fees. Sellers and Buyer shall each be responsible for
half of all transfer, documentary, sales, use stamp, registration, and other
such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges ("Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, Sellers, the Company and
the Subsidiary will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Sellers will be responsible for half of the reasonable costs
associated with the preparation of Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes.

10.6. Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, the Company, and Sellers will
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party,
in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company or the Subsidiary
(including by the provision of reasonably relevant records, information or
forms). 

10.7. Returns. Sellers will prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared
and filed) all Tax Returns for income Taxes for the Company for taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, on a basis consistent with the
most recent Tax Returns of the company unless Sellers determine that there is
no reasonable basis for such position. Not later than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date (with extensions) for filing of such Tax Returns, Sellers will
provide Buyer with a copy of such Tax Returns and will allow Buyer an
opportunity to provide comments on such Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for
the Company or the Subsidiary that are to be filed as of and after the Closing
Date in accordance with applicable Tax Legal Requirements; provided that any
Tax Returns filed for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be subject to prior
review and comment of the Seller Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt,
any deduction or other Tax benefit item related to the payment of any Seller
Transaction Expenses or any services compensation payable by virtue of the
Contemplated Transactions shall be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

10.8. Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements and any powers of attorney with respect to or involving the Company
or the Subsidiary shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date.

10.9. Tax Certificates. Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use
their reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions).

10.10. Tax Refunds. If Buyer or the Company receives a refund of Taxes with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that was not included in the calculation
of Working capital, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of such Tax
refund to Sellers within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, provided
that: (i) such Taxes were actually paid by the company; (ii) such Tax refund
is actually received by Buyer or the Company after the Closing; and (iii) such
Tax refund does not arise as the result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax
benefit from a Post-Closing Tax Period. In the event Buyer or the Company
actually repays some or all of a Tax refund to a Governmental Authority,
Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, the amount of such repayment to Buyer
or the Company within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice from Buyer or
the Company or such repayment.

10.11. Additional Restrictions for Pre-Closing Tax Period, Tax Returns, and
Associated Taxes. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representatives (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), file, re-file or amend, or permit the Company to
file, re-file or amend, any Tax Return of the Company that was due on or prior
to the Closing Date, or enter or permit the Company to enter into discussions
regarding any voluntary disclosure involving Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Any disagreement with respect to this Section 10.11 or any amount due
from Sellers to Buyer with respect to any amended tax return filed without
written 

consent of the Seller Representatives shall be settled by the Accounting Firm
in accordance with the dispute procedures set forth in Section 2.4.2.

immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which successors and permitted assigns will be

the Parties and their permitted successors and assignees and nothing herein
expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any Person, other than
the Parties and such successors and assignees, any legal or equitable rights

11.3. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement will be binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of
an amendment, by Buyer, the Company and the Seller Representatives, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
waiver of any breach, violation or default under, or inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder will be deemed to extend to any
prior or subsequent breach, violation, default or inaccuracy or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power
or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.

11.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any documents,
instruments, and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the

The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement are a part hereof as if
fully set forth herein.

11.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

the same instrument. This Agreement will become effective when duly executed
by each party hereto.

11.6. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each
party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or
limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible
with, and possible under, applicable law.

11.7. Construction; Headings. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein will have independent
significance. Any references to "including" in this Agreement shall be deemed
to refer to "including without limitation." The headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience purposes only and will not in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation hereof.

11.8. Governing Law. This Agreement, the rights of the parties and all Actions
arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State of
Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Contemplated Transactions and each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or proceeding
related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in
any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the Parties hereby
consents to process being served by any Party in any suit, action or
proceeding by the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 11.8. 

11.9. Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY, AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, WHICH WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY
A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.
