14 II. THE MERGERS

2.1 _The Mergers_. On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the
parties specified therein will effect the Mergers in accordance with the Plan
of Merger.

2.2 _Merger Consideration_. At the Closing:

(a) Parent will, or will cause the HPC Surviving Corporation to, pay and
deliver for distribution to the holders of common stock of HPC Holdco (" _HPC
Holdco Common Stock_ ") an aggregate amount equal to $2,178,800,000 in cash
and 19,693,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Gross HPC Merger
Consideration_ "), such consideration to be remitted and delivered as
provided in Section 2.3; and

(b) Parent will, or will cause the Hassie Surviving Corporation to, pay
and deliver for distribution to the holder of Hassie Common Stock an
aggregate amount equal to $421,200,000 in cash and 3,807,000 shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Gross Hassie Merger Consideration_ "), such consideration
to be remitted and delivered as provided in Section 2.3.

2.3 _Mechanics of Payment_. (a) Prior to remitting the Gross HPC Merger
Consideration or the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration to the Stockholders of,
respectively, HPC Holdco and Hassie, the cash portions thereof will be reduced
by the amount of the OandG Roll-Up Price and the HPC Deal Costs (in the case
of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration) and the Hassie Deal Costs (in the case
of the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration), which will be paid at Closing by
the Parent or the Surviving Corporations at the direction of SellersÂ’
Representative and for the account of HPC and Hassie to the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the Other Hunt Entities Agreement and the HPC-
Hassie Process Agreement. Such determination will be as set forth in a closing
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") delivered by HPC to Parent not later
than the Business Day prior to Closing, whereupon without further action, (i)
the cash portion of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration will be reduced by an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the OandG Roll-Up Price and the HPC
Deal Costs and (ii) the cash portion of the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration
will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the Hassie Deal Costs. The
Gross HPC Merger Consideration and the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration, as
so reduced, are hereafter referred to, respectively, as the " _Net HPC Merger
Consideration_ " and the " _Net Hassie Merger Consideration_." None of Parent
or the Hunt Entities will have any liability or obligation in respect of the
reduction of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or the Gross Hassie Merger
Consideration, the distribution thereof or any other matters based upon or
related to the Other Hunt Entities Agreement or the HPC-Hassie Process
Agreement.

(b) Following the reductions contemplated by Section 2.3(a), at the Closing: 



 

15 (i) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporations to pay, by bank wire transfer
of immediately available funds to accounts designated for such purpose by
SellersÂ’ Representative, the amount of the OandG Roll-Up Price (less the
Transaction Holdback Amount, if any), the HPC Deal Costs and the Hassie Deal
Costs as set forth in the Closing Statement as aforesaid;

(ii) Subject to Section 2.3(c), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporations
to (A) pay to the holders of HPC Holdco Common Stock, by bank wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the cash portion of the Net
HPC Merger Consideration and (B) issue and deliver to the holders of HPC
Holdco Common Stock the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising a portion of
the Net HPC Merger Consideration;

(iii) Subject to Section 2.3(c), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporations
to (A) pay to the holder of Hassie Common Stock, by bank wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the cash portion of the Net
Hassie Merger Consideration and (B) issue and deliver to the holder of Hassie
Common Stock the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising a portion of the Net
Hassie Merger Consideration;

(iv) The cash portion of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration will be decreased
by the amount by which the aggregate Title Defect Amount exceeds the
Aggregate Title Deductible, if any, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate Title Defect Amount for all Title Defects which are
attributable to Reserve Report Interests owned by HPC and its Subsidiaries,
and the denominator of which is the aggregate Title Defect Amount for all
Title Defects;

(v) The cash portion of the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the amount by which the aggregate Title Defect Amount exceeds the
Aggregate Title Deductible, if any, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate Title Defect Amount for all Title Defects which are
attributable to Reserve Report Interests owned by the Hassie Companies, and
the denominator of which is the aggregate Title Defect Amount for all Title
Defects;

(vi) The cash portion of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration will be decreased
by the amount by which the aggregate Environmental Remediation Amount exceeds
the Aggregate Environmental Deductible, if any, multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the aggregate Environmental Remediation Amount for all
Environmental Defects which are attributable to Reserve Report Interests
owned by HPC and its Subsidiaries, and the denominator of which is the
aggregate Environmental Remediation Amount for all Environmental Defects;

(vii) The cash portion of the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the amount by which the aggregate Environmental  



 

16  Remediation Amount exceeds the Aggregate Environmental Deductible, if any,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate
Environmental Remediation Amount for all Environmental Defects which are
attributable to Reserve Report Interests owned by the Hassie Companies, and
the denominator of which is the aggregate Environmental Remediation Amount for
all Environmental Defects; 

(viii) The cash portion of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of the
payments related to the items set forth on Section 2.3(b)(vi) of the
Disclosure Schedule exceed $232,000,000, such excess amount multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is Gross HPC Merger Consideration and
the denominator of which is the Gross Merger Consideration;

(ix) The cash portion of the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of the payments
related to the items set forth on Section 2.3(b)(vi) of the Disclosure
Schedule exceed $232,000,000, such excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is Gross Hassie Merger Consideration and the denominator
of which is the Gross Merger Consideration; and

(x) The cash portion of the Gross HPC Merger Consideration will be decreased
by the amount, if any, by which any cash dividend paid by HPC or HPC Holdco to
its stockholders exceeds $30,000,000, and the cash portion of the Gross Hassie
Merger Consideration will be decreased by the amount of any cash dividend
paid by the Hassie Companies or Hassie to their stockholder.

(c) ParentÂ’s obligation under Section 2.3(b) will be conditioned on its
receipt, at or prior to the Closing, of stock certificates representing shares
of HPC Holdco Common Stock or Hassie Common Stock, as the case may be,
accompanied by duly executed Letters of Transmittal. Payment of such amounts
will be made to the accounts specified in the relevant Letter of Transmittal.
The amount to be paid to each Stockholder will be determined by dividing the
Net HPC Merger Consideration and the Net Hassie Merger Consideration by the
Number of Outstanding HPC Holdco Shares and the Number of Outstanding Hassie
Shares, as applicable, and multiplying such amount by the number of shares
represented by each share certificate duly delivered to Parent as herein
contemplated. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Number of Outstanding HPC
Holdco Shares_ " equals 1,268 and the " _Number of Outstanding Hassie Shares_
" equals 100,000, provided, however, that, upon notice given by the SellersÂ’
Representative to Parent prior to the Closing, such numbers will be equitably
adjusted to reflect any stock dividend, split, recapitalization or other
change in the capitalization of HPC, HPC Holdco or Hassie, as the case may
be.

(d) In addition to the payments contemplated in Section 2.3(b), at the
Closing, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporations to pay:



 

17 (i) the Transaction Holdback Amount, if any, as set forth in the Closing
Statement, to accounts designated for such purpose by HPC;

(ii) the amounts due under the credit facilities specified in Section 2.3 of
the Disclosure Schedule, as set forth in the Closing Statement; and

(iii) the payments contemplated by Sections 6.7(a)-(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule, as set forth in the Closing Statement.

2.4 _Closing Matters_. (a) The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 2727 North Harwood Street,
Dallas, Texas, (i) on September 3, 2008, if all conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied or waived at or immediately
prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the
waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived as of September 3,
2008 or (ii) if all such conditions are not satisfied or waived as of
September 3, 2008, on a date agreed to by HPC and Parent, which date will be

(other than those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement are to be satisfied or waived at or immediately prior to
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver
of such conditions), or (iii) at such other location, date and time as the
parties may agree. At the Closing, the parties specified in the Plan of Merger
will take or cause to be taken the actions therein specified and Section
2.4(b) and Section 2.4(c) will apply. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

(b) _Closing Deliveries by the Hunt Entities_. At the Closing, the appropriate
Hunt Entity, will deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent the following:

(i) _Pre-Closing Transactions_. Evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that
each of the Internal Reorganizations has been completed, in each instance on

18 (i) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to Section 2.3, evidence of wire
transfers and deliveries, as the case may be, of the OandG Roll-Up Price, the
HPC Deal Costs, the Hassie Deal Costs, the Net HPC Merger Consideration, the
Net Hassie Merger Consideration and the amounts to be paid pursuant to Section
2.3(d); 

(ii) _Officer Â’s Certificate_. A certificate, dated as of the Closing Date,
duly executed on behalf of Parent and each Merger Sub in the form described
in Section 7.3(c); and

(iii) _Indemnification Agreement_. The Indemnification Agreement, duly
executed on behalf of Parent.

2.7. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
split-up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to,
or rights issued in respect of, Parent Common Stock, the stock portions of
the Gross HPC Merger Consideration and the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration
will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the Stockholders the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

HPC AND THE HASSIE COMPANIES

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, HPC and the Hassie Companies,
as applicable, hereby represent and warrant to Parent and the Merger Subs as

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and will have the requisite

HHEC and HHPC is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its Business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case
of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 _Governing Documents_. Copies of the Governing Documents of each of HPC,
HHEC and HHPC and each Subsidiary of HPC set forth on Section 3.6(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, as amended through the date on which this Agreement was

Entities of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby has
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of
HPC, HHEC and HHPC and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of HPC,
HHEC or HHPC are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement

assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and the
Merger Subs, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
HPC, HHEC and HHPC, enforceable against each of HPC, HHEC and HHPC in

or relating to the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and the
application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether that
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) (such
exception, the " _Bankruptcy Exception_ ").

(b) The stockholders of HPC and Hassie have unanimously approved the adoption
of this Agreement and each such stockholder has irrevocably waived all rights

transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) conflict with or
result in a violation of any provision of any of the Hunt EntitiesÂ’ Governing
Documents, (b) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of, or
constitute (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or

acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or other assets of any Hunt

referred to in Section 3.5, violate any applicable Law binding upon any Hunt
Entity, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for any
such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, losses, creations or impositions of Liens that
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 _Required Government Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing, a " _Consent_ ") any Governmental Entity is required on the
part of any Hunt Entity in  



 

20  connection with the execution, delivery by HPC, HHEC and HHPC, respectively,
of this Agreement and the consummation by the Hunt Entities of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) the filing and recordation of
the Certificates of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and such
filings with Governmental Entities as are necessary to satisfy the applicable
Laws of jurisdictions in which the Hunt Entities or HPCÂ’s Subsidiaries are
qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, (c) Consents from the
Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform of the United Kingdom
(" _DBERR_ "), and (d) such other Consents the failure of which to obtain

3.6 _Subsidiaries_. (a) Section 3.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of the name, jurisdiction of organization,
authorized and outstanding capitalization and schedule of stockholders of each
Subsidiary of HPC, giving effect to the Internal Reorganizations. Neither HHEC

other than Permitted Liens and free of any other restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or
voting interest.

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of any Subsidiary of HPC

interest in, such Subsidiary, (iii) obligations of any Subsidiary of HPC, to
grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible

of the Hunt Entities, are referred to collectively as " _Hunt Securities_ ").
There are no outstanding agreements of any kind that obligate any Hunt Entity

Each of HPC, HHEC and HHPC holds, to the extent legally required, all Permits
that are required for the lawful operation of its Business as now conducted,
except where the failure to hold any such Permit would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a  



 

24  Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any default under any
such Permit, nor will one result from the execution of this Agreement or

HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC. There are no disputes pending, or claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of

HPC, the Subsidiary of HPC or the Hassie Company party thereto has performed
all material obligations and is not in breach or default under any Material
Contract, other than those breaches or defaults that would not have,

real or personal property, any existing event of default or event which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by HPC, HHEC,
HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC.

(b) HPC has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of the oil and

of which have been included in the VDR, except for such of  



 

27  the foregoing as to which disclosure is prohibited by confidentiality
obligations owed to third parties), except to the extent that the failure to

current policies of insurance owned or held by or maintained for the benefit
of HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC. Such policies are in full force

severance pay, or any other payment from any Hunt Entity or any Subsidiary
of HPC pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan, (B) accelerate the time of
distribution, payment or vesting, increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due any such employee, director or officer, or result in the
forgiveness of indebtedness for any such employee, director, or officer, or
(C) trigger an obligation to fund benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan;

(ix) No payment or benefit which will or may be made by any Hunt Entity or any
Subsidiary of HPC with respect to any current or former employee or any other
"disqualified individual," as such term is defined under Code Section

(c) Parent has established and maintains, adheres to and enforces a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECÂ’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to ParentÂ’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act
with respect to Parent SEC Reports.

(e) Neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, ParentÂ’s certified
public accounting firm, has identified or been made aware of (i) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to

summarize and report financial information, in each case which has not been
subsequently remediated, or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves ParentÂ’s management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal controls over financial
reporting utilized by Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(f) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").
Each required material form, report and document containing financial
statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC since January 1,
2005 was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted
by ParentÂ’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification complied in all material respects with the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries
to consummate the Mergers or to prepare, file and maintain the effectiveness
of the Shelf Registration Statement for the benefit of the Stockholders or
maintain the listing of the Parent Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange.

financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of HPC,
HHEC, HHPC and HPCÂ’s Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in
this Section 6.10 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.10 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative) of HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC will be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 6.10 by HPC, HHEC or HHPC, as appropriate.

6.11 _Names_. As promptly as practicable and in any event within 180 calendar
days following the Closing, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporations and
each of its other controlled Affiliates to discontinue use of the names "Hunt"
and "Hassie Hunt" (the " _Names_ "), including by amending Governing
Documents, signage, correspondence and other documents and taking all such
other action as may be reasonably required to cease any use or reference
thereto, other than solely as a historical matter. The parties hereby
acknowledge that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will obtain any
direct or indirect ownership interest in or right to use the Names by reason
of the Mergers or otherwise.

6.12 _Title Matters_. (a) Without limiting ParentÂ’s remedies for Title
Defects set forth in this Section 6.12, none of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any
Subsidiary of HPC makes any warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to its title to any of the Oil and Gas
Interests and Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that its sole remedy for
any defect of title, including any Title Defect, is set forth in this Section
6.12.

(b) For the 60-day period after execution of this Agreement, Parent may
conduct, at its sole cost, such title examination or investigation, and other
examinations and investigations, as it may in its sole discretion choose to
conduct with respect to the Reserve Report Interests in order to determine
whether HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, hold Good
and Defensible Title to the Reserve Report Interests. On or before 60 days
after execution of this Agreement (the " _Title Claim Date_ "), Parent must
deliver claim notices to HPC meeting the requirements of this Section 6.12(b)
(collectively, the " _Title Defect Notices_ " and individually, a " _Title
Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in ParentÂ’s reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Parent intends to assert as a
Title Defect pursuant to this Section 6.12. For all purposes of this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent will be deemed to
have waived, and none of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC will have
any liability for, any Title Defect which Parent fails to assert as a Title
Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by HPC on or  



 

44  before the Title Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice must
be in writing and include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect, (ii)
the Reserve Report Interest (and the applicable zone therein) affected by the
Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value
of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary
for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, and (v) the
amount by which Parent reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect and the computations
upon which ParentÂ’s belief is based. To give HPC an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, Parent will use reasonable efforts to
deliver to HPC, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the
Title Claim Date, written notice of all Title Defects discovered by Parent
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date. Parent will also promptly
furnish HPC with written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by
any of ParentÂ’s or any of its AffiliateÂ’s employees, title attorneys, landmen
or other title examiners while conducting ParentÂ’s due diligence with respect
to the Reserve Report Interests prior to the Title Claim Date.

(c) HPC will have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Parent on
or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a
" _Title Benefit Notice_ ") including (i) a description of the Title Benefit,
(ii) the Reserve Report Interests (and the applicable zone therein) affected
by the Title Benefit, and (iii) the amount by which HPC reasonably believes
the Allocated Value of those Reserve Report Interests (and the applicable zone
therein) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations upon
which HPCÂ’s belief is based. HPC will be deemed to have waived all Title
Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

(d) HPC will have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole
cost, to cure for itself, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC at any time
prior to Closing (the " _Cure Period_ "), any Title Defects of which it has
been advised by Parent.

(e) Subject to HPCÂ’s continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title
Defect or a Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event
that any Title Defect timely asserted by Parent in accordance with Section
6.12(b) is not waived in writing by Parent or cured on or before Closing, and
subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Title
Deductible, the Gross HPC Merger Consideration and the Gross Hassie Merger
Consideration, as applicable, will be reduced by an amount (" _Title Defect
Amount_ ") determined pursuant to Section 6.12(h) as being the value of such
Title Defect;

(f) With respect to each Reserve Report Interest (or specified zone therein)
affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 6.12(c), the Aggregate Title
Deductible will be increased by an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ")
equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Reserve Report Interest
caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 6.12(i).



 

45 (g) Section 6.12(c) will be the exclusive right and remedy of Parent with
respect to the failure of HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, to have Good and Defensible Title with respect to any Oil and Gas
Interest.

(h) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect will be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the affected Title Defect Property is reduced
as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and will be determined in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(i) if Parent and HPC agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount will
be the Title Defect Amount

(ii) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount will be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set
forth in the NSAI Reserve Report, then the Title Defect Amount will be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth in the NSAI
Reserve Report;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Lien upon or other defect
in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, the
Title Defect Amount will be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Parent and HPC,
HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, and such other reasonable
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; provided, however, that
if such Title Defect is reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect
Amount will not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such
Title Defect;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property will be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property will not exceed the Allocated Value of
the Title Defect Property.

(i) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit will be determined
in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:



 

46 (i) if Parent and HPC for itself or HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount will be the
Title Benefit Amount; and

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the net
revenue interest for any Reserve Report Interest (or the specified zone(s)
therein) and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth in the NSAI Reserve
Report, then the Title Benefit Amount will be the product of the Allocated
Value of the affected Reserve Report Interest (or the specified zone(s)
therein) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue
interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
set forth in the NSAI Reserve Report.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event will there be
any adjustments to the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or the Gross Hassie
Merger Consideration, as applicable, or any payments by HPC, HHEC or any
Subsidiary of HPC, for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed ($7,500,000) (" _Individual Title Defect Threshold_ ")
and (ii) in no event will there be any adjustments to the Gross HPC Merger
Consideration or the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration or any payments by HPC,
HHEC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, for any Title Defect that
exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless the Title Defect Amounts
of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold,
in the aggregate, excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller, exceeds the
Aggregate Title Deductible, after which Parent will be entitled to reductions
to the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or the Gross Hassie Merger
Consideration, as applicable, only with respect to such Title Defects in
excess of such Aggregate Title Deductible.

(k) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Parent and HPC for itself and HHEC, HHPC and
any Subsidiary of HPC will attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing.
Subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Title
Deductible limitations in Section 6.12(j), if Parent and HPC for itself and
HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC are unable to agree by Closing, the Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute will be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to this Section 6.12(k). There will be a single
arbitrator, who will be a title attorney with at least ten years experience in
oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the
Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of HPC
and Parent within 15 days after the end of the Cure Period, and absent such
agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "
_Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding will be held in Dallas
Texas and will be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 6.12. The Title ArbitratorÂ’s
determination will be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in
dispute and will be final and binding upon all parties, without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator will be bound by
the provisions of Section 6.12(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the  



 

47  Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title
Arbitrator, however, may not award Parent a greater Title Defect Amount than
the Title Defect Amount claimed by Parent in its applicable Title Defect
Notice and may not award HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, a greater Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount
claimed by HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, in its
applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator will act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect,
Title Benefit, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title Benefit Amounts submitted by
any party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with
respect to any matter. HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, and Parent will each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. Each of HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, and Parent will bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Title Arbitrator. Within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Parent and HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable,
of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount,
(i) Parent will pay to HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable, the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to HPC,
HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, and (ii) HPC, HHEC, HHPC
and any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable will pay to Parent the amount, if
any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Parent. 

6.13 _Review of Estimated Tax Liability_. Prior to Closing, Parent will have
the right to conduct, at its sole cost, a review of (a) the estimated 2008
Tax liabilities and (b) any 2007 Tax Returns which have not been filed as of
the date of this Agreement but that will be filed before the Closing.

6.14 _Cooperation Regarding Financing_. HPC and the Hassie Companies will
cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with Parent in connection with
obtaining financing in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (a) using (and causing the HPC
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent
in satisfying all conditions precedent to be satisfied by Parent in
connection with such financing, (b) providing information regarding HPC and
the Hassie Companies that is reasonably requested by the financing sources and
their representatives, (c) permitting the financing sources and their
representatives access to HPC and the Hassie Companies, respectively, (d)
participating in meetings with prospective lenders, (e) participating in bank
meetings in connection with the financing, (f) participating in drafting
sessions related to any offering materials reasonably required for any such
financing, and (g) causing members of their respective accounting firms to
participate in drafting sessions related to the offering materials for such
financing. For the avoidance of doubt, however, ParentÂ’s obligations hereunder
are not subject to financing.

6.15 _Environmental Matters_. (a) For the 60-day period after execution of
this Agreement, HPC and the Hassie Companies will give Parent reasonable
access to all environmental data and non-privileged reports and analyses
pertaining to the Reserve Report Interests in the files of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and
any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable. Parent specifically acknowledges that
(i) any access to HPCÂ’s data is provided as an accommodation only,
at ParentÂ’s sole cost, risk and expense, that none  



 

48  of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC makes any representations as to
the accuracy, completeness or reliability of any such environmental
information so disclosed to or obtained by Parent and (ii) Parent relies and
depends on and uses any and all such environmental information, review or
inspection exclusively and entirely at its own risk and without any recourse
to HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC whatsoever. HPC for itself and
HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC will cooperate with Parent for the
performance by Parent of such review and any related property or asset
inspection, which review and inspection will be conducted in a reasonable
manner so as not to interfere with the operations of the Reserve Report
Interests. HPC for itself and HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC will
cooperate to ensure that such review and inspection is conducted on a
confidential basis prior to the Environmental Claim Date. Any reports
prepared as a result of such review and inspection will be treated as
confidential except to the extent disclosure is required under applicable Law.

(b) On or before 60 days after execution of this Agreement (the "
_Environmental Claim Date_ "), Parent must deliver claim notices to HPC,
HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, meeting the requirements
of this Section 6.15(a) (collectively the " _Environmental Defect Notices_ "
and individually an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any
matters which, in ParentÂ’s reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental
Defects and which Parent intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant
to this Section 6.15. For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent will be deemed to have waived, and
none of HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any Subsidiary of HPC will have any liability for,
any Environmental Defect which Parent fails to assert as an Environmental
Defect by a Environmental Defect Notice received by HPC on or before the
Environmental Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice
must be in writing and include (i) a description of the matter constituting
the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) a description of each Reserve Report
Interest (or portion thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental
Defect, (iii) ParentÂ’s assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of the
Reserve Report Interest affected by the alleged Environmental Defect, (iv)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for HPC to verify the existence of
the alleged Environmental Defect, and (v) a calculation of the Remediation
Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Parent asserts is attributable to
such alleged Environmental Defect. ParentÂ’s calculation of the Remediation
Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable
detail the Remediation proposed for the asserted Environmental Defect and
identify all assumptions used by Parent in calculating the Remediation Amount,
including the standards that Parent asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. HPC, for itself, and HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC
will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Environmental
Defect on or before Closing.

(c) Subject to HPCÂ’s continuing right to dispute the existence of a
Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect
thereto, in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer
in accordance with Section 6.15(b) is not waived in writing by Parent or
cured on or before Closing, and subject to the Individual Environmental
Threshold and the Aggregate Environmental  



 

49  Deductible, the Gross HPC Merger Consideration and the Gross Hassie Merger
Consideration, as applicable, will be reduced by the Remediation Amount. 

(d) Section 6.15(c) will be the exclusive right and remedy of Parent with
respect to any Environmental Defect. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event will there be
any adjustments to the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or the Gross Hassie
Merger Consideration, as applicable, for any individual Environmental Defect
for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $7,500,000 (" _Individual
Environmental Threshold_ ") and (ii) in no event will there be any
adjustments to the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or the Gross Hassie Merger
Consideration, as applicable, or any other payments by HPC, HHEC, HHPC or any
Subsidiary of HPC for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation
Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless the Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any Environmental Defects
cured by HPC, exceeds the Aggregate Environmental Deductible, after which
Parent will be entitled to reductions to the Gross HPC Merger Consideration or
the Gross Hassie Merger Consideration, as applicable, only with respect to
such Environmental Defects in excess of such Aggregate Environmental
Deductible.

(f) Parent and HPC for itself and HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC will
attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to
Closing. Subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible limitations in Section 6.15(d), if Parent and HPC
for itself and HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC are unable to agree by
Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute will
be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section
6.15. There will be a single arbitrator, who will be an environmental
attorney with at least ten years experience in environmental matters involving
oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the affected
Reserve Report Interests are located, as selected by mutual agreement of
Parent and HPC within 15 days after the Closing Date, and absent such
agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding will be held in
Dallas, Texas and will be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 6.15. The Environmental
ArbitratorÂ’s determination will be made within 20 days after submission of the
matters in dispute and will be final and binding upon all parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental
Arbitrator will be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 6.15 and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of
the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Parent a
greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Parent in
its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator will
act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by any  



 

50  party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with
respect to any matter. Each of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC and
Parent will each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC and Parent will bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Within ten
days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Parent and
HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, of his award with
respect to a Remediation Amount, (i) Parent will pay to HPC, HHEC, HHPC and
any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable, the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC, as
applicable and (ii) HPC, HHEC, HHPC and any Subsidiary of HPC, as applicable,
will pay to Parent the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental
Arbitrator to Parent.

6.16 _Unresolved Title Defects and Environmental Defects_. If by the Closing
Date, there remain unresolved Title Defects in an amount exceeding the
Aggregate Title Deductible or unresolved Environmental Defects in an amount
exceeding the Aggregate Environmental Deductible (collectively, the "
_Disputed Amounts_ "), the parties will, on the Closing Date, deposit the sum
of the Disputed Amounts into an interest-bearing escrow account with an escrow
agent agreed upon by Parent and HPC. The escrow agent will hold the Disputed
Amounts until the final resolution of the Title Defects and corresponding
Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts in
accordance with Sections 6.12(k) and 6.15(e), respectively.

6.17 _Financial Statements_. (a) HPC will direct its independent certified
public accounting firm to prepare and deliver an unqualified audit report of
the consolidated balance sheet of HPC and its Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and the related audited statements of operations, stockholdersÂ’ equity
and cash flows for the year then-ended, and the notes and schedules thereto
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (the " _HPC GAAP
Financial Statements_ "). HPC will cooperate, in a commercially reasonable
manner, including by providing any information reasonably requested by the
independent certified public accounting firm to assist it in connection with
the preparation of the HPC GAAP Financial Statements.

(b) HHEC will direct its independent certified public accounting firm to
prepare and deliver an unqualified audit report of the balance sheet of HHEC
as of December 31, 2007 and the related audited statements of operations,
stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows for the year then-ended, and the notes and
schedules thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (the
" _HHEC GAAP Financial Statements_ "). HHEC will cooperate, in a commercially
reasonable manner, including by providing any information reasonably requested
by the independent certified public accounting firm to assist it in connection
with the preparation of the HHEC GAAP Financial Statements.

(c) HHPC will direct its independent certified public accounting firm to
prepare and deliver an unqualified audit report of the balance sheet of HHPC
as of December 31, 2007 and the related audited statements of operations,
stockholdersÂ’  



 

51  equity and cash flows for the year then-ended, and the notes and schedules
thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (the "
_HHPC GAAP Financial Statements_ "). HHPC will cooperate, in a commercially
reasonable manner, including by providing any information reasonably requested
by the independent certified public accounting firm to assist it in connection
with the preparation of the HHPC GAAP Financial Statements.

6.18 _HPC Reorganization_. HPC will deliver to Parent copies of the Governing
Documents of each of HPC Holdco and HPC as soon as is reasonably practicable
following the consummation of the HPC Reorganization. Prior to the Effective
Time, HPC Holdco will engage in no business activities and will conduct no
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

6.19 _Tax Treatment_. (a) Prior to and at the Effective Time, each party
hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the HPC Merger to qualify
as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not take
any action reasonably likely to cause the HPC Merger not to so qualify.

(b) HPC will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinion referred to
in Section 7.3(d).

6.20 _AFEs_. Within ten Business Days following the date hereof, HPC will
deliver to Parent a schedule setting forth, as of the date of this Agreement,
all outstanding authorities for expenditure binding upon HPC, HHEC, HHPC or
any Subsidiary of HPC.

6.21 _Listed Transaction_. If Parent or any Affiliate of Parent disposes of or
causes the disposition of any assets owned by Hassie at the Effective Time of
the Hassie Merger, other than in the ordinary course of business, within one
year after the Closing, Parent shall provide notice of such disposition to
Stockholder of Hassie.

(c) _Officer Â’s Certificate_. HPC and Hassie shall have received a
certificate of Parent and the Merger Subs, validly executed for and on behalf
of Parent and the Merger Subs and in their respective names by a duly
authorized officer thereof  



 

54  (but without personal liability) certifying that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) have been satisfied.

(d) _Tax Opinion_. HPC shall have received the opinion of Jones Day, counsel
to HPC, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the HPC Merger will be
treated for Federal income tax purposes as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Jones Day will be
entitled to rely upon customary assumptions and representations provided
by Parent, HPC, the Hassie Companies and others that Jones Day reasonably
deems relevant.

VIII. TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing in the
following manner:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, HPC and the Hassie Companies; or

(b) by Parent or HPC if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have (i) enacted, issued or promulgated any Law that is in effect and
has the effect of making the Mergers illegal in any jurisdiction in which HPC,
HHEC or HHPC has material business or operations or which has the effect of
prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Mergers in any
jurisdiction in which HPC, HHEC or HHPC has material business or operations,
or (ii) issued or granted any order that is in effect prohibiting or otherwise
preventing the Mergers; or

(c) by HPC if the Effective Time has not occurred by December 1, 2008 (the "
_HPC/Hassie Termination Date_ ") unless the failure of the Effective Time to
have occurred is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by HPC,
HHEC or HHPC; or

(d) by the Hassie Companies, with respect to only the rights and obligations
under this Agreement pertaining to the Hassie Companies, if the Effective Time
has not occurred by the HPC/Hassie Termination Date unless the failure of
the Effective Time to have occurred is the result of a material breach of
this Agreement by HHEC or HHPC; or

(e) by Parent if the Effective Time has not occurred by December 1, 2008 (the
" _Parent Termination Date_ ") unless the failure of the Effective Time to
have occurred is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by Parent,
HPC Merger Sub and Hassie Merger Sub; or

(f) by HPC, in the event that (i) none of HPC, HHEC or HHPC is then in
material breach of its covenants, agreements and other obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) Parent, HPC Merger Sub or Hassie Merger Sub has breached or
otherwise violated any of its material covenants, agreements or other
obligations under this Agreement, or any of the representations and
warranties of Parent, HPC Merger  



 

55  Sub or Hassie Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement have become inaccurate,
in either case such that the conditions to the Mergers set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) are not capable of being satisfied by the HPC/Hassie
Termination Date, and (iii) such breach or violation cannot be cured or, if
curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 20 Business Days
following notice of such breach or violation and (B) the HPC/Hassie
Termination Date; or

(g) by Parent, in the event that (i) none of Parent, HPC Merger Sub or Hassie
Merger Sub is then in material breach of its covenants, agreements and other
obligations under this Agreement, (ii) HPC, HHEC or HHPC has breached or
otherwise violated any of its material covenants, agreements or other
obligations under this Agreement, or any of the representations and warranties
of HPC, HHEC or HHPC set forth in this Agreement have become inaccurate, in
either case such that the conditions to the Mergers set forth in Section
7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) are not capable of being satisfied by the Parent
Termination Date, and (iii) such breach or violation cannot be cured or, if
curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 20 Business Days
following notice of such breach or violation and (B) the Parent Termination
Date; or

(h) by HPC or Parent, regardless of the circumstances, if the Effective Time
has not occurred by December 31, 2008.

(i) by HPC if, after the No-Shop Termination Date, the board of directors of
HPC determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that an Alternative Proposal
is a Superior Proposal, provided that HPC, HHEC and HHPC have fully complied
with their obligations under Section 6.10.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 by HPC or Parent, written notice thereof
will be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement will become void and
have no effect and there will be no further liability on the part of Parent or
the Merger Subs (on the one hand) or any Hunt Entity (on the other hand),
except that the agreements contained in this Article VIII, in Section 6.2
(Confidentiality Agreement) and in Article IX (Miscellaneous) will survive the
termination hereof. In the event of a termination by the Hassie Companies
pursuant to Section 8.1(d), written notice thereof will be given to Parent
and HPC and (a) the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
pertaining to the Hassie Companies will become void and have no effect and
there will be no further liability on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs,
or any Hunt Entity with respect to any such rights or obligations as they
pertain solely to the Hassie Companies, except that the agreements of the
Hassie Companies contained in this Article VIII and in Article IX
(Miscellaneous) will survive such termination, and (b) except as modified by
Section 8.2(a) the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and HPC Holdco, Parent and HPC Merger Sub shall proceed to Closing with
respect to the HPC Merger, subject to the termination of this Agreement in
its entirety pursuant to any other provision of Section 8.1. Nothing contained
in this Section 8.2 will relieve any party from any liability for, among other
things, money damages arising out of any uncured  



 

56  breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement prior to any such termination or to impair the right of any party to
compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations under this
Agreement. The actual or alleged unavailability of financing or the cost or
other terms thereof will not excuse ParentÂ’s performance of its obligations
under this Agreement. 

IX. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants; Waiver_.
None of the representations, warranties or covenants (other than those
covenants which by their express terms contemplate performance following the
Closing) in this Agreement will survive the Mergers, but the Surviving
Agreements shall survive the Merger. Following the Effective Time, none of the
Stockholders, their respective Affiliates and advisors or the Other Hunt
Entities will have any obligations to Parent or the Surviving Corporations or
any of their respective Affiliates except as set forth in the Surviving
Agreements. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, in
consideration of the transactions herein and therein contemplated, Parent,
the Surviving Corporations and their respective Affiliates hereby waive,
effective as of the Effective Time, any and all rights, claims or causes of
action they have, had or may in the future have against any of the
Stockholders, directors, officers, member or managers of the Hunt Entities,
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives or the Other Hunt
Entities, including claims based on the federal or state securities Laws or
otherwise or theories of common law except and only to the extent provided in
the Surviving Agreements.

9.2 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications
required or permitted to be given or made hereunder by any party hereto shall

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, and the
Exhibits and other writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Each of the parties acknowledges that no other party, nor any agent or
attorney of any other party, has made any promise,  



 

58  representation or warranty whatsoever not contained herein, and that such
party has not executed or authorized the execution of this Agreement in
reliance upon any such promise, representation or warranty not contained
herein.

9.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third-Party Benefit_. This Agreement is
binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Except as
provided in Section 6.3(d) of this Agreement and Sections 6.7(a) Â– (d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or will confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto, and
their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns,
any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

9.5 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if
any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction in such manner as will
effect as nearly as lawfully possible the purposes and intent of such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision.

9.6 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD
TO ITS CHOICE OF LAWS RULES.

9.7 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of HPC, the Hassie Companies,
Parent and the Merger Subs irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, the Mergers, any provision hereof, the breach, performance,
validity or invalidity hereof or for recognition and enforcement of
any judgment in respect hereof brought by another party hereto or its
successors or permitted assigns may only be brought and determined in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware, and each of HPC, the
Hassie Companies, Parent and the Merger Subs hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue in any such court of any Proceeding set forth
above arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of HPC, the Hassie Companies, Parent and the Merger Subs hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement,
the Mergers, any provision hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement,
validity or invalidity hereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other  



 

59  than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Laws, that (i) Proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Proceeding is improper and (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

9.8 _Service of Process_. Service of any process, summons, notice or document
by U.S. registered mail to any partyÂ’s respective address set forth in
Section 9.2 will be effective service of process for any Proceeding in
Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction
as set forth in Section 9.7.

9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. It is not necessary that each
party execute the same counterpart so long as identical counterparts are
executed by each such party. This Agreement may be validly executed and
delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

9.10  _Remedies_. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) Each party agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled
at Law or in equity, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by HPC,
HHEC or HHPC, on the one hand, or Parent or the Merger Subs, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, HPC, HHEC and HHPC, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger
Subs, on the other hand, will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
other, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement.

9.11 _Disclosure Schedule_. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or to create any covenant unless clearly specified to the contrary
herein. Any disclosure in one section of the Disclosure Schedule will be
deemed to be disclosed in all sections of the Disclosure Schedule and under
this Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedule (a) does not
represent a determination  



 

60  that such item is material nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of
materiality, (b) does not represent a determination that such item did
not arise in the ordinary course of business, (c) does not represent a
determination that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement require the
consent of third parties and (d) will not constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission to any third party concerning such item. The Disclosure Schedule
includes descriptions of instruments or brief summaries of certain aspects of
HPC, HHEC, HHPC, HPCÂ’s Subsidiaries and their business and operations. The
descriptions and brief summaries are not necessarily complete and are
provided in the Disclosure Schedule to identify documents or other materials
previously delivered or made available.

9.12 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

9.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by the
written agreement of all the parties hereto prior to the Effective Time.

9.14 _Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the failure by
any Person to comply with any obligation, covenant or condition under this
Agreement may be waived by the Person entitled to the benefit thereof only by
a written instrument signed by the Person granting such waiver, but such
waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent other failure. The failure of any Person to
enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement will in no way be
construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the
validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any Person
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of such provisions will be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.

9.15 _Certain Consents and Waivers_. The parties hereto acknowledge the
extent of the prior and existing representations by counsel of the parties and
have affirmatively consented to Jones DayÂ’s representation of HPC in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any related or unrelated transactional or litigation matters now existing or
arising in the future. Each party hereto waives any objection to such
representations, any conflict of interest or other basis for
precluding, challenging or otherwise disqualifying such counsel from such
representations based on any prior or existing representation by such firm,
and agrees that no such objection, conflict of interest or other basis for
precluding, challenging or otherwise disqualifying such counsel from
representing its clients will be asserted by such party if litigation among
the parties proceeds or develops, whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are or have been consummated, and Jones Day represents one or more
party therein. Each party hereto has had the opportunity to consult with
counsel concerning this waiver, and confirms that its consent is voluntary,
fully informed and to be relied upon by the other parties hereto and
the above-referenced firm.



 

61 Accordingly, the undersigned have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their respective duly authorized officers to be effective on June 9, 2008.
