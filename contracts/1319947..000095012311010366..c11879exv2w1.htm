AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of February 8, 2011 (" _Execution Date_
") (this " _Agreement_ ") is by and among DSW Inc., an Ohio corporation ("
_DSW_ "), DSW MS LLC, an Ohio limited liability company and a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of DSW (" _Merger LLC_ "), and Retail Ventures, Inc., an
Ohio corporation (" _RVI_ "). 

  

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H:_  

   

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of DSW and RVI has
approved, and deemed it in the best interests of its shareholders to
consummate, and DSW, as the sole member of Merger LLC, has approved, the
business combination and other transactions provided for herein, including
the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of RVI with and into Merger LLC in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the "
_OGCL_ ") and the Ohio Limited Liability Company Law (the " _OLLCL_ "), and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

WHEREAS, DSW and RVI intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"); 

  

WHEREAS, DSW and RVI desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger (including, as a
condition and inducement to DSW and Merger LLC entering into this Agreement,
the voting agreement by RVI provided for in Section 5.12) and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and 

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to DSW and Merger LLC entering into this Agreement,
RVI has adopted a Rights Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Rights Agreement_ "), with Computershare Investor Services Inc., as Rights
Agent, intended to help protect RVIs net operating losses and certain other
tax assets, in connection with which the RVI Board of Directors authorized
and declared a dividend distribution of one common share purchase right (a "
_Common Stock Purchase Right_ ") for each outstanding share of RVI Common
Stock at the close of business on February 24, 2011. 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

1.1 _Effective Time of Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be duly
prepared, executed by RVI and Merger LLC and thereafter delivered to the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio for filing, as provided in the OGCL
and OLLCL, on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Ohio or at such time thereafter as is agreed upon in writing by DSW and
RVI and provided for in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_
"). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the
second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
Law) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at
the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions),
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The Closing shall be held at the offices of DSW in Columbus, Ohio, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, RVI shall be merged with
and into Merger LLC and the separate existence of RVI shall cease and Merger
LLC shall continue as the surviving entity in the Merger. The Merger will
have the effects set forth in the OGCL and OLLCL. As used in this
Agreement, " _Surviving Entity_ " shall mean Merger LLC, at and after the
Effective Time, as the surviving entity in the Merger. 

  

1.4 _Articles of Organization_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
organization of Merger LLC as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. 

  

1.5 _Operating Agreement_. At the Effective Time, the operating agreement of
Merger LLC as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
operating agreement of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

1.6 _Officers of Surviving Entity_. The officers of Merger LLC as of the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an
officer. 

  

1.7 _Directors of DSW_. Prior to the Effective Time, the DSW Board of
Directors shall take all necessary corporate action (i) to increase the size
of the DSW Board of Directors by one member, such that at the Effective Time
the DSW Board of Directors shall consist of 12 members, and (ii) to fill
the vacancies on the DSW Board of Directors created by such increase,
effective immediately after the Effective Time, with the current member of
the RVI Board of Directors listed on Schedule 1.7 (the " _Designated
Director_ "). If prior to the Effective Time, the Designated Director, or
Harvey Sonnenberg, is unwilling or unable to serve as a director of DSW for
any reason, or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the DSW
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with legal
counsel, that the Designated Director would not qualify as an "independent"
director of DSW under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ "),
then RVI shall replace such person, upon consultation prior to the Effective
Time with, and in consideration of the views of, the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee of the DSW Board of Directors, and thereafter (other
than in the case of Mr. Sonnenberg or any replacement of Mr. Sonnenberg) such
replacement shall constitute a Designated Director. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER 

   

2.1 _Effect on Capital Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of RVI Common
Stock: 

  

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. All common shares, without par value,
of RVI (the " _RVI Common Stock_ ") that are owned by RVI as treasury stock
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no Class A common shares,
without par value, of DSW (the " _DSW Class A Stock_") or Class B common
shares, without par value, of DSW (the " _DSW Class B Stock_", and together
with the DSW Class A Stock, the " _DSW Common Stock_ ") or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

(b) _Conversion of the RVI Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.4, each share
of RVI Common Stock (and each associated Common Stock Purchase Right) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares of RVI Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a),
(ii) shares of RVI Common Stock owned by DSW immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which shares shall be cancelled and extinguished, (iii) shares
of RVI Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of DSW or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of RVI immediately
prior to the Effective Time, which shares shall be cancelled and
extinguished, and (iv) RVI Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in
accordance with Section 2.8(a)) shall be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.435 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of either DSW Class A Stock,
or, if such holder has effectively made an election to receive DSW Class B
Stock in lieu of DSW Class A Stock in accordance with Section 2.2, DSW Class
B Stock (such DSW Common Stock, together with any cash paid in respect of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.4, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all such shares of RVI Common
Stock, together with all associated Common Stock Purchase Rights, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares (or book entry representing any such non-certificated shares) and
associated Common Stock Purchase Rights shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or
other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(c)) in
respect of such shares upon the surrender of the certificate or book entry
representing such shares in accordance with Section 2.3 (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.5). No holder of shares
of RVI Common Stock who demands payment of the fair cash value of such shares
pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall thereafter be entitled to elect
to receive DSW Class B Stock in lieu of DSW Class A Stock with respect to RVI
Dissenting Shares, which RVI Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance
with Section 2.8(a), regardless of whether such holder fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal. 

  

(c) _Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into DSW Common Stock or RVI Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to DSW 

 

    ##### 

  

 

Common Stock or RVI Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

    

2.2 _Election Procedures_.

mailed to the RVI shareholders (the " _Mailing Date_ "), DSW shall cause an
election form (the " _Election Form_ ") to be mailed to each holder of record
of shares of RVI Common Stock as of the record date for the RVI Shareholders
Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). 

  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner,
within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), through appropriate and customary
documentation and instructions), to elect to receive DSW Class B Stock in
lieu of DSW Class A Stock (an " _Election_ ") and shall provide that all
shares of RVI Common Stock with respect to which an Election has not properly
been made during the period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the Mailing Date
to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the fifth business day prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Election Deadline_ "), shall be converted into DSW Class A Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(b). DSW shall publicly announce the anticipated
Election Deadline at least ten (10) business days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time. If the Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the
Election Deadline shall be delayed by the same number of days, and DSW shall
promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Deadline. 

  

(c) DSW shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of RVI
Common Stock during the Election Period, and DSW shall provide to the
Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein. 

  

(d) Any Election made pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. If an
Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of RVI Common
Stock represented by such Election Form shall be deemed to be converted into
DSW Class A Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(b), except to the extent (if any) a
subsequent election is properly made during the Election Period with respect
to any or all of the shares of RVI Common Stock covered by that Election
Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form,
the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding
and conclusive. None of DSW or RVI or the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

2.3 _Surrender and Payment_. 

  

(a) Prior to the date of mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, DSW
shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to
RVI for the purpose of exchanging certificates or book entries, as
applicable, which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of
RVI Common Stock and the associated Common Stock Purchase Rights (the "
_Certificates_ "), for the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to an
exchange agent agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
RVI. On or before the Effective Time, DSW shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration to be exchanged
or paid in accordance with this Article II, and DSW shall make available from
time to time after the Effective Time as necessary, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.4 and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of
RVI Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). The Surviving
Entity shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of record of shares of RVI Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, promptly after the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to DSW and RVI and shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title in
respect of the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions to effect the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(c). 

  

(b) Each holder of shares of RVI Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(c),
upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such shares
and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, shall
be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of RVI Common Stock. The holder of such Certificate, upon its
delivery thereof to the Exchange Agent, shall also receive any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(c). Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled as of the
Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate, following the
Effective Time, shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu
of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4 and any dividends or other
distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(c). No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
pursuant to this Section 2.3. 

  

(c) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof with respect to DSW Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of all shares of DSW Common Stock issuable pursuant
to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to DSW Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the DSW Common Stock such holder is entitled to
receive until the holder of such 

 

    ##### 

  

 

Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.3. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of DSW Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of DSW Common Stock. 

   

(d) In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of RVI Common Stock is
not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of RVI, or if any
certificate or book entry for the applicable Merger Consideration is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of the issuance of a certificate or book
entry representing shares of DSW Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of such shares of RVI Common Stock, or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. For purposes of this Agreement, " _person_ " means an individual, a
corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a
trust or any other entity or organization, including a Governmental Entity. 

  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of RVI Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate formerly representing shares of RVI Common Stock is presented to
the Surviving Entity, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II, except as provided in Section 2.8(a) with respect
to RVI Dissenting Shares. 

  

(f) None of DSW, Merger LLC, RVI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares of RVI Common Stock for
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

(g) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity and DSW shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of shares of RVI Common Stock, and from any dividends or other
distributions that the holder is entitled to receive under Section 2.3(c),
such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or DSW is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of United States (" _U.S._ ") federal, state or local
tax Law or any other non-U.S. tax Law or any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Entity or DSW, such amounts withheld from the Merger
Consideration and other such amounts payable under Section 2.3(c) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the
holder of the shares of RVI Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or
DSW. 

  

(h) Any portion of the certificates evidencing shares of DSW Common Stock, the
cash to be paid in respect of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4 and
the cash or other 

 

    ##### 

  

 

property in respect of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.3(c) supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of RVI Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to DSW, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his
shares of RVI Common Stock for the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.3 prior to the time of demand shall thereafter
look only to DSW for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect to DSW Common Stock to which
such holder was entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c), in each case, without
interest. 

   

2.4 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing less than one share of
DSW Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for shares of RVI Common Stock
upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of shares of RVI Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of DSW Common Stock
upon surrender of Certificates for exchange (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in Section 2.5) shall be paid upon such
surrender (and after taking into account and aggregating shares of RVI Common
Stock represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking
into account and aggregating all shares of RVI Common Stock represented by
all Certificates surrendered by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by
(b) the closing price for a share of DSW Class A Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

2.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
representing shares of RVI Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article II in respect
of the shares of RVI Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificates; _provided_ that DSW may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
DSW or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

2.6 _Options and Other RVI Stock Awards_. From and after the Effective Time,
(x) options to purchase shares of, and stock appreciation rights based on,
RVI Common Stock (each, a " _RVI Option/SAR_ ") held by any current or former
employee, consultant, independent contractor or director and (y)
other compensatory awards based on RVI Common Stock (collectively with the
RVI Options/SARs, the " _RVI Stock Awards_ ") held by any current or former
employee, consultant, independent contractor or director which are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become, respectively, options to purchase, or, as the case may be, stock
appreciation rights based on shares of DSW Class A Stock (each, a "
_Converted Option/SAR_ "), and with respect to all other RVI Stock Awards,
awards based on shares of DSW Class A Stock (the " _Converted Stock Awards_ "
and, together with the Converted Options/SARs, the " _Converted Equity Awards_
"), in each case, on terms substantially identical to those in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the terms of the stock
incentive plan or other related agreement or award pursuant to which such 

 

    ##### 

  

 

RVI Stock Award was granted (after giving effect to any acceleration
of vesting that occurs by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_  that from and after the Effective Time, (i) each such
Converted Option/SAR may be exercised solely to purchase or otherwise in
respect of shares of DSW Class A Stock, (ii) the number of shares of DSW
Class A Stock issuable upon exercise of such Converted Option/SAR shall be
equal to the number of shares of RVI Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise under the corresponding RVI Option/SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under such Converted
Option/SAR shall be the per share exercise price of the corresponding RVI
Option/SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and (iv) the number of shares of
DSW Class A Stock subject to such Converted Stock Awards shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of RVI Common Stock subject to the
corresponding RVI Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

    

2.7 _Other RVI Securities_. 

  

(a) RVI, DSW and Merger LLC shall cooperate and take all actions necessary or
appropriate in order for the Surviving Entity to assume, as of the Effective
Time, the warrants issued by RVI to purchase shares of RVI Common Stock or
DSW Class A Stock held by RVI (each, a " _RVI Warrant_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with their respective
terms and conditions. The parties acknowledge that (i) as of the date of
this Agreement, holders of the outstanding warrants issued by RVI to purchase
shares of RVI Common Stock or DSW Class A Stock held by RVI are entitled to
exercise such RVI Warrants for shares of DSW Class A Stock, shares of RVI
Common Stock or a combination thereof, and (ii) following the Effective Time,
(A) the right to exercise such RVI Warrants for shares of DSW Class A Stock
shall continue in accordance with the terms of the RVI Warrants and (B) the
right to exercise such RVI Warrants for shares of RVI Common Stock shall
be treated in the manner contemplated by Section 4.1 of the RVI Warrants as
the right to receive the highest amount of securities, cash or other property
to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder upon
such consummation of the Merger if such holder had exercised its RVI Warrant
immediately prior thereto and shall be deemed to include the right of such
holder to elect to receive DSW Class B Stock in lieu of DSW Class A Stock
upon exercise of the RVI Warrant for shares of RVI Common Stock following the
Effective Time (provided that if such holder fails to so elect to receive DSW
Class B Stock upon exercise of the RVI Warrant, such holder shall receive DSW
Class A Stock). 

  

(b) RVI, DSW and Merger LLC shall cooperate and take all actions necessary or
appropriate in order for the Surviving Entity to assume, as of the Effective
Time, by supplemental indenture and supplemental agreement RVIs obligations
under the Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2006 (the " _PIES Indenture_ "),
between RVI and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, the Notes and
the Collateral Agreement (as defined in the PIES Indenture) related to the
6.625% Mandatorily Exchangeable Notes due September 15, 2011.

2.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of RVI
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands payment of the fair cash value of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Sections 1701.84 and
1701.85 of the OGCL (the " _RVI Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the
Effective Time shall represent the right to payment of the fair cash value of
such shares in accordance with, and to the extent of, the provisions
of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL and at the Effective Time, all
RVI Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose its
rights as a dissenting shareholder under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL or other
applicable Law, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair cash value of such
holders RVI Dissenting Shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall be
terminated and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the
Effective Time, each such RVI Dissenting Share shall thereafter be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration (that,
for the avoidance of doubt, will consist exclusively of DSW Class A Stock and
any cash paid in respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.4). RVI shall deliver prompt notice to DSW of any demands for payment of
the fair cash value of any shares of RVI Common Stock, any withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and
received by RVI relating to rights to be paid the fair cash value of RVI
Dissenting Shares, and DSW shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, RVI shall not, without the prior
written consent of DSW, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

(b) Shares of DSW Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands payment of the fair cash value of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 1701.85
of the OGCL (the " _DSW Dissenting Shares_ "), shall, at the Effective
Time, be treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL. DSW shall deliver prompt notice to RVI of any demands for payment of
the fair cash value of any shares of DSW Common Stock. Prior to the Effective
Time, DSW shall not, without the prior written consent of RVI, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

2.9 _Consent of Surviving Entity_. The Surviving Entity hereby consents to be
sued and served with process in the State of Ohio and to the irrevocable
appointment of the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio as its agent to
accept service of process in any proceeding in the State of Ohio to enforce
against the Surviving Entity any obligation of RVI, or to enforce the rights
of a dissenting shareholder of RVI.

subsection of this Section 3.1, as set forth in the correspondingly
identified subsection of the disclosure schedule delivered by RVI to
DSW concurrently herewith (the " _RVI Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being
understood by the parties that the information disclosed in one subsection of
the RVI Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in each other
subsection of the RVI Disclosure Schedule with respect to which the relevance
of such information thereto would be reasonably apparent) or (y) as disclosed

after January 31, 2009 and at least two (2) business days prior to the date
of this Agreement, and publicly available as of the date of this Agreement
(excluding any cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements set forth
in any section of such RVI SEC Documents, including any statements in any
section captioned "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements"), RVI represents and warrants (subject to the limitation
set forth in subsection (n) of this Section 3.1) to DSW as follows: 

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. RVI is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio,
has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such other
jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify and be in such standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on RVI. The Articles of Incorporation and Code of
Regulations of RVI, copies of which were previously made available to DSW,
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement: 

   

(i) the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person means any
other person, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a
majority of the securities or other interests that have by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such person, is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by the first person or by any one or more of
its Subsidiaries, or by the first person and one or more of its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_ that DSW and its Subsidiaries shall not be regarded
as Subsidiaries of RVI for purposes of this Agreement unless otherwise
expressly provided herein; 

   

(ii) other than with reference to any litigation arising from allegations of a
breach of fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to (x)
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) any public
disclosure concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
any reference to the term " _material adverse effect_ " means, with respect
to RVI, an adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, businesses
or results of operations of RVI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole in an
amount greater than $17,500,000 that is neither reflected nor reserved for in
the consolidated financial statements of RVI included in its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 30, 2010, as filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _RVI 10-Q_ ") nor an ordinary

operating expense or expense relating to the Merger; _provided_ that, for
purposes of this clause (ii), the following (alone or in combination) shall
not be deemed to have a "material adverse effect": any change or event caused

conditions, (B) changes in generally accepted accounting principles
or requirements or interpretations thereof, (C) changes in applicable Laws or
interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity, (D) the execution,

major hostilities, act of terrorism, act of God or other force majeure
event occurring after the date of this Agreement, or (F) changes in RVIs
stock price or trading volume (unless due to a change or event that would
separately constitute a "material adverse effect" with respect to RVI),
except, in the case of clauses (A), (B), (C) or (E), to the extent such
changes or developments have a disproportionate effect on RVI and
its Subsidiaries. In addition, the SEI Loan will not be (I) considered, in
and of itself, to have a "material adverse effect" or (II) considered in the
determination of whether a change or event constitutes a "material adverse
effect." 

   

(b) _Capital Structure_. 

   

(i) The authorized capital stock of RVI consists of 160,000,000 shares of RVI

nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. 

   

(ii) Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the RVI Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list as of the Execution Date of each RVI Warrant then

held by RVI subject to such RVI Warrant and the exercise or purchase price
(if any) and the expiration date thereof. 

   

(iii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to
vote on any matters on which shareholders may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ") of RVI
are issued or outstanding. 

   

(iv) Except for (A) this Agreement, (B) the RVI Warrants, (C) the RVI Stock

under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). 

   

(v) Since January 30, 2010, except as permitted by Section 4.1 or as provided
for by the Rights Agreement, RVI and its Subsidiaries have not (A) issued or
permitted to be issued any shares of capital stock, other equity interests or
securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of RVI or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, for this purpose, DSW), other than pursuant to and as required by
the terms of RVI Warrants or RVI Stock Awards granted prior to the

adoption of this Agreement by the Required RVI Vote, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of RVI,
subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the Required RVI
Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by RVI and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by DSW and Merger LLC,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of RVI, enforceable against RVI in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equitable principles. 

   

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (A) conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
the loss of a material benefit under, or the creation of a lien, pledge,
security interest, charge or other encumbrance on any assets (any such
conflict, violation, default, right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration, loss or creation, a " _Violation_ ") pursuant
to, any provision of the Articles of 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Incorporation, Code of Regulations or similar organizational document of RVI

foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with respect to RVI
or any Subsidiary of RVI in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by RVI or the consummation by RVI of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the failure to make or obtain which,

material adverse effect on RVI or (y) prevent, delay or impede RVIs ability
to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (A) the filing with the SEC of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and such other reports under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as may be required in connection with this Agreement

such orders as may be required in connection therewith, (B) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, and
(C) such filings with and approvals of the NYSE as may be required by
the rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

   

(d) _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

   

(i) RVI has timely filed, or furnished, as applicable, all reports,
schedules, registration statements and other documents required to be filed
or submitted by it with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or other applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies, rules or
interpretations thereof since January 1, 2008 (the " _RVI SEC Documents_ ").
As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing), the RVI SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such RVI
SEC Documents, and none of the RVI SEC Documents when filed (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The RVI SEC Documents included all certificates required to
be included therein pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the internal control report and
attestation of RVIs outside auditors required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. RVI has not received any written comments from the SEC staff that
have not been resolved to the satisfaction of the SEC staff. Since January 1,
2008, RVI has not received a stop order or other order suspending the
effectiveness or 

 

    ##### 

  

   

use of any registration statement or prospectus filed by RVI under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act and, to the Knowledge of RVI, the SEC has
not issued any such order since such date. As used in this Agreement, the
word " _Knowledge_ " means as to a particular matter, the actual knowledge,
after reasonable inquiry, of any officer of RVI or DSW, as the case may be.
For this purpose, " _reasonable inquiry_ " means, with respect to each
person, (i) review of files and other information in his or her possession,
custody or control and (ii) inquiry of employees of RVI or its Subsidiaries
or DSW or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, who have responsibilities
pertinent to such inquiry and access to information in the
possession, custody or control of RVI or its Subsidiaries or DSW or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and responsive thereto. 

   

(ii) The financial statements of RVI (including the related notes and
supplemental schedules) included in the RVI SEC Documents complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing), in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of RVI and its consolidated Subsidiaries and
the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash
flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements to normal year-end adjustments). 

   

(iii) RVI and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations of
any kind, character, nature or description whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and regardless of when
asserted or by whom (collectively, " _Liabilities_ ") required by generally
accepted accounting principles to be reflected or reserved against in the
consolidated balance sheet of RVI and its Subsidiaries (or disclosed in the
notes to such balance sheet), except for (A) Liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved for in the most recent Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q filed by RVI prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _RVI Financial
Statements_ "), (B) Liabilities incurred since the date of the most recent
condensed consolidated balance sheets of RVI appearing in the RVI Financial
Statements in the ordinary course of business, (C) Liabilities which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on RVI, determined without regard to whether such
Liabilities arose out of facts or circumstances known by any of the parties
to this Agreement, (D) Liabilities incurred pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (E) Liabilities discharged or paid in full
prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. 

   

(e) _Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements_. 

   

(i) RVI and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are
material to the operation of the businesses of RVI and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (the " _RVI_  

 

    ##### 

  

   

 _Permits_ "), and RVI and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms
of the RVI Permits except where the failure so to hold or comply,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on RVI. 

   

(ii) RVI and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable laws, statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances, judgments,
rulings, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees, orders, settlements or awards
of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "). 

   

(iii) RVI has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. RVI (A) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by RVI in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to RVIs management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and
(B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure
controls and procedures prior to the date hereof, to RVIs auditors and the
audit committee of the RVI Board of Directors (1) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect RVIs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in RVIs internal controls over financial reporting. 

   

(iv) To the Knowledge of RVI, (x) since January 1, 2008, none of RVI or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or independent auditor of RVI or
any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge
of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of RVI or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, and (y) since January 1, 2008, no
attorney representing RVI or any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or other
duty recognized under applicable federal or state statutory or regulatory Law
or at common Law (including any abdication of duty, abuse of trust or
approval of unlawful transactions) or similar violation by RVI or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to RVIs Board of Directors or any committee thereof or, to the
Knowledge of RVI, to any director or officer of RVI. 

  

(f) _Legal Proceedings_. There is no claim, suit, action, litigation,
arbitration, investigation or other demand or proceeding, whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other (each, a " _Legal Action_ "), pending or,
to the Knowledge of RVI, threatened, against or affecting RVI or any
Subsidiary of RVI, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule,
award, 

 

    ##### 

  

 

settlement, stipulation or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding or, to the Knowledge of RVI, threatened against or affecting RVI
or any Subsidiary of RVI. 

    

(g) _Taxes_. 

   

(i) RVI and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all material tax
returns required to be filed by any of them, and each such return is true,
complete and accurate in all material respects, and RVI and each of its
Subsidiaries have paid (or RVI has paid on their behalf) all material taxes
due, whether or not shown as due on such returns, and the most recent
financial statements contained in the RVI SEC Documents reflect an
adequate reserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, for all material taxes not yet due and payable by RVI and its
Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. 

   

(ii) No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes or for failure to
file tax returns have been proposed, asserted or assessed against RVI or any
of its Subsidiaries. 

   

(iii) All agreements that either RVI or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been
a party to that would cause it to be liable on or after the Execution Date
(whether by Law or contract) for any material tax determined, in whole or in
part, by taking into account any income, sale, asset of or any activity
conducted by any other person are set forth in the RVI Disclosure Schedule. 

   

(iv) Neither RVI nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to modify, extend or
waive the statute of limitations relating to any tax or any tax return. 

   

(v) RVI and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with all applicable Law relating to the deposit, collection, withholding,
payment or remittance of any material tax. 

   

(vi) There is no lien for any material tax upon any asset or property of RVI
or any of its Subsidiaries other than for taxes that are not yet due and
payable. 

   

(vii) Neither RVI nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever participated in any
reportable transaction within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(1). 

   

(viii) RVI has at least $250,000,000 of net operating losses for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. RVI has no Knowledge of any reason (or of any fact or
circumstances that may give rise to any reason) that DSWs use of such net
operating losses would be restricted or limited after the Merger, other than
Knowledge RVI may acquire as a result of any filings by third parties with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that may be made after the date hereof
with respect to ownership of RVI Common Stock, but RVI makes no representation
or warranty regarding whether any ownership change (within the contemplation
of Section 382 of the Code), over which RVI does not have control, will or
will not occur. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ix) Neither RVI nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of
any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

Notwithstanding any statement or implication to the contrary in this Section
3.1(g), RVI does not make any representation or warranty regarding any
information furnished by DSW to RVI relating to taxes, and none of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Section 3.1(g) will be
considered to be untrue or inaccurate to the extent that the untruth or
inaccuracy results from information furnished by DSW to RVI. For the purpose
of this Agreement, the term " _tax_ " (including, with correlative meaning,
the terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall mean (A) all Federal, state, local and
foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales,
employment, use, property, withholding, excise, occupancy and other taxes,
duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts, (B) Liability
for the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (A) as a
result of being or having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group, and (C) Liability for the payment of any amounts
as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any
express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to
the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (A) or (B). 

   

(h) _Benefit Plans_. 

   

(i) Section 3.1(h) of the RVI Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete
and correct list of each RVI Benefit Plan. A " _RVI Benefit Plan_ " is an
employee benefit plan including any "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), any multiemployer plan within the meaning of ERISA
Section 3(37)) and each stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment,
change-in-control, fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive
or deferred compensation plan, agreement, program, policy or other
arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA (all the foregoing being herein
called " _Benefit Plans_ ") (x) maintained, entered into or contributed to by
RVI or any of its Subsidiaries under which any present or former employee,
director, independent contractor or consultant of RVI or any of its
Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits or (y) under which
RVI or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any
present or future liability. No RVI Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

   

(ii) With respect to each material RVI Benefit Plan, RVI has made available to
DSW a true, complete and correct copy of the plan document or other governing
instrument, and, to the extent applicable: (A) any related trust agreement or
other funding instrument; (B) the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter; (C) any summary plan description and summaries of
material modifications; (D) the most recent years Form 5500 and
attached schedules and audited financial statements; and (E) any actuarial
reports for RVI issued since January 31, 2009. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) With respect to the RVI Benefit Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of RVI, there exists
no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which RVI or any of
its Subsidiaries could be subject to any material Liability under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable Law. Each of the RVI Benefit Plans has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws
and the terms of such plan document or other governing instrument. 

   

(iv) No RVI Benefit Plan exists that could result in the payment to any person
of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or
benefits to any person as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether alone or in connection with any other event, and whether
or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning
of Code Section 280G. 

   

(v) No Liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
RVI, or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together
with RVI would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001(b) of ERISA (a " _RVI ERISA Affiliate_ "), that has not been satisfied
in full, and (B) no condition exists that presents a risk to RVI or any RVI
ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such Liability. Each RVI Benefit Plan which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is currently so
qualified and has been so qualified and has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the
qualification and tax-exempt status of the Employee Plan, and nothing has
occurred (or failed to occur) that could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of the plans qualification and tax-exempt status. 

   

(vi) Except as required by Section 4908B of the Code and Title I, Part 6 of
ERISA, RVI has no liability in respect of or any obligation to provide post-
retirement health and medical benefits for retired or former employees of RVI
or any of its ERISA Affiliates. 

   

(vii) Neither RVI nor any ERISA Affiliate has, since October 3, 2004, (i)
granted to any Person an interest in a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)), which interest has been or,
upon lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest,
will be subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or
(b)(4)(A), or (ii) modified the terms of any nonqualified
deferred compensation plan in a manner that would cause an interest
previously granted under such plan to become subject to the taxes imposed by
Code Section 409A. Further, no Person had a legally binding right to an
amount under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of RVI or any ERISA
Affiliate prior to January 1, 2005 that is subject to a substantial risk
of forfeiture or a requirement to perform future services after December 31,
2004, which would subject such Person to the taxes imposed by Code Section
409A. 

  

(i) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since October 30, 2010, (x) there
has not been any change, circumstance or event which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material
adverse effect on RVI, regardless of whether 

 

    ##### 

  

  

such change, event, occurrence, state of fact or development arose out of
facts or circumstances known by any of the parties to this Agreement, and (y)
neither RVI nor any of its Subsidiaries has revalued any of their respective
material assets resulting in a material impairment charge. Since October 30,
2010, neither RVI nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) made or declared any
distribution in cash or in kind to its stockholders, (ii) sold or otherwise
disposed of any material asset outside of the ordinary course of business or
(iii) made or committed to make capital expenditures in excess of $100,000
with respect to any individual expenditure or in excess of $250,000 for
all capital expenditures in the aggregate. Neither RVI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any steps to seek protection pursuant to any
bankruptcy law nor does RVI have any Knowledge or reason to believe that its
creditors intend to initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings or any
Knowledge of any fact which would reasonably lead a creditor to do so. RVI
and its Subsidiaries, individually and on a consolidated basis, are as of the
date hereof, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby
to occur at the Closing will be, Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement,
the word " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to a person, means that,
immediately following the Effective Time, (a) the fair value of the assets of
RVI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will exceed the amount of
all Liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of RVI and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, (b) the amount of the Present Fair Salable Value of
the assets of RVI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will, as of
such time, exceed the probable value of all of their Liabilities on a
consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as such Liabilities become
absolute and matured, (c) RVI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will not have, as of such time, an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the businesses in which they are engaged or will be engaged and
(d) RVI and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay their respective Liabilities
as they become absolute and mature. For purposes of the definition of "
_Solvent_ ," " _Present Fair Salable Value_ " means the amount that may be
realized if the aggregate assets of RVI and its Subsidiaries (including
goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-
length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises. 

  

(j) _Board Approval_. As of the date of this Agreement, the RVI Board of
Directors, by resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held, has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests
of RVI and its shareholders, (ii) adopted a resolution approving this
Agreement pursuant to Section 1701.791 of the OGCL, (iii) recommended that
the shareholders of RVI adopt this Agreement (the " _RVI Recommendation_ ")
and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by RVI
shareholders at the RVI Shareholders Meeting. No "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover law or regulation is
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Rights Agreement provides that neither DSW nor
Merger LLC will become an "Acquiring Person," and that no "Stock Acquisition
Date", "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as such terms are defined in
the Rights Agreement) will occur, as a result of the approval, execution or
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

(k) _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of RVI Common Stock to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger (the " _Required RVI Vote_ ") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of RVI capital stock necessary to approve and
adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(l) _Brokers or Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or person except Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. ("
_Houlihan_ ") is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any
other similar commission or fee from or through RVI in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. RVI has disclosed to DSW all
material terms of the engagement of Houlihan. 

  

(m) _Opinion of RVI Financial Advisor_. Houlihan has rendered its opinion to
the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors of RVI to the effect
that, as of the date of the meeting of the Strategic Review Committee at
which the Strategic Review Committee approved and recommended this Agreement
and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in
its opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the unaffiliated shareholders of RVI. 

  

(n) _Limitation on Representations and Warranties_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 3.1, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the representations and warranties of RVI set forth in this Section 3.1 and
any matters set forth in the RVI Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
relate solely to RVI and its Subsidiaries, excluding RVIs investment in DSW
and its Subsidiaries for all such purposes, including, for purposes of
determining whether any effect on RVI is material or constitutes a material
adverse effect on RVI, or whether any event, matter or circumstance is
material to RVI, except that all references to RVI and its Subsidiaries from
the fourth sentence of Section 3.1(i) through the end of Section 3.1(i) refer
to RVI and all of its Subsidiaries, including RVIs investment in DSW and its
Subsidiaries. 

   

3.2 _Representations and Warranties of DSW_. Except (x) with respect to any
subsection of this Section 3.2, as set forth in the correspondingly
identified subsection of the disclosure schedule delivered by DSW to
RVI concurrently herewith (the " _DSW Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being
understood by the parties that the information disclosed in one subsection of
the DSW Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in each other

such information thereto would be reasonably apparent), or (y) as disclosed

properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such other
jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify and be in such standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on DSW. The Articles of Incorporation and Code of
Regulations of

the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to either of the parties, or
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered
by either party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and,
to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC,
disseminated to the shareholders of RVI and DSW and, if required in
connection therewith, proxies shall be re-solicited with respect thereto.

comments. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of RVI
and DSW, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ that RVI, in connection with a Change in RVI Recommendation, and
DSW, in connection with a Change in DSW Recommendation, may amend or
supplement the proxy statement for RVI, the proxy statement for DSW or the
Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) to effect or reflect such
change without the other partys approval, by an amendment or supplement
which effects or reflects a Change in RVI Recommendation or a Change in DSW
Recommendation (as the case may be); _provided_ _further_ that any such
amendment or supplement is limited to (A) a Change in RVI Recommendation or a
Change in DSW Recommendation (as the case may be), (B) a discussion of the
reasons of the RVI Board of Directors or DSW Board of Directors (as the case
may be) for making such Change in RVI Recommendation or Change in
DSW Recommendation (as the case may be) and (C) background information
regarding the RVI Board of Directors or DSW Board of Directors (as the case
may be) deliberations and conclusions relating to the Change in RVI
Recommendation or Change in DSW Recommendation (as the case may be) or other
factual information reasonably related thereto. Each party will provide the
other party with a copy of all filings made with and written communications to
the SEC.

(b) _RVI Shareholders Meeting_. RVI shall duly take all lawful action to
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which

RVI Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall not (i)
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to DSW (including a change to
"neutral"), the RVI Recommendation or (ii) publicly propose to, or publicly
announce that the RVI Board of Directors has resolved to, take any such
action (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in RVI Recommendation_ "), except as
and to the extent permitted by Section 5.4(b). 

  

(c) _DSW Shareholders Meeting_. DSW shall duly take all lawful action to
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which
the Form S-4 becomes effective (the " _DSW Shareholders Meeting_ " and,
together with the RVI Shareholders Meeting, the " _Required Shareholders
Meetings_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Required DSW Vote with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it is

(d) _Timing for Required Shareholders Meetings_. RVI and DSW shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the RVI Shareholders Meeting and the DSW
Shareholders Meeting to be held on the same date. Once the Required
Shareholders Meetings have been called and noticed, neither RVI nor DSW shall
postpone or adjourn its respective Required Shareholders Meeting without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. 

  

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice, RVI and DSW shall each (and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the representatives of the other,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, records and
officers and make available to the other such financial and other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
any applicable privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information or contravene any Law or any binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of 

 

    ##### 

  

   

this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply, if necessary, restricting review of certain sensitive
material to the receiving partys outside legal counsel. 

  

(b) The parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence and act to preserve any applicable privilege with respect to such
information in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Master
Separation Agreement, dated as of July 5, 2005, between RVI and DSW (the "
_Master Separation Agreement_ "), which will remain in full force and effect
prior to the Effective Time. 

  

5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to

Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, including preparing and filing or submitting as promptly as

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(b) Each of DSW and RVI shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
Section 5.3(a), use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with the other in connection with any applications, notices, filings
and other documents and in connection with any investigation, inquiry,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) to the
extent practicable, consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity and in advance of any material
meeting or conference with any third party, and to the extent permitted by

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.3, each of RVI and DSW shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) resolve any objections, actions or proceedings asserted
or instituted by any Governmental Entity or third party challenging the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
to contest and resist any administrative or judicial action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction or
other decree or order, whether 

 

    ##### 

  

   

temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents,
materially delays or materially impedes the consummation, or otherwise
materially reduces the contemplated benefits, of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) have repealed, rescinded
or made inapplicable any Law which would otherwise prevent, delay or impede
the consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the contemplated benefits of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(d) Each of RVI and DSW and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover law or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such law or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

(a) Each of DSW and RVI agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of the officers or directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Subsidiaries or
any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including
equity interests of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its
voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the
shareholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 15%
or more of its or any of its Subsidiaries total voting power (or of the
surviving parent entity in such transaction) (any such proposal, offer or
transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other party to this
Agreement) being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "),
(ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or
data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, engage in any
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or knowingly facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or (iii)

agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase, stock purchase or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal or agree or publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, RVI and DSW
and their respective Boards of Directors shall be permitted to (A) comply
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, or make any disclosure that such partys Board of
Directors may determine (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
is required to be made under applicable Law, (B) effect a Change in RVI
Recommendation or a Change in DSW Recommendation (as applicable, a " _Change
in Recommendation_ "), (C) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any 

 

    ##### 

  

   

confidential information or data to, any person in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such person first made after
the date of this Agreement and (D) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 7.1(f) (in the case of a termination of this Agreement by RVI) or
7.1(g) (in the case of a termination of this Agreement by DSW) of this
Agreement, if and only to the extent that: 

   

(i) in any such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, (x) such
partys Required Shareholders Meeting shall not have occurred, (y) such party
has complied in all material respects with this Section 5.4 and (z) its Board
of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 

   

(ii) in any such case referred to in clause (C) above, such partys Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, determines in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and prior to providing any information or data to any
person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person,
such partys Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement having confidentiality provisions that are no less
favorable to the party providing such information than those contained in the
Master Separation Agreement; _provided_ that (x) such party furnished to the
other party to this Agreement the information and documentation required by
Section 5.4(c) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (y) prior to
effecting such a Change in Recommendation, has (together with its financial
and legal advisors) engaged in reasonable, good faith negotiations with the
other party to this Agreement, and has considered in good faith, after
consulting with its financial and legal advisors, any modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by the other party hereto to
determine whether such modifications cause such partys Board of Directors to
conclude that such Acquisition Proposal no longer requires a Change
in Recommendation; and 

   

(iii) in any such case referred to in clause (D) above, the Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn and the applicable partys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors,
that such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

  

(c) Each of DSW and RVI shall notify the other party to this Agreement of any
Acquisition Proposal received by, any information related to an Acquisition
Proposal requested from, or any discussions with or negotiations by, it or
any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
identity of such person and the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal or request for information (including a copy
thereof if in writing and any related available documentation or
correspondence), and in any event each of DSW and RVI shall provide written
notice to the other party of any Acquisition Proposal, request for information
or initiation of such discussions or negotiations within 24 hours of such
event. Each of DSW and RVI agrees that it will promptly keep the other party
informed of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including
whether withdrawn or rejected), the status and nature of all information
requested and delivered, and the status and terms of any such 

 

    ##### 

  

   

discussions or negotiations, and in any event each of DSW and RVI shall
provide the other party with written notice of any material development
thereto within 24 hours thereof. Each of DSW and RVI also agrees to provide
the other party hereto with copies of any written information that it provides
to the third party making the request therefor within 24 hours of the time it
provides such information to such third party, unless the other party hereto
has already been provided with such information. 

  

(d) Each of DSW and RVI agrees that (i) it will and will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, affiliates, agents,
representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
(ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of DSW
and RVI agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, affiliates, agents,
representatives and advisors of the obligations undertaken in this Section
5.4. 

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall permit either party to terminate this
Agreement or to submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1. 

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which the RVI Board of Directors or the DSW
Board of Directors, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into
account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the
proposal and the person making the proposal (including any required voting
agreements, break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation): (i) is more favorable to the unaffiliated shareholders of RVI
or DSW, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to any
adjustments to the terms and provisions of this Agreement committed to in
writing by RVI or DSW, as the case may be, in response to such Acquisition
Proposal) and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully
financed and is otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed;  _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior
Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a
transaction involving RVI or DSW, as the case may be. 

  

5.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. DSW shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause (i) the shares of DSW Class A Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii)
the shares of DSW Class A Stock to be reserved for issuance upon the
exercise, vesting or payment under any RVI Stock Award, to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time. 

  

5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. RVI shall give prompt notice to DSW of
the occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or failure
to occur would be reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2. DSW and 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Merger LLC shall give prompt notice to RVI of the occurrence or failure to
occur of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3.
The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party
receiving such notice. 

  

5.7 _[ Intentionally Omitted]_. 

  

5.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of RVI and DSW
shall use its reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter
(January 12, 1999) any dispositions of shares of RVI Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to RVI Common Stock) or acquisitions of
DSW Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to DSW Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect
to RVI (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby). 

  

5.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

(a) From and after the Effective Time, DSW and the Surviving Entity shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of
RVI or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _RVI Indemnified Parties_ ") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of RVI or any Subsidiary of RVI prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by RVI pursuant to RVIs Articles of Incorporation, Code of
Regulations and indemnification agreements, in existence on the date
hereof with any present or former directors, officers or employees of RVI and
its Subsidiaries. 

  

(b) DSW shall purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy for the persons who, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Effective Time, are covered by RVIs existing directors and officers
liability insurance, with respect to claims arising from facts or events
which occurred at or before the Effective Time, with coverage for six years
following the Effective Time and with substantially the same coverage and
amounts and terms and conditions as the existing policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by RVI. The one-time premium payment
for such tail policy shall not exceed 

 

    ##### 

  

   

$1,750,000 (such dollar amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). To the extent
the premium payment for such tail policy would exceed the Maximum Premium, DSW
shall acquire aggregate coverage for the maximum amount available on
substantially equivalent terms for a cost equal to the Maximum Premium. 

  

(c) DSW and the Surviving Entity shall pay (as incurred) all expenses,
including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which an indemnified
person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 5.10. 

  

(d) If DSW, the Surviving Entity or any of their successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving person in such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of DSW and the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.10. 

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each RVI Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise. 

  

5.11 _Public Announcements_. DSW, Merger LLC and RVI shall use reasonable best
efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan related to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of the NYSE in which it is impracticable to consult with each other as
contemplated by this clause (c), to consult with each other before issuing any
press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

5.12 _Voting Agreement_. 

  

(a) Until the earliest to occur of (i) the date of termination of this

in connection with the RVI Warrants issued to Schottenstein, (x) in favor of
the Merger and any actions required and in furtherance thereof, including the

    ##### 

  

  

(b) RVI shall not, directly or indirectly, during the period commencing on the
date hereof and continuing until the earliest to occur of the items

5.12(a): (i) except as contemplated by this Agreement, including any deemed
sale of the Subject Shares as a result of the Merger, offer for sale, sell,

the date hereof and continuing until the earliest to occur of the items
enumerated in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first sentence of Section

stead of RVI, to vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Shares held
of record by RVI, in the manner set forth in Section 5.12(a), at any meeting
of the stockholders of DSW. RVI hereby affirms that this irrevocable proxy is

irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.48 of the OGCL.
The irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon

matter other than those described in Section 5.12(a).

with respect to the specific matters set forth herein, and RVI shall not be
restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any
other matter presented to the shareholders of DSW. Prior to the termination
of this Agreement, RVI shall not enter into any agreement or understanding

nationally recognized accounting firm (the " _Auditor_ ") to deliver a report
on the Statement (the " _Report_ "). RVI shall present a draft of the
Statement to DSW no later than March 31, 2011. DSW shall notify RVI, within
two (2) business days after DSWs receipt of that draft, regarding whether
DSW has any objection to the draft, and may base any such objection only on
the drafts failure to comply with the Basis of Presentation. If DSW so
delivers notice of any such objection, RVI and DSW shall begin efforts to
resolve the objection immediately upon 

 

    ##### 

  

   

DSWs delivery of that notice, and shall cooperate in good faith and use
their best efforts to resolve that objection as soon as is practicable. 

  

(b) DSW shall execute an agreement with the Auditor with respect to the
Statement and Report in the form thereof required by the Auditor, and shall
provide a copy of that agreement to RVI. DSW shall advise RVI immediately
upon DSWs receipt of any communication from the Auditor concerning the
Statement or Report, shall afford RVI an opportunity to participate in any
response thereto by or on behalf of DSW, and shall make any such response as
soon as is practicable, subject only to the availability of RVI personnel for

Transactions_"). The Cash Schedule of RVIs Significant Cash
Transactions shall list the date of the transaction, whether it is a
disbursement or a receipt, the amount, and the payee if it is a disbursement.

mail;  _provided_ that nothing in this Section 8.9 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each
of the parties also agrees that any final, non-appealable judgment against a
party in connection with any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the U.S. A certified or exemplified
copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and
amount of such award or judgment. 

  

8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached or violated,
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy under applicable Law. Accordingly,
each party agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be
entitled, each of the parties is entitled to seek a decree of specific
performance and each of the parties shall further be entitled to seek an
injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of the
provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other
form of security. In the event that any suit, action or other proceeding
should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of
this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the
defense, that there is an adequate remedy under applicable Law. 

  

8.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
