contingent and becomes actual.



   3.7 | Purchasers Obligations 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Purchaser shall, upon it or any of the Group Companies

51 SCHEDULE 5

PART I

Calculation of Actual Net Debt



   1. | Preparation of Completion Accounts 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Following Completion, the Purchaser shall procure that draft
Completion Accounts (the "Draft Completion Accounts") are prepared as soon as
practicable and in any event within 40 Business Days after Completion. The
Purchaser shall then procure that the Draft Completion Accounts shall be
audited by the Companys Auditors in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule 5 and shall request that the Companys Auditors audit the Draft
Completion Accounts within 20 Business Days of their receipt of the same. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Draft Completion Accounts are to include notes
equivalent, to the extent appropriate, to those contained in the Accounts and
the Companys Auditors shall use the Draft Completion Accounts to prepare a
statement setting out the Actual Net Debt and its components, the Net
Indebtedness, the Actual Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital
Adjustment (if necessary) (the "Draft Adjustment Statement") as at the close
of business on the Completion Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Draft Completion Accounts shall be prepared in
accordance with Irish GAAP in a manner consistent with the preparation of the
Accounts and in compliance with the succeeding provisions of this Schedule 5
and shall include sufficient back up documentation to fully explain the
figures contained therein. The Draft Completion Accounts shall be in the
format set out in the proforma Completion Account Schedule set out in Part II
of this Schedule 5. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The Draft Completion Accounts and Draft Adjustment Statement
shall be delivered to the Vendors Representative and the Purchaser (each a
party for the purpose of this schedule 5) as soon reasonably practicable and
in any event no later than 90 Business Days after Completion. 
---|---|--- 



   2. | Dispute 
---|--- 

Either party may dispute the Draft Completion Accounts and/or Draft
Adjustment Statement by giving notice (in this Schedule 5 the "Notice") in
writing to the other party within 10 Business Days of receiving the Draft
Completion Accounts and Draft Adjustment Statement. The Notice shall specify:



     | (a) | the items which are disputed, 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the reasons for the dispute, and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the effect that the party issuing the Notice believes that
the items in dispute would have on the calculation of Actual Net Debt. 
---|---|--- 


 

52 For the purposes of reviewing the Draft Completion Accounts and/or Draft
Adjustment Statement each of the parties (and their accountants as
appropriate) shall be afforded reasonable access to the books and records of
the Company as are appropriate for such review and the relevant working papers
of the Companys Auditors used in auditing the Draft Completion Accounts and
the Draft Adjustment Statement.



   3. | Finalisation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If no party serves a Notice pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule 5, the Draft Completion Accounts and/or Draft Adjustment Statement
(if any) shall constitute the Completion Accounts and the statement therein
of actual net debt shall be the Actual Net Debt for the purposes of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If either party serves a Notice in accordance with paragraph
2 of this Schedule 5 then: 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | if the Purchaser and the Vendors Representative reach
agreement on the items in dispute within 10 Business Days of the Notice being
served (or such longer period as they may agree in writing), the Draft
Completion Accounts and/or Draft Adjustment Statement (if any) shall be
amended by agreement between them to reflect such agreement and the Draft
Completion Accounts and Draft Adjustment Statement (as so amended
if applicable) shall constitute the Completion Accounts for the purposes of
this Agreement and the statement therein of actual net debt shall be the
Actual Net Debt for the purposes of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | if the Purchaser and the Vendors Representative do not
reach agreement in accordance with paragraph (i) above, the Purchaser or the
Vendors Representative may refer the matter for determination to an
independent accountant appointed by agreement between them or, in the absence
of such agreement within 5 Business Days, appointed, on the application of
either such party, for the purpose by the President for the time being of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland (in this Schedule 6 the
"Expert") on the basis that the Expert is to make a decision on the dispute
and notify the parties of his decision within 30 Business Days of
receiving the reference or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter as
the Expert may determine. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | The Expert 
---|--- 

In any reference to the Expert in accordance with paragraph 3 of this
Schedule 5:



     | (a) | the Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator
and the provisions of the Arbitration Acts 1954 and 1980 shall not apply to
him or to his determination;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the decision of the Expert shall, in the absence of fraud,
be final and binding on the Purchaser and the Vendors and the Draft Accounts
and/or Draft Adjustment Statement as amended according to the decision of the
Expert (if applicable) shall be the Completion Accounts and Actual Net Debt
shall be such amount as is determined by the Expert; 
---|---|--- 



 

53 parties as is determined to be appropriate by the Expert having regard to the
merits of their respective positions in such dispute; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the Vendors and the Purchaser shall respectively provide or
to the extent that it is within their power to do so shall procure the
provision to the Expert of all such information as the Expert may reasonably
require. 
---|---|--- 



   5. | Accounting Principles 
---|--- 

The following accounting principles shall apply to the preparation of the
Completion Accounts and to the determination of the Actual Net Debt:



     | (a) | Basis of Consolidation 
---|---|--- 

The Completion Accounts comprise the consolidated financial statement of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.



     | (b) | Taxation 
---|---|--- 

The tax charged against profits for the period from the Accounts Date to the
Completion Date comprise the tax payable on profits for the period and
deferred tax in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the Completion Date, as adjusted for any tax losses forward which
can be utilised.



 

54 PART II

The Proforma Completion Accounts Schedule

[omitted]



 

55 SCHEDULE 6

Escrow Account



   1. | Establishment of Escrow Account 
---|--- 

The parties will co-operate in good faith to procure the establishment of the
Escrow Account upon or as soon as reasonably practicable after Completion so
that the Retained Amount can be transferred to it. For these purposes the
Escrow Account shall be a deposit account with AIB Bank, 40  41 Westmoreland
Street, Dublin 2 opened in the name of the Vendors Solicitors and the
Purchasers Solicitors. The signatures to the Escrow Account shall be any one
partner (duly authorised in accordance with the banks mandates) from time to
time from each of the Vendors Solicitors and the Purchasers Solicitors
respectively.



   2. | Interest 
---|--- 

The Escrow Account shall be an interest bearing account and all interest
accruing on amounts standing to the balance of the Escrow Account shall be
credited to the Escrow Account (net of any bank charges or other costs of such
account). All fees charged by the bank in relation to opening and operating
the Escrow Account shall be deducted against interest earned from time to time
and thereafter agreement any other monies standing to the credit of the Escrow
Account. The bank may also deduct from interest earned any tax required by law
to be deducted.



   3. | 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Retained Amount shall (save as otherwise provided
herein) be retained in the Escrow Account until the date (the "Escrow Payment
Date") on which the Actual Net Debt is determined in accordance with the
provisions of Clause 2.3 and Schedule 5. Subject to paragraph (b) below, upon
determination of the Actual Net Debt, the Purchaser and/or the Vendors (as the
case may be) shall be entitled on the Escrow Payment Date to that part of the
Retained Amount and the balance of interest (if any) that is equal to: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the amounts (if any) that it and/or they are entitled to
pursuant to the provisions of Clause 2.4; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | that part of the interest credited to the Escrow Account
which is attributable to such part of the Retained Amount being the same
proportion of such interest which the amount in sub-paragraph (i) of this
paragraph 3 above bears to the entire Retained Amount. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Prior to the Escrow Payment Date the Purchaser shall be entitled to assert
against the Vendors any Claim. In the event of such Claim the Purchaser shall
serve notice on the Vendors ("Notice of Claim") setting out the Purchasers
genuine pre-estimate of the Vendors liability in respect of the Claim
("Estimated Claim Amount"). Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph
3(a) and subject to the provisions of paragraph 3(c), once a Notice of Claim
has been served an amount equal to the Estimated Claim Amount shall be
deducted from the Retained Amount and retained in the Escrow Account until
such time as all Claims   

---|---|--- 



 

56  asserted prior to the Escrow Payment Date have been determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement of the parties. Following
such determination or settlement of all such Claims, the following payments
shall be made from the Escrow Account: 

---|--- 



     | (i) | to the Purchaser a sum equal to the aggregate sum due to the
Purchaser in respect of all Claims which have been settled together with that
part of the interest credited to the Escrow Account which is attributable to
the amount paid to the Purchaser under this paragraph; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to the Ordinary Shareholders on the Escrow Payment Date the
balance of the Retention Amount (if any) including interest attributable
thereto as adjusted in accordance with paragraph 3(a) above. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Where in relation to any Claim(s) to which a Notice of Claim
relates, proceedings in respect thereof are not instituted (that is to say
issued and served) within 12 months of the Escrow Payment Date (unless
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) the Vendors will cease to be
liable for any such Claim(s) and all funds then remaining in the Escrow
Account shall be released forthwith to the Ordinary Shareholders.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The Vendors and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably agree to
instruct the Vendors Solicitors and the Purchasers Solicitors respectively
to do such things as are reasonably required to pay the parties entitled
thereto the amounts referred to in paragraph 3(a) and 3(b) above. All amounts
received by any of the parties pursuant to this paragraph 3 shall be received
in or towards discharge of the amount(s) (if any) due to them pursuant to
Clause 2.4. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | Escrow Agents 
---|--- 

The Vendors Solicitors and the Purchasers Solicitors (collectively the
"Escrow Agents") shall perform only the duties expressly set forth herein. The

     | (g) | The Escrow Agents shall not be required to institute legal
proceedings of any kind. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | In the event of any disagreement between any of the parties
to this Agreement, or between any of them and any other person resulting in
adverse claims or demands being made against the Escrow Agents, or in the
event that the Escrow Agents in good faith are in doubt as to what action they
should take hereunder, the Escrow Agents may refuse to release sums from
escrow or to comply with any claims or demands on them until:-  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Escrow Agents shall have received an order of a court of
competent jurisdiction from which there is no right of appeal directing such
release or payment; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | all differences and doubts shall have been resolved by
written agreement executed by the parties to such disagreement. 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | The Vendors Representative and the Purchaser by joint

59 SCHEDULE 8

Tax Covenant



   1. | Interpretation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Definitions 
---|---|--- 

Words and expressions defined in this Schedule shall, unless the context
otherwise requires, have the following meanings:



     | (i) | "Accounts Relief", includes any Relief which has been
treated as an asset in the Completion Accounts; or any Relief which has been
taken into account in computing a provision for deferred tax which appears in
the Completion Accounts or has resulted in no provision for deferred tax being
made in the Completion Accounts; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | "Relief", includes any relief, exemption, allowance,
credit, deduction, charge or set-off available to any Group Company for the
purposes of reducing any income, profit, or gain that is subject to Tax, or
for the purposes of relieving, reducing or mitigating any Tax; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | "Tax Notice", any notice, assessment, letter, demand or
other document issued by or on behalf of any Tax Authority, or any action
taken by or on behalf of any Tax Authority, under which such Tax Authority
imposes, purports to impose or indicates that it may impose Tax on any Group

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | "Tax Liability":

Completion, in circumstances where, but for such setting off, any Group
Company would have had a liability to Tax and the Purchaser would have been
able to make a claim against the Vendors under this Schedule in respect of
such liability, 
---|---|--- 


     | C. | the loss, disallowance or unavailability in whole or in part
of any Accounts Relief but only to the extent that such loss, disallowance or
non-availability would have given rise to a reduction in the Consideration

---|---|--- 

in each case whether or not chargeable against or attributable to or
recoverable from any other person, and for the purposes of this definition,
the amount of any Tax Liability shall be deemed to be equal to:

made; 
---|---|---

   2. | Covenant 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Covenant to Pay 
---|---|--- 

The Vendors hereby severally covenant to pay to the Purchaser, as a repayment
of the Consideration paid for the Shares under this Agreement, an amount equal
to the aggregate of:



     | (i) | each and every Tax Liability arising in respect of, by
reference to or in consequence of: 
---|---|--- 


     | A. | any Transaction which occurred or was effected on or before
Completion; 
---|---|--- 



 

61 before Completion; 
---|---|--- 



     | C. | the non payment of Tax by the Vendors or any person (other
than a Group Company) which was in the same group or connected (within the
meaning of Section 839 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1985) with the
Vendors prior to Completion and which results in a Group Company being liable
to discharge such Tax Liability; 
---|---|--- 


     | D. | such amount as the Company is liable to pay or repay (other
than to another Group Company) in respect of any surrender of group relief or
arrangement under Section 36 of the Finance Act 1998 entered into prior to
Completion; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser
and/or any Group Company in connection with or in consequence of any
successful claim under this Schedule (including, without limitation, any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred in appealing or defending any Tax
Liability in accordance with paragraph 4(a) of this Schedule, and/or in
successfully taking or defending any action against the Vendors in relation
to this Schedule). 
---|---|--- 

The Vendors further hereby covenant to pay to the Purchaser an amount
equivalent to any liability to Taxation on or in respect of any sums paid
pursuant to this paragraph 2(a) of this Schedule or otherwise hereunder so
that the amount so payable shall be grossed up by such amount as will ensure
that after payment of any Taxation on or in respect of any amount, there
shall be left the sum equal to the amount that would otherwise be payable
pursuant to this paragraph 2(a) hereof or otherwise hereunder were the payment
not subject to Taxation as aforesaid.



     | (b) | Purchasers Covenant to Pay 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The Purchaser hereby covenants with the Vendors to pay to
the Vendors Representative or any other person falling within the meaning of
Section 629(4) TCA (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) an amount
equal to any Tax for which any Group Company is primarily liable to pay, but
which the Vendors (or any of them), or any other person falling within the
meaning of Section 629(4) TCA (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction)
become liable to pay as a result of a failure on the part of a Group Company
to pay such Tax. The provisions of paragraph 4 of this Schedule shall apply,
_mutatis mutandis_ , to any claim made by the Vendors against the Purchaser
under this paragraph 2(b) save that this paragraph shall not apply in respect
of any Tax for which the Vendors are liable to make (but have not yet made)
payment to the Purchaser under this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

The Purchaser covenants with the Vendors that it will pay to the Vendors such
an amount as (after deducting any Tax for which they are liable   

---|---|--- 



 

62  thereon) on an amount equal to any liability which any of them may suffer or
incur under 767A, 767AA or 767B ICTA 1988 or any equivalent enactment in
any jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom (or which any of them would have
suffered or incurred but for some Relief being available to the Vendors) by
reason of or by reference to any action or omission by any Group Company
occurring or deemed to occur at any time after Completion save that this
paragraph shall not apply in respect of any Tax for which the Vendors are
liable to make (but have not yet made) payment to the Purchaser under this
Agreement. 

---|--- 


   3. | Liability of Vendors 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Limitations on Liability of the Vendors 
---|---|--- 

The Vendors shall not be liable in respect of any claim (a "Tax Claim") made
by the Purchaser pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of this Schedule to the extent
that:



     | (i) | the liability of the Vendors under this Schedule has been
limited pursuant to Clauses 3.3(b), 3.3(c), 3.3(d), 3.5, 3.6, 3.8(c), 3.8(d),
3.9, 3.10, 3.13, 3.15, 3.16 and 3.17 of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | allowance, provision or reserve in respect thereof was made
or taken into account in the preparation of the Completion Accounts
(including, without limitation, the calculation of the Actual Net Debt); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the Tax Claim arises or the amount thereof is increased as
a result of any change of accounting date, accounting practice, or tax
reporting practice by any Group Company effected after Completion save as to
comply with generally accepted accounting principles in force at Completion; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | either the Purchaser or any Group Company has been
compensated in respect of the liability that is the subject matter of the Tax
Claim as the result of a successful Tax Claim made under the Warranties; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | the Tax Claim arises or the amount thereof is increased as a
result of a failure on the part of any Group Company or the Purchaser to file,
after Completion and within the time prescribed for doing so, such returns,
elections and notices as are reasonable; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | written notice of the Tax Claim was not given to the
Vendors Representative, as contemplated in paragraph 4(a) of this Schedule,
on or before the date that is 6 years following the date of Completion; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | to the extent that (after deduction of costs associated
with such recovery) the Purchaser or the Group (or any Group Company) have
actually recovered/are entitled to recover the loss or damage suffered by
them arising out of such Tax Claim under the terms of any insurance policy for
the time being in force or would have been entitled to recover any loss or
damage suffered by them arising out of any such Tax Claim but for any under
insurance of insurable assets or reduction by the Purchaser, the Group or any
Group Company of the level of insurance in place on the Completion Date; 
---|---|--- 



 

63 increased as a direct or indirect result of a change after the date of this
Agreement: 
---|---|--- 


     | A. | in law or published revenue or administrative practice; 
---|---|--- 



     | B. | any increase in the rates of Tax or any imposition of Tax; or 
---|---|--- 



     | C. | in Irish GAAP; 
---|---|--- 

in each case having retrospective effect;



     | (ix) | which would not have arisen but for voluntary act, omission
or transaction of the Purchaser or any Group Company after Completion
otherwise than in the ordinary course of business of the Company carried on
at Completion, except that this exclusion shall not apply where any such act,
omission or transaction is carried out or effected pursuant to a legally
binding commitment entered into by a Group Company prior to Completion;  
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | which would not have arisen but for a cessation, or any
change in the nature or conduct of any trade carried on by the Company at
Completion, being a cessation or change occurring on or after Completion. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Recovery from Third Parties 
---|---|--- 

Where the Purchaser or any Group Company is entitled to recover from a person
other than the Vendors any sum in respect of which a Tax Claim is made under
paragraph 2(a) of this Schedule (including any sum recoverable from any Tax
Authority), and the Vendors have paid to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
Tax Claim and the Group Company shall use its reasonable endeavours to recover
such amount (keeping the Vendors Representative fully informed of the
progress of any action taken) and shall pay to the Vendors Representative
any amount provided the Vendors indemnify, the Purchaser against any costs
(including additional tax) incurred in respect of any attempted recovery under
this paragraph 3 (b) so recovered (including any interest paid by such other
person on or in respect thereof) less all costs incurred by the Group Company
and/or the Purchaser in making such recovery.



     | (c) | Reduction in Tax Paid 
---|---|--- 

Where:



     | (i) | any loss, damage, cost, expense or liability of any Group
Company which is the subject matter of a claim under this Schedule results, by
way of deduction or otherwise, in a reduction of Tax payable by any Group
Company or the Purchaser; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Vendors have made a payment to the Purchaser in respect of such loss,
damage, cost, expense or liability under this Schedule,   

---|---|--- 



 

64  then, an amount equal to the amount of such Tax saving shall first be set
off against any payment then due from the Vendors to the Purchaser under
this Schedule with the amount of any excess after set-off to be forthwith
paid by the Purchaser to the Vendors as a refund of the payment previously
made by them.



     | (d) | Over-Provision or Refunds 
---|---|--- 

If any provision or reserve for Tax (excluding deferred tax) in the
Completion Accounts is found to be excessive (the amount of such excess being
referred to as an "over-provision"), or any Group Company becomes entitled
after Completion to any refund in relation to Tax paid before Completion, the
entitlement to which refund is not reflected in the Accounts provided that no
account shall be taken of any over provision or understatement to the extent
that they arise as a consequence of any utilisation of any Post Completion
Relief or action taken by any Group Company after Completion or change in law
after Completion, then the amount of the over-provision or refund shall be set
off against any payment then or subsequently due from the Vendors to
the Purchaser under this Schedule with any overpayment or refund in excess of
such set-off to be paid forthwith by the Purchaser to the Vendors as a refund
of any previous payments made by the Vendors to the Purchaser under the Tax
Covenant and to the extent after such refund there remains an excess this
shall be used by the Purchaser to be set off against any future payment under
the Tax Covenant.



     | (e) | Payment 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The Vendors shall make payment in cleared funds to the
Purchaser at least two Business Days before the date on which the Group
Company discharges, or is deemed to discharge, a claim. Any sum not paid by
the Vendors by such date shall accrue interest at a rate of 2% over the base
rate of Barclays Bank plc. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | For the purposes of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph (e)
of this Clause, the Group Company shall be deemed to discharge a claim: 
---|---|--- 


     | A. | on the date on which the Group Company is due to pay any
amount of Tax; or 
---|---|--- 



     | B. | on the date on which the Group Company would have been liable
to pay an amount of Tax but for any Relief, or other rights or claims of a
similar nature available to the Company;  
---|---|--- 



     | C. | in all other cases, thirty Business Days after the date of
notification of the claim by the Purchaser to the Vendors; 
---|---|--- 
as the case may be.



 

65 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Conduct of Tax Claims 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | If the Purchaser or any Group Company become aware of any
Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall give notice to the Vendors Representative of
that Tax Claim (including reasonably sufficient details of such Tax Claim,
the due date for any payment and the time limits for any appeal, and so far as
practicable the amount of the claim under this Schedule or under the Tax
Warranties in respect thereof) as soon as possible (and in any event not more
than 15 days after the Purchaser or the Group Company concerned becomes aware
of such claim, provided always that in a case involving a time limit for
response or appeal such notice shall be given to the Vendors Representative
not less than 10 Business Days before the expiry of that time limit). The
Purchaser shall take (or procure that the Group Company concerned shall take)
such action as the Vendors Representative may reasonably request to
avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or defend any Tax Claim and any
adjudication in respect thereof on the basis that the Company or relevant
Group Company shall be indemnified by the Vendors Representative as to such
reasonable costs and expenses any additional taxes which it may incur by
reason of such action. The Vendors Representative shall have the right (if
they wish) to control and assume conduct of any proceedings taken in
connection with such action, and shall in any event be kept fully informed of
any actual or proposed developments (including any meetings) and shall be
provided with copies of all correspondence and documentation relating to such
Tax Claim or action, and such other information, assistance and access to
records and personnel as it reasonably requires. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Subject to paragraph (iii), the Purchaser shall and shall
procure that no Tax Claim, action or issue in respect of which the Vendors
could be required to make a payment under this Schedule or for breach of any
Tax Warranty is settled or otherwise compromised without the Vendors
Representatives prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the
Group Companies and any of their respective advisers shall, not submit any
correspondence or return or send any other document to any Tax Authority where
the Purchaser or any such person is aware or could reasonably be expected
to be aware that the effect of submitting such correspondence or return or
sending such document would or could be to put such Tax Authority on notice of
any matter which could give rise to, or could increase, a claim under this
Schedule or for breach of any Tax Warranty, without first affording the
Vendors Representative a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon and
without taking account of such comments so far as it is reasonable to do so. 
---|---|--- 


 

66 have any action mentioned in paragraph 4 (a)(i) of this Schedule 8 conducted
by their nominated professional advisers provided that: 
---|---|--- 



     | A. | the appointment of such professional advisers shall be
subject to the approval of the Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and shall be deemed to be given in the event that the
Purchaser does not give a fully reasoned written response to a request for
approval by the Vendors; 
---|---|--- 



     | B. | the Vendors shall procure that the Purchaser is kept fully
informed of the progress of the relevant action and provided with copies of
all relevant correspondence and documents sent by and to the Vendors and
their professional advisers; 
---|---|--- 



     | C. | the Vendors shall procure that any reasonable comments made
by the Purchaser in relation to the relevant action are taken into account by
the Vendors and their professional advisers; and 
---|---|--- 



     | D. | the Vendors shall not be entitled to or to procure that their
professional advisers take any action referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this
Schedule 8 or take any action to make any representation which is not lawful
or not true and accurate in all respects. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | The Purchaser shall not be obliged to contest any claim for
Tax pursuant to paragraph 4 (a) (i) of this Schedule 8 before the High Court
or other senior appellant body (excluding the General Commissioners of HM
Revenue and Customs, the Special Commissioners of HM Revenue and Customs or
the Value Added Tax Tribunal in the UK and any equivalent of any such body
outside the UK) unless at the sole expense of the Vendors, the Vendors
Representative obtains the written opinion of the leading Tax counsel after
disclosure of all relevant information and documents and having regard to all
the circumstances that on the balance of probabilities the action should
succeed. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | If the Vendors Representative does not request the
Purchaser to take any action within 40 days of notice to the Vendors
Representative, the Purchaser shall be free to satisfy or settle the relevant
Group Company tax liability on such terms as it may reasonably think fit.
