This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of April 9, 2018, is made by and among AMN Healthcare, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), MedPartners HIM, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Company_ "), the owners of the Company set forth on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto (each an " _Owner_ " and collectively, the "
_Owners_ ") and Robert Bradley, individually in his capacity as the
representative of Owners (the " _Owner Representative_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the Owners own all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
of the Company as set forth on _Schedule A_ attached hereto (the "
_Membership Interests_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Owners desire to sell and convey the Membership Interests
to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase the Membership Interests from
the Owners, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "
_Acquisition_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

 

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Membership Interests_. At the Closing, the Owners
shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver the Membership Interests to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase the Membership Interests from the
Owners, free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
defaults of title, encumbrances, hypothecations, mortgages, restrictions,
adverse rights or interests, charges, and other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") and on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

1.2 _Purchase Price_.

(a) As consideration for the Membership Interests and the other rights and
benefits conferred in this Agreement, Purchaser will (i) at the Closing, pay
to the Owners, pro rata in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, in
immediately available funds an amount equal to One Hundred Ninety Five
Million Dollars ($195,000,000), (x) _plus_ (A) the amount by which Estimated
Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target (or _less_ the
amount by which the Net Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital) and (B) the amount of Estimated Closing Cash, _less_ (y) (A)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, (B) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness
of the Company (" _Company Indebtedness_ ") outstanding as of the Closing
Date as set forth on the Estimated Statement (C) the Escrow Amount
(collectively, the " _Closing Purchase Price_ "), and (D) the Owner
Representative Reserve and (ii) pay to the Owners the additional
consideration, if any, determined pursuant to Section 1.4. The Closing
Purchase Price, the additional consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.4
and any remaining amounts of the Escrow Fund paid to the Owners are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_ ".

 



1 (b) _Estimated Statement_. No later than three (3) Business Days before the
Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the
" _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth the following, in each case as of the
Measurement Time, (i) the Companys good faith estimate of the Net
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Companys
good faith estimate of the Company Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Company
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Companys good faith estimate of the Transaction
Expenses that have not been paid by the Owners or the Company as of the
Closing Date (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (iv) the Companys
good faith estimate of the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ")
and (v) an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Measurement Time.

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall:

(i) deposit or cause to be deposited into an account or accounts designated in
writing (prior to Closing) by the Owner Representative, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to the Closing Purchase
Price and the Owner Representative Reserve;

 

(ii) repay, or cause to be repaid, all of the Company Indebtedness set forth
on the Estimated Statement (other than capital leases) in accordance with any
payoff letters executed by the applicable lender with respect thereto and
delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.2, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in such
payoff letters;

(iii) shall pay, or cause to be paid, the unpaid Transaction Expenses by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) specified in the
Estimated Statement;

(iv) pay to the Escrow Agent the Adjustment Escrow Amount for the sole
purpose of securing payment of any amount payable to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.3. The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held and released in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the provisions of Section 1.3(d);

 

(v) pay to the Escrow Agent the Tax Escrow Amount for the sole purpose of
securing payment of any amount payable to Purchaser pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(iv), which Tax Escrow Amount shall be held and released in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement; and

 

(vi) pay to the Escrow Agent the Indemnity Escrow Amount for the purpose of
securing payment of (A) Purchasers right to indemnification under ARTICLE
VIII, and (B) any amount payable to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.3(d)
(solely in the event that the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay
any such amounts due to Purchaser thereunder). On the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall release any remaining amount of the Escrow Fund less (x)
any remaining amounts of the Tax Escrow Amount and (y) amounts that would be
necessary to satisfy any then pending and unsatisfied or unresolved claims
made in good faith by Purchaser on the Escrow Fund under ARTICLE VIII, in
immediately available funds, to the Owners. Promptly after all claims against
the Escrow Fund have been resolved, the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund
shall be paid to the Owners, except for the Tax Escrow Amount, which shall be
held and released in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 



2 1.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Owners (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the Measurement
Time, prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) a statement of the
Net Working Capital, the Company Indebtedness, Closing Cash and the
Transaction Expenses as of the Measurement Time, prepared in accordance with
the Net Working Capital Principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ (together with the
balance sheet referred to in clause (i) above, the " _Closing Statement_ ").

(b) _Review_. After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Owners shall have
twenty (20) Business Days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, upon reasonable advance notice delivered
to Purchaser, the Owner Representative and its representatives shall have full
access to the books and records of the Company or Purchaser, the work papers
prepared by Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Representatives, and the
appropriate personnel (as reasonably requested by the Owner Representative),
to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statement and to such
historical financial information relating to the Closing Statement as the
Owner Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
Closing Statement and to prepare a Closing Statement Dispute Notice (defined
below).

 

(c) _Disputes_. Unless disputed by the Owner Representative in accordance with
this Section 1.3(c), the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be and shall be
final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and the Owners. The Owner
Representative may dispute the amounts initially reflected on the Closing
Statement by delivering a written notice (the " _Closing Statement
Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser within the Review Period setting forth in
reasonable detail the specific line items being disputed and the amounts
thereof. If the Owner Representative timely delivers a Closing Statement
Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Owner Representative shall meet and confer
and attempt to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the
dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement
Dispute Notice, the claim shall be submitted to, and determined by a mutually
acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). If issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting
Firm for resolution, (i) each party shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
resolve any such disputes and make its determinations within thirty (30) days
of such submission, (ii) each party shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Accounting Firm may request and are available to that party, and
shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any
material relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with
the Accounting Firm; (iii) the determination by the Accounting Firm of any
disputed items as set forth in a notice delivered to the parties by the
Accounting Firm will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, absent
manifest error; (iv) the determination of each amount of the items in dispute
shall be no less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either Purchaser or
the Owner Representative, and shall be no greater than the greater of the
amount claimed by either Purchaser or the Owner Representative; and (v) the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm

 



3  for such determination shall be paid by the parties based upon the degree to
which the Accounting Firm accepts the respective positions of the parties. The
degree to which such positions are upheld will be determined by comparing (x)
the difference between the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.3 and the Purchase Price as calculated on the Closing Statement
assuming all of the positions asserted by Purchaser had been upheld in their
entirety by the Accounting Firm and (y) the difference between the Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.3 and the Purchase
Price as calculated on the Closing Statement Dispute Notice assuming all of
the positions asserted by the Owners had been upheld in their entirety by the
Accounting Firm. By way of illustration, (A) if Purchasers calculations would
have resulted in a $500,000 net payment to Purchaser, the Owners
calculations would have resulted in a $500,000 net payment to the Owners from
Purchaser and the Accounting Firms final determination results in an
aggregate net payment of $250,000 to the Owners under Section 1.3,
Purchaser and the Owners shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees
and expenses and (B) if each of such parties calculation differs from the
Independent Firms calculation by the same amount, Purchaser and the Owners
shall split such fees and expenses evenly. The Accounting Firm shall act as
expert and not as arbitrator.

(d) _Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days of the determination, in
accordance with Sections 1.3(a) and (b) above, of the final Closing Statement
(the " _Final Statement_ "), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) If the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final Statement is less than
the Estimated Net Working Capital by at least $150,000, then the Escrow Agent
shall release to Purchaser the amount of the entire shortfall from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the Working Capital reflected
on the Final Statement is greater than the Estimated Working Capital by at
least $150,000, then Purchaser shall pay to the Owners, pro rata in accordance
with their Pro Rata Share, such entire surplus. For the avoidance of doubt, in
all other cases there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
resulting from the calculation of Net Working Capital.

(ii) If the Company Indebtedness reflected on the Final Statement exceeds
the Estimated Company Indebtedness, then the Escrow Agent shall release to
Purchaser the amount of the entire surplus from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. If the Company Indebtedness reflected on the Final
Statement is less than the Estimated Company Indebtedness, then Purchaser
shall pay to the Owners, pro rata in accordance with their Pro Rata Share,
such entire shortfall.

 

(iii) If the Transaction Expenses reflected on the Final Statement exceed the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Escrow Agent shall release to
Purchaser the amount of the entire surplus from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. If the Transaction Expenses reflected on the Final
Statement is less than the Estimated Transaction Expenses, then Purchaser
shall pay to the Owners, pro rata in accordance with their Pro Rata Share,
such entire shortfall.

(iv) If the Closing Cash reflected on the Final Statement is less than the
Estimated Closing Cash, then the Escrow Agent shall release to Purchaser the
amount of the entire shortfall from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. If 

 



4  the Closing Cash reflected on the Final Statement is greater than the
Estimated Closing Cash, then Purchaser shall pay to the Owners, pro rata in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share, such entire surplus.

(v) Any amounts payable to Purchaser or the Owners pursuant to this Section
1.3 shall be paid net of one another (such net amount, the " _Net Adjustment
Amount_ ") in a single payment. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) if the Net
Adjustment Amount is in Purchasers favor and such amount is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be simultaneously released to the Owners, (B) if the Net
Adjustment Amount is in Purchasers favor, and is greater than the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, then Purchaser shall have the option, but not the obligation,
to have the Escrow Agent release to Purchaser such excess amount from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount to pay such additional amounts in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser in its sole discretion may elect
to receive payment for such additional amount above the Adjustment Escrow
Amount directly from the Owners or offset such amounts owed against the Earn
Out Payments (if any) pursuant to Section 1.4(d) and (C) if the Net
Adjustment Amount is in the Owners favor, or is zero, then the entire
Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be released to the Owners.

 

1.4 _Additional Consideration_.

 

(a) _Gross Profit Calculation_.

 

(i) On or before March 15, 2019, Purchaser shall deliver to the Owner
Representative a calculation (" _First Gross Profit Calculation_ ") setting
forth the Gross Profit and Gross Margin for the twelve (12) month period
ending December 31, 2018 (the " _First Measurement Period_ "), together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The First Gross Profit
Calculation shall be prepared and calculated in good faith and shall be based
upon the books and records of Purchaser and Purchasers audited consolidated
financial statements, which shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(and any exception to GAAP set forth in the definition of Gross Profit).

(ii) On or September 15, 2019, Purchaser shall deliver to the Owner
Representative a calculation (" _Second Gross Profit Calculation_ ") setting
forth the Gross Profit and Gross Margin for the six (6) month period
ending June 30, 2019 (the " _Second Measurement Period_ "), together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The Second Gross Profit
Calculation shall be prepared and calculated in good faith and shall be based
upon the books and records of Purchaser and Purchasers unaudited
consolidated financial statements, which shall have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (and any exception to GAAP set forth in the definition of
Gross Profit).

 

(b) _Mechanics and Disputes_. Each of the First Gross Profit Calculation and
Second Gross Profit Calculation shall be conclusive and binding for purposes
of this Agreement unless, within twenty (20) Business Days after Purchasers
delivery of the First Gross Profit Calculation or Second Gross Profit
Calculation, as applicable (each, a " _Response Period_ "), the Owner
Representative shall have delivered written notice to Purchaser of any dispute
or

 



5  disagreement with such calculation (an " _Earn Out Dispute Notice_ "). An
Earn Out Dispute Notice shall state the basis for the objection and shall be
accompanied by the Owners alternative preparation of such calculation and
set forth in reasonable detail the Owners calculation of the First Gross
Profit Calculation or Second Gross Profit Calculation, as applicable. During
each Response Period, upon reasonable advance notice delivered to Purchaser,
the Owner Representative and its Representatives shall be granted reasonable
access, during normal business hours and subject to customary confidentiality
provisions, to reasonably requested accounting records of Purchaser or the
Company, the work papers prepared by Purchaser and/or its Representatives and
the appropriate personnel (as reasonably requested by the Owner
Representative), in order to verify the amounts set forth in the First Gross
Profit Calculation or Second Gross Profit Calculation, as applicable. If the
Owner Representative timely delivers an Earn Out Dispute Notice to Purchaser,
Purchaser and the Owner Representative shall meet and confer and attempt to
resolve the dispute. If the Owner Representative and Purchaser are unable to
resolve such dispute or disagreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by
Purchaser of such Dispute Notice, either the Owner Representative or Purchaser
may submit such dispute or disagreement for final determination to Accounting
Firm in accordance with Section 1.3(b), which shall apply mutatis mutandis.

(c)  _Earn Out Payments_ _._ Within five (5) Business Days of the final and
binding determination of the First Gross Profit Calculation or the Second
Gross Profit Calculation, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 1.4(a) and
1.4(b), and if such applicable Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin reach the
applicable thresholds set forth in the definition of the First Earn Out
Payment or Second Earn Out Payment, as applicable, then Purchaser shall pay to
the Owners by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of such
applicable Earn Out Payment, pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares.

 

(d) _Offset_. Notwithstanding any other provision, Purchaser may offset any
payment owed to the Owners pursuant to Section 1.4(c) by amounts payable to
Purchaser pursuant to (i) Section 1.3(d)(v)(B), only to the extent such amount
payable pursuant to Section 1.3(c) has been finally determined in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.3(b) or (ii) the indemnification obligations
of the Owners as provided in Section 8.9. Purchaser will give Owner
Representative written notice of Purchasers intent to make such offset from
any such payment at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such offset and
describe the basis for such offset (" _Offset Notice_ "). If Owner
Representative wants to dispute any offset or indemnification obligation
described in an Offset Notice, it shall submit written notice to
Purchaser setting forth with particularity the basis of such dispute ("
_Offset Dispute Notice_ ") within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the
Offset Notice. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within
ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of the Offset Dispute Notice, as
promptly as practicable thereafter Purchaser shall deposit cash in an amount
equal to the amount it intends to offset into an escrow account with the
Escrow Agent. All funds so deposited will be held in escrow, and shall only
be released upon (i) joint written instructions from Purchaser and Owner
Representative or (ii) upon the delivery to the Escrow Agent of a final non-
appealable order from a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Owner Representative will not dispute an Offset Notice if it
reflects a dollar amount for (i) an indemnification obligation that has been
determined to be owed by Owners, including the dollar amount of such
indemnification obligation, pursuant to a judicial ruling, (ii) any amount
that Owner Representative has agreed that Owners are responsible to indemnify
under Article VIII (both as to the indemnification

 



6  obligation and the dollar amount), (iii) any amount that has been
conclusively established to be owed to Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.4(c) or
(iv) any amount that has been finally determined pursuant to Section 1.3.

(e) The Owners acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall have the complete right, power and authority to operate and
control the Company Business and operations in any manner as it shall
determine in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to the provisions in
this Section 1.4(e). Purchaser owes no fiduciary duty to the Owners with
respect to the operation of the Company or Purchaser or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing and through the end of
the Second Measurement Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, (i) keep the Company Business books and records in a
manner that will facilitate the recording, compiling and analysis of all
information relevant to the determination and calculation of the Earn Out
Payments, Revenue and Gross Profit, (ii) not take any action with the primary
purpose of reducing the Earn Out Payments, (iii) operate the Company Business
in good faith and (iv) provide Owner Representative with quarterly statements
of the financial performance of the Company Business, including the Gross
Profit and Gross Profit Margin as of the date of such statements, to be
delivered the later of (A) ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser publicly
releases its earnings and (B) forty five (45) days after the end of such
calendar quarter.

(f) The parties understand and agree that (A) the contingent right to receive
the Earn Out Payments shall not be represented by any form of certificate or
other instrument, is not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to
descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and does not
constitute an equity or ownership interest in Purchaser or the Company, (B)
the Owners shall not have any rights as a securityholder of Purchaser or the
Company as a result of the Owners contingent right to receive the Earn Out
Payments, and (C) no interest is payable with respect to the Earn Out
Payments or any other payment due to the Owners pursuant to this Agreement.

 

1.5 _Closing_.

(a) The closing of the Acquisition (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
the offices of Alston and Bird LLP, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia
30309 (i) on the date most promptly practicable following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those
conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), but in
no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day following such date or (ii)
at such other place and time and/or on such other date as Purchaser and the
Owners may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be
effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date.

(b) All deliveries, payments and other transactions and documents relating to
the Closing (i) shall be independent and shall not be effective unless and
until all are effective (except to the extent that the party entitled to the
benefit thereof has waived satisfaction or performance thereof as a condition
precedent to the Closing), and (ii) shall be deemed to be consummated
simultaneously.

 



7 1.6 _Tax Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser
reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payments under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local
or foreign Tax Law and instead shall pay such amount to the applicable
Governmental Authority. Before making any such deduction or withholding,
Purchaser shall give the Owner Representative advance notice of at least three
(3) Business Days of its intention to make such deduction or withholding in
order for the Owner Representative to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. Such amounts deducted and withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser.

thereto is exempt from taxation under 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred nor

 



15  any conditions exist with respect to such Benefit Plan that could reasonably
be expected to cause the revocation of such determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or the unavailability of reliance on such opinion
letter from the Internal Revenue Service.

(a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Nevada. Purchaser is duly qualified
as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing (to the extent
applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties, rights and assets and to carry on its business as it has been
and is now being conducted.

4.2 _Authorization and Validity_. Purchaser has the full power and authority
necessary to execute and deliver the Acquisition Documents, to perform its
obligations under the Acquisition Documents and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of the Acquisition
Documents by Purchaser and the consummation of the Transactions by Purchaser
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Purchaser, and no other proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to
authorize Purchasers execution, delivery, and performance of the Acquisition
Documents or consummation of the Transactions. The Acquisition Documents have
been or will be, as the case may be, duly and validly executed and delivered
by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by each other party thereto, constitute or will constitute a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance
with their respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by
general equitable principles.

4.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the Acquisition
Documents do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i)
conflict with or violate

 



27  the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section
4.3(b) have been obtained or taken and all filings and obligations described
in Section 4.3(b) have been made or fulfilled, conflict with or violate any
Law or Order applicable to Purchaser or by which Purchaser or any of its
properties or assets is bound, (iii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 4.3(b) have been
obtained or taken and all filings and obligations described in Section 4.3(b)
have been made or fulfilled, conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination, amendment, or acceleration of any
material contract, agreement, instrument, license or permit applicable to
Purchaser or by which any of its properties or assets is bound.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the
Acquisition Documents do not, and the consummation of the Transactions by
Purchaser will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or any other
Person, other than applicable requirements under the HSR Act.

4.4  _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser, or Orders binding on Purchaser or any
of its properties or assets, in each case that would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.5 _Brokers_. Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, neither Purchaser, nor any of its officers, directors or employees
has employed any broker, finder or investment banker or incurred any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions.

 

4.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the Acquisition and the
other Transactions, neither Purchaser nor the Company will (i) be insolvent
(either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is
greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable
value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts as they mature), (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business, or (iii) have
incurred debts or obligations beyond its ability to pay them in the Ordinary
Course of Business as they become due.

sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the
Purchase Price and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.8  _Restricted Securities_. Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Interests
for its own account, with the intention of holding the Membership Interests
for investment and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part
of the Membership Interests, and Purchaser does not have any present
intention of selling, granting any participation in or otherwise distributing
the Membership Interests. Purchaser understands that the Membership Interests
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by
reason of specific exemptions from the registration provisions, which depend
upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and
the accuracy of Purchasers representations as expressed in this Agreement.
Purchaser understands that the Membership Interests are "restricted
securities"

 



28  under applicable U.S. federal and state securities Laws and that, pursuant
to these Laws, Purchaser must hold the Membership Interests indefinitely
unless they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
qualified by state authorities or an exemption from such registration and
qualification requirements is available.

 

4.9 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties set forth in this ARTICLE IV, neither Purchaser nor any other
Person has made or makes any other representations or warranties, written or
oral, express or implied, with respect to Purchaser.

 

4.10 _No Reliance_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Owners and the
Company have not made, and are not making, any representations or warranties
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except for those representations and warranties of the Owners and the Company
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Acquisition Documents, and
Purchaser is not relying and has not relied on any other representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied.

Company and to its executive officers, directors, managers, agents, counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and
representatives (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ "), and (ii)
furnish or make available to Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives such
financial and operating data and such other information with respect to the
Company as Purchaser or the Purchaser Representatives may from time to time
reasonably request. Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives shall conduct

unreasonably interfere with, the Companys business and operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any
of the Purchaser Representatives shall contact any employee, officer,
director, independent contractor, supplier, or client of the Company in
connection with any information or matter regarding the Company or its
business, operations or prospects, without the prior written consent of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may withhold (x) any
document or information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party, (y) information that, if disclosed, would
violate an attorney-client or other privilege or would constitute a waiver of
rights as to attorney work product or attorney-client privilege or (z)
information, the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law, such as
portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters that
are highly sensitive, if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof)
or information, as determined by the Companys legal counsel, might reasonably
result in antitrust compliance questions for such party (or any of its
Affiliates). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
preceding sentence, it shall inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what
is being withheld. Except as otherwise agreed to by the Company, and
notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of November 7, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Purchaser and P2P Staffing Corporation
(" _P2P_ ") shall apply to all information furnished to Purchaser or any
Purchaser Representative by any Company Representative under this Agreement.

press releases by any party hereto or any of its Affiliates regarding the

manner of distribution) by each of Purchaser and the Owner Representative,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , that Purchaser may issue a press release or make a public
announcement or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission without the
approval of the Owner Representative to the extent necessary for Purchaser or
its Affiliates to comply with applicable securities Laws or New York Stock
Exchange rules. Purchaser shall provide a copy to the Owner Representative of
any such press release or announcement that is to be issued or made prior
to the Closing in advance of its release such as to provide the Owner
Representative a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such press
release or announcement, and Purchaser shall consider any such comments by
Owner Representative in good faith.

5.6 _No Shop_. Until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Owner shall, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, manager, employee, Affiliate, agent,
intermediary or representative of an Owner or the Company: (a) solicit,
initiate or encourage submission of proposals or offers from any
Person relating to any purchase of the Companys assets, other than any
purchase of assets in the Ordinary Course of Business or any purchase of
immaterial assets, or any equity securities or any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, reclassification or
other similar transaction involving the Company (an " _Acquisition Proposal_
"); (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise respond to,
cooperate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any other
transaction that would have the effect of preventing or limiting the
Acquisition. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day of learning of the relevant information) notify Purchaser if any Person
makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the
foregoing, together with the material details of such proposal, offer, inquiry
or contact, and, to the extent not prohibited by any confidentiality
obligations existing as of the date of this Agreement, the identity of the
potential purchaser.

5.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All equity transfer, sales, use, excise, controlling interest, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Transactions (regardless of the Person on whom
such Transfer Taxes are imposed by Law) shall be paid one-half by Purchaser
and one-half by the Owners when due, and each party to this Agreement shall
cooperate with the other parties in preparing, executing and filing any
Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(b) The Owners, at their sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for
taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
Period_") and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes required to be paid
with respect to such Tax Returns (the " _Owner Returns_ ") except to the
extent that such Taxes have been taken into account in the calculation of the
Net

 



33  Adjustment Amount. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with applicable Law and, to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing,
the prior practice of the Company. With respect to each Owner Return that has
not been filed on or prior to the Closing Date, the Owner Representative shall
provide Purchaser with a completed draft copy of each such Owner Return for
Purchasers review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for filing thereof and shall make such revisions
to the Owner Returns as are reasonably requested in good faith by Purchaser
and shall not file any Owner Return without Purchasers prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

(c) Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for
all taxable periods commencing after the Closing Date and for any Straddle
Period. Any such Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period (" _Straddle
Period Return_ _)_ " shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior
practice of the Company, unless otherwise required under applicable Law.
Purchaser shall provide the Owner Representative with completed drafts of
such Straddle Period Returns for the Owner Representatives review and comment
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing thereof and shall
make such revisions to such Straddle Period Returns as are reasonably
requested by the Owner Representative. The Owners agree to provide Purchaser
with such information as is necessary or appropriate to permit Purchaser to
fulfill its Tax Return filing requirements under this Section 5.7(c),
and Purchaser agrees to provide the Owners with such information regarding
any Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period as the Owner Representative
may reasonably request.

 

(d) If the Company is permitted but not required under applicable Law to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the Parties hereto
shall cause the Company, as applicable, to elect to (or otherwise) treat the
Closing Date as the last day of such taxable period. The Owners shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and
against, any Tax with respect to the Company that is attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period or to that portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that the Owners shall have no responsibility for
any Taxes from any transaction occurring on the Closing Date outside the
Ordinary Course of Business. For purposes of this Section 5.7, in the case of
any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income,
gross or net sales, payroll, payments or receipts of the Company for the Pre-
Closing Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as
of the close of business on the Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes
of the Company for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. Also for purposes of
this Section 5.7, any responsibility for Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing
Period or that portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date
shall be determined by taking into account all deductions arising in
connection with the Transactions that are properly deductible prior to
Closing (assuming, for this purpose, that the safe harbor election provided
for in IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-29 is made with respect to any such
deduction that constitutes a "success-based fee" and that a rule similar to
the "next-day rule" contained in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)is not applicable to any such deduction).

 



34 (e) Except to the extent reflected as an asset in the calculation of the Net
Adjustment Amount, the Owners shall be entitled to any refund or credit of
Taxes attributable to the Company for any Pre-Closing Period or to that
portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
pay to such Owners any such refund or credit within fifteen (15) days after
receipt or entitlement thereto by Purchaser. Purchaser shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to secure any such refund or credit, including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall have the
right to offset out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in securing any such
refund or credit.

 

(f) The parties shall provide each other, at the expense of the requesting
party, with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any Governmental Authority, or any Actions relating to
Liability for Taxes, and each will retain for the applicable statute of
limitation and provide to the requesting party any records or information
that may be relevant to any of the foregoing. The Owners will have the right
to control, at their own expense, any Actions relating to Liability for income
Taxes for the Company solely for a Pre-Closing Period, including any
disposition of such Action; _provided_ , that Purchaser will have the right,
directly or through its designated representatives, to participate in any such
Action and (whether or not Purchaser elects to participate) to review in
advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of any such Action
(including any administrative appeals thereof), and Purchasers consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required
for any settlement by the Owners. The provisions of this Section 5.7(f) shall
take priority over the comparable provisions contained in ARTICLE VIII. The
Company shall have the right to control all other Actions relating to
Liability for Taxes for the Company.

(g) In accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6 ( _Situation 2_ ), the transfer of
the Membership Interests by the Owners to Purchaser will be treated for
federal income tax purposes: (i) for the Owners, as a sale of partnership
interests; and (ii) for Purchaser, as a purchase of all the assets of the
Company immediately following a liquidating distribution of all the Company
assets to the Owners. The Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement and as increased by the amounts treated as assumed liabilities of
the Company for federal income tax purposes and other amounts treated as
taxable sales consideration for federal income tax purposes) shall be
allocated to the assets of the Company for all tax purposes in accordance
with their respective fair market values pursuant to an allocation schedule to
be prepared by Purchaser after the Closing in accordance with the applicable
principles of Sections 743(b), 755 and 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto (the "Asset Allocation").
Within sixty (60) days after final determination of the Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 1.3, Purchaser shall deliver a copy of its initial
determination of the Asset Allocation to the Owner Representative. The Owner
Representative shall, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the initial
determination of the Asset Allocation, notify Purchaser if the Owner
Representative disagrees with such initial determination, and if the Owner
Representative does not so notify Purchaser within such twenty (20) days, the
initial Asset Allocation shall be final and binding on the parties. If the
Owner Representative disagrees with such initial Asset Allocation, Purchaser
and the Owner Representative shall make a good faith effort to resolve the
dispute. If Purchaser and the Owner Representative have been unable to resolve
their differences within twenty (20) days after Purchaser has been notified
of the Owner Representatives disagreement with the initial Asset Allocation,
then any remaining disputed issues shall be submitted to the Accounting

 



35  Firm, who shall resolve the disagreement in a final binding manner in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 1.3(b);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Firm shall adopt either the position of the Owners on the one hand or
Purchaser on the other. The fees of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Owners, on the other hand, in such
amounts as shall be determined by the Accounting Firm based on the proportion
that the aggregate amount of disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm
that is unsuccessfully disputed by Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Owners,
on the other hand, as determined by the Accounting Firm, bears to the total
amount of such disputed items so referred to the Accounting Firm for
resolution. Purchaser and the Owner Representative will prepare all tax books,
records, and filings in a manner consistent with the Asset Allocation (as
determined pursuant to this Section 5.7(g)) and will not take any action
inconsistent therewith with respect to tax matters.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following the Closing,
each of Purchaser, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates and
agents shall have the right to contact state and local taxing authorities ("
_Taxing Authorities_ ") in each of the jurisdictions listed on _Schedule
5.7(h)_ (each, an " _Identified State_ ") and enter into a "voluntary
disclosure agreement", amnesty program, or other similar program with any such
Taxing Authority relating to sales or use taxes (or any analogous state or
local Taxes) attributable to a Pre-Closing Period (each, a " _VDA Proceeding_
"). The Owner Representative shall have the right to control any process or
proceeding (including the amendment, preparation and filing of sales or use
Tax Returns and all other Tax Returns as required by the relevant Taxing
Authorities) relating to any VDA Proceeding; provided, however, (i) Purchaser
shall have the right (but not the duty) to (A) participate in any VDA
Proceeding, (B) attend any meetings or conferences with any Taxing Authority
relating to a VDA Proceeding, (C) consult with the Owner Representative
concerning the conduct of a VDA Proceeding, and (D) employ counsel, solely at
its own expense, (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the submission of
any letters, documents or calculations to a Taxing Authority in connection
with a VDA Proceeding, the Owner Representative shall provide Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any such materials prepared or furnished
in connection with a VDA Proceeding prior to its submission and shall consider
in good faith any comments made by Purchaser with respect thereto, (iii) the
Owner Representative shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the status
of any VDA Proceeding, and (iv) the Owner Representative shall not settle or
compromise any such VDA Proceeding without the Purchasers prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amendment,
preparation and filing of any sales or use Tax Return and any other Tax
Returns required to be filed pursuant to a VDA Proceeding, shall be
governed by this Section 5.7(h). For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts due
to a Taxing Authority pursuant to a VDA Proceeding shall be considered an
Indemnified Tax subject to indemnification by the Owners. Except as provided
in this Section 5.7(h), Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company not
to, contact any Taxing Authority to voluntarily disclose any liability with
respect to, or enter into a VDA Proceeding with respect to, any Tax Returns or
Taxes for which the Owners are responsible under this Agreement as
Indemnified Taxes without the written consent of the Owner Representative,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be prohibited from making
any disclosures required by applicable Law. 

 



36 5.8 _Manager and Officer Indemnification_. For a period of six (6) years after
the Closing Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Purchaser
shall not, and shall not permit the Company to amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Organizational Documents of the Company relating to the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to any of its
current or former officers or managers (the " _M andO Indemnified Parties_"), it
being the intent of the parties that the MandO Indemnified Parties shall
continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses to the fullest extent of the Law. If Purchaser, the Company or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser, the Company shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each MandO Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

 

5.9 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser will obtain a binding buy-side representation and
warranty insurance policy in form and substance as attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_"). Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not
cancel, modify or waive the RandW Insurance Policy (to the extent that any such
cancellation, modification or waiver adversely affects any Owner), without the
consent of the Owner Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The cost of the premiums together with all taxes and
application, underwriting or similar other fees or expenses (the " _R andW
Premium_") in connection with obtaining and maintaining the RandW Insurance
Policy shall be borne Fifty Percent (50%) by Purchaser and Fifty Percent
(50%) by the Company, with the Companys share being deemed a Transaction
Expense.

5.10  _Release_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each Owner, on behalf of itself and each of
its Related Persons, does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably release,
waive and forever discharge the Company and Purchaser, and their respective
Related Persons (the " _Purchaser Released Parties_ "), of and from any and
all known and unknown claims, actions, causes of action, suits, debts, liens,
contracts, agreements, promises, commitments, demands, charges, damages,
awards, assessments, losses, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and
costs), and other liabilities and obligations that such Owner or any of its
Related Persons may now or henceforth have against the Purchaser Released
Parties, of any nature or kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
from whatever cause, action, omission, or other matter or circumstance,
from the beginning of time to and through the Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, that no release is given hereunder with respect to (i) such Owners rights,
if any, to accrued but unpaid compensation as reflected in the Net
Working Capital, (ii) such Owners rights under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
(iii) such Owners rights in his or her capacity as a director, manager or
officer (A) for indemnification under and in accordance with any
indemnification provisions in the Organizational Documents of the Company or
any indemnification agreements with the Company or (B) under and in accordance
with any directors and officers insurance policy (or any "tail" policy
thereof) against which such Owner is entitled to make a claim.

 



37 (b) It is each Owners intention that Section 5.10(a) shall be effective as a
full and final accord and satisfactory release of each and every matter
specifically or generally referred to in such section. Each Owner acknowledges
that it is aware that it may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition or
different from those he now knows or believes to be true with respect to the
matters released in Section 5.10(a). Nevertheless, it is the intention of each
Owner to fully, finally and forever settle and release all such matters, and
all claims relative thereto, which do now exist, may exist, or heretofore
have existed. In furtherance of such intention, Section 5.10(a) shall be and
remain in effect as a full and complete general release of all such matters,
notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any additional or different
claims or facts relative thereto. Each Owner acknowledges that the applicable
laws of many states provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE
DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO
EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN
BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR." Each Owner acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect
a party from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist.
Nonetheless, each Owner agrees that, effective as of the Closing, it shall be
deemed to waive any such provision.

 

(c) Each Owner expressly covenants not to (i) sue the Purchaser Released
Parties to enforce any charge, claim or cause of action released pursuant to
Section 5.10(a), (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in any such
proceeding, or (iii) encourage, assist and/or solicit any third party to
institute any such proceeding. This covenant not to bring or maintain any
action in law or equity shall be subject to specific enforcement. The
Purchaser Released Parties are third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10.

 

5.11 _Transition Services Agreement_. At the Closing, Purchaser, the Company
and P2P shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement, in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ B_, which shall provide for
certain transition services to be provided by P2P to the Company upon the
terms and conditions set forth therein.

 

5.12 _N_ _ame Change_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Closing, the Owners shall take all actions and make
all filings necessary to change, as promptly as possible but in no event
later than the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (the "
_Transition Period_ "), the names of MedPartners Locum Tenens, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _MedPartners_ _ LT_ "), MedPartners LT Holdings,
Inc., a Florida corporation, and any other entity controlled by the Owners
including the name "MedPartners" in their titles to remove any reference to
the name "MedPartners" in their titles and to cease using the name
"MedPartners" in their business. Except as provided for the use of the name
MedPartners LT during the Transition Period as contemplated by this Section
5.12, the Owners acknowledge and agree that no Owner nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any rights in or to the name "MedPartners" or
any Mark in "MedPartners" following the Closing.

 



38 (b) Following the Closing, Purchaser agrees, and shall cause its subsidiaries,
not to use the name "MedPartners Locum Tenens" in their businesses prior to
the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date.

5.13 _Tail Coverage_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company, at its sole
cost and expense, shall have purchased tail coverage for the insurance
policies set forth on _Schedule 5.13_.

 

5.14 _Certain Bonuses_. Purchaser agrees that it shall cause the Company to
pay the bonus set forth on _Schedule 5.14_ , which shall be considered a
Transaction Expense (and therefore be deducted from the Purchase Price),
through the normal course payroll of the Company as promptly as possible
following the Closing.

 

5.15 _Landlord Consent_. Sellers shall cooperate in good faith with Purchaser
in obtaining any consents required under the lease of the Leased Real
Property.

8.4 _Notice and Defense of Claims_. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII is referred to herein as the "
_Indemnified Party_ " and the party against whom such claim for
indemnification is asserted under this ARTICLE VIII is referred to herein as
the " _Indemnifying Party_."All claims for indemnification under this
ARTICLE VIII will be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If the Indemnified Party becomes aware of a claim
being asserted by a Third Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that the
Indemnified Party believes may result in a demand pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
control the defense of any Third Party Claim (other than any Third Party Claim
relating to Indemnified Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 5.7), with
its own counsel and at its own expense (which expenses, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall be considered Losses to the extent that an Indemnified Party is
or would be (if finally resolved pursuant to Section 8.3(c)) entitled to
indemnification in respect of such Third Party Claim); _provided however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate, with its own
counsel and at its own cost and expense, in the defense of any Third Party
Claim that is the subject of a notice given by an Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Section 8.4(a); _provided, further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall
not be entitled to enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement,
compromise or consent to entry of judgment requires payment by any one or more
Owners of amounts that, in the aggregate with all other indemnifiable Losses
arising from Third Party Claims settled or compromised by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 8.4(a), exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, in case any one or more Owners is the Indemnifying Party, or the
payment of funds, in case Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party, or involves any
finding or admission of any violation of any Law or admission of wrongdoing by
the Indemnifying Party. A party shall only be liable for indemnification of a
Third Party Claim by agreement of such party or otherwise pursuant to Section
8.4(c) and any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgement entered into by an Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim shall not conclusively establish whether Losses were
incurred with respect to such Third Party Claim for which indemnification is
required hereunder or the amount of indemnifiable Losses.

 



45 (b) _Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event the Indemnified Party has a claim
hereunder that does not involve a claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected by a Third Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness send written notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying
Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim.

(c) If, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the Indemnifying Party
receives notice in accordance with Section 8.04(a) or (b), the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying
Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case the
Indemnifying Party shall timely object in writing to any claim made in
accordance with Section 8.04(a) or (b), the Indemnified Party shall have
fifteen (15) calendar days to respond in a written statement to the objection
of the Indemnifying Party. If after such fifteen (15) calendar day period
there remains a dispute as to any claim, the parties shall attempt in good
faith for thirty (30) calendar days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to such claim. If the parties should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by
both parties. If the parties do not so agree, the parties will resolve the
conflict in accordance with Section 9.9.

(d) _Notice of Claims_. The Indemnified Partys failure to give reasonably
prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any actual, threatened or
possible claim or demand that may give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party unless the failure to
give such written notice materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

 

8.5 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Closing Date, a Purchaser Indemnified Party will not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to subparts (i) and (vii) of Section 8.2(a) until the
aggregate of all the amounts due to Purchaser Group exceeds One Million
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,075,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), in which
case Purchaser Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover Losses suffered
only to the extent in excess of the Deductible; _provided, however_ , that any
Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any of the
following shall not be subject to the Deductible: (i) the Companys or an
Owners breach of, or any inaccuracy contained in, the Fundamental
Representations or (ii) fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of an Owner or the Company.

For avoidance of doubt, the Deductible and Indemnification Limit do not apply
to claims for indemnification pursuant to subparts (ii), (iii) or (iv)

no way limit the amounts Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover under the

indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser
shall not be required to, and it shall not be required to cause the Company
to, initiate or pursue any legal action to make any such recovery and
_provided further_ that in no event shall Purchasers obligations under this
sentence act as a bar to bringing an indemnification claim against the Owners.
To the extent that Purchaser or the Company receives any amount under
insurance coverage with respect to a matter for which a Purchaser Indemnified
Party has previously obtained payment in indemnification under this ARTICLE
VIII, Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
insurance proceeds, pay and reimburse to the Owners (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share), for any prior indemnification payment up to the
amount of the insurance proceeds, but less (i) the cost and expense of
pursuing such insurance recovery, (ii) the deductible associated therewith
and (iii) the amount of all retro-premium obligations and reasonably
anticipated premium increases resulting from such recovery (other than
premiums under the RandW Insurance Policy). For purposes of this Section 8.5(d),
the term insurance proceeds shall in all respects include the proceeds
received under or pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy.

(e) The indemnification rights provided in this ARTICLE VIII constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties following Closing with respect to any
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, other than (i) claims
based on actual fraud, (ii) the remedy of specific performance provided by
Section 9.14 and other equitable remedies, or (iii) as provided by Section 1.3
with respect to the Net Adjustment Amount.

 

8.6 _Additional Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the parties shall be liable to the other, whether in contract, tort
or otherwise, for any punitive damages that in any way arise out of, or relate
to, or are a consequence of, its performance or nonperformance under the
Acquisition Documents, except to the extent to which a third party

47 (b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any Losses to the extent such Losses are accrued or otherwise reflected in
the Net Adjustment Amount.

8.7 _Fraud_. None of the limitations contained in this ARTICLE VIII shall
apply to actual fraud.

8.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses indemnifiable under this ARTICLE VIII, including pursuing
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy.

8.9 _Right of Offset_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein,
Purchaser may at any time withhold and set off against amounts otherwise
payable under this Agreement that amount payable by the Owners to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to any section of this ARTICLE VIII in accordance
with Section 1.4(d).

 

8.10 _Materiality; Net Losses; No Subrogation; Access to Information; No
Contributions_.

 

(a) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising out of or resulting from any breach
of a representation or warranty contained herein and for purposes of
determining the existence of a breach, references to Material Adverse Effect
or materiality (or other similar terms) shall be disregarded.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be subrogated to any rights of the
Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates), against any Third Party in respect of
any Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party.

(c) Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, Purchaser
shall afford the Owner Representative reasonable access to the books and

as would be required by applicable civil process or applicable discovery
rules.

(d) Each Owner waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Owner will not
in its capacity as an equityholder exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise
or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against the Company in connection with any indemnification or other
rights any party may have under or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement shall be made first from that portion of
the Escrow Fund representing the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all
payments required pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.15 (Taxes) may,
at Purchasers election, be made from that portion of the Escrow Fund

and thereof. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an

obligations, agreements or conditions under this Agreement may be waived by
any other party to whom such compliance is owed only by an agreement in
writing signed by the parties against whom enforcement of such waiver is

thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the state of Delaware or
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.2(c)(i)). Each of the parties hereto agrees
that, subject to rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of
appeal or other avenues of review, a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

 



57  ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

9.11 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to and does
not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or
equitable rights or remedies; _provided_ , that the Company shall have the
right to pursue damages on behalf of an Owner in the event of Purchasers
breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the following Persons
are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries with respect to the
following specified sections of this Agreement and will have the right
to enforce such specified sections against the parties to this Agreement:
with respect to Section 5.9, the MandO Indemnified Parties; with respect Section
9.6, the financial institution(s) or firm(s) providing financing to Purchaser
in connection with this Transaction are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries; with respect to Section 9.13, the Non-Party Affiliates; and
with respect to Section 9.16, Alston and Bird LLP.

9.13 _No Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort, at law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only
against the Persons who are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement.
No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager,
partner, equity holder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any
named party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party __Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement, the Acquisition Documents or
the Transactions or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
this Agreement, the Acquisition Documents or their respective negotiation or
execution, and each party to this Agreement waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party beneficiaries of
this provision of this Agreement.

9.14 _Specific Performance_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this
Agreement shall be cumulative. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that money damages would not
be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, in
addition to and not in limitation of any other remedies available to the
parties to this Agreement for a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement and
an injunction restraining any such party from such breach or threatened
breach. Each of the parties hereto herby waives any defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate in any action for specific performance and any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

 



58 9.15 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
subsections, schedules or exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section,
subsection, schedule or exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural and
any plural term the singular. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation." The word "herein" and similar references
mean, except where a specific Section or ARTICLE reference is expressly
indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any specific Section or ARTICLE.
As used herein, all pronouns shall include the masculine, feminine, neuter,
singular and plural thereof whenever the context and facts require such
construction.

9.16 _Waiver of Conflict; Disposition of Attorney-Client Privilege_. In any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement, any
Owner or the Owner Representative shall have the right, at its election, to
retain the firm of Alston and Bird LLP to represent it in such matter,
and Purchaser, for itself and for its successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably waives, and shall cause the Company to waive, any objection and
consent to any such representation in any such matter. Purchaser acknowledges
that the foregoing provision shall apply regardless of whether Alston and Bird
LLP provides legal services to the Company after the Closing. Purchaser, for
itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications among the Company, the Owners, the Owner
Representative and their counsel, including Alston and Bird LLP, made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing
under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, or any matter relating
to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications among the Company, the
Owners, the Owner Representative and such counsel and after the Closing, the
privilege shall remain within the exclusive control of such Owner or the Owner
Representative, as the case may be. Neither Purchaser, the Company nor any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser or the Company,
will seek to obtain the same by any process. In addition, if the Transactions
are consummated, the Companys privileged records related to the Transactions
will become property of (and be controlled by) the Owners and the Owner
Representative, and Purchaser hereby irrevocably disclaims the right to
assert a waiver by Owners or the Owner Representative with regard to the
attorney-client privilege solely due to the fact that such information is
physically in the possession of the Company after the Closing. Alston and Bird
LLP is an intended beneficiary of this Section 9.16 and is entitled to enforce
such provision.

9.17  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and any one of which may be
delivered by facsimile or as attachments to email.

authority or made such decision or determination in such Owners capacity.

(c) Until notified in writing by the Owners or the Owner Representative that
the Owner Representative has resigned or has been removed in accordance with
Section 9.18(d), each Owner agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on
any action taken (including but not limited to any consent or waiver granted)
by the Owner Representative in his or her capacity as such as the valid and
binding action of the Owners; _provided_ , _that_ , __ such action is
consistent with the powers and authority granted to the Owner Representative
in Section 9.18(a). Neither Purchaser, the Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever in connection with any
apportionment or distribution of payment to the Owners so long as Purchaser
has followed and complied with the provisions of this Agreement.

(d) The Owners shall have the right at any time upon the joint instruction of
all Owners to substitute a new Owner Representative by giving notice to
Purchaser of the substitute Owner Representative. The Owner Representative may
resign and be discharged from his duties hereunder at any time by giving
written notice of such resignation to the Owners specifying a date (not less
than 30 calendar days after giving such notice) when such resignation

 



60  shall take effect and a copy thereof to Purchaser. Any substitute Owner
Representative shall be subject to and only effective upon such substitute
assuming the obligations of the Owner Representative hereunder and agreeing
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Until notified in
writing by the Owner Representative that he or she has resigned or has been
removed in accordance with this Section 9.18(d), Purchaser may rely
conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the
Owner Representative named above and, thereafter, upon the directions,
instructions and notices of any successor named accordance with this Section
9.18(d).

(e) The authorizations of the Owner Representative shall be effective until
his or her rights and obligations under this Agreement terminate by virtue of
the termination of any and all obligations of the Owner Representative and
Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

(f) By executing this Agreement under the heading "Owner Representative,"
Robert Bradley hereby (i) accepts his or her appointment and authorization to
act in his or her capacity as the Owner Representative as attorney-in-fact and
agent on behalf of the Owners in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and (ii) agrees to perform his obligations under, and otherwise comply with,
this Section 9.18.

(g) The Owner Representative shall hold and be entitled to use the Owner
Representative Reserve for the purposes of paying for, or reimbursing the
Owner Representative for, any and all costs and expenses (including
accountants, counsel and legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Owner
Representative in connection with the protection, defense, enforcement or
other exercise or fulfillment of any rights or obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including payment of indemnification
claims) (collectively, the " _Owner Representative Expenses_ "). To the extent
that the Owner Representative Reserve is insufficient to cover the Owner
Representative Expenses, the Owners promptly upon request by the Owner
Representative and in any event within ten (10) days of such request, shall
reimburse the Owner Representative for the Owner Representative Expenses. The
Owner Representative shall hold the Owner Representative Reserve in a
segregated bank account and shall not comingle it with any other funds. At
such time as the Owner Representative deems appropriate, the Owner
Representative shall distribute to the Owners (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share) the remaining Owner Representative Reserve (the "
