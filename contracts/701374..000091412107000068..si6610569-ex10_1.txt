period following Buyer\'s receipt of the Statement of Final Adjustment, Buyer
and its auditors shall be permitted to review the working papers of Sellers
and their auditors relating to such statement. Buyer may dispute the amounts
or items reflected on or omitted from the Statement of Final Adjustment
(each, a "Disputed Item"), but only on the basis that such statement does not
reflect, or has not been prepared in a manner consistent with, the provisions
of this Agreement or otherwise contains a mathematical or factual error;
provided, however, that Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing of each
Disputed Item, and specify the amounts thereof in dispute and the specific
basis therefor, within 20 Business Days after receipt of the Statement of
Final Adjustment. The failure of Buyer to provide a notice of Disputed Items
to Sellers within such 20-Business Day period with respect to any items
reflected on such statement shall constitute Buyer\'s acceptance of all such
items reflected on such statement.   (d) If a notice of Disputed Items shall
be timely delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(c), Sellers and Buyer shall,
during the 20 Business Days following the date of such delivery (the
"Resolution Period"), negotiate to resolve the Disputed Items. If during the
Resolution Period the parties are unable to reach agreement, Sellers and
Buyer shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to Ernst and Young LLP, or any
other independent accounting firm as Sellers and Buyer shall mutually agree
upon (the "Independent Accountant"). Such reference shall be made within 10
Business Days of termination of the Resolution Period, whereupon the
Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to each
unresolved Disputed Item within 20 Business Days after the reference, which
determination shall be made in accordance with this Section 2.3(d). The
Independent Accountant shall deliver to Sellers and Buyer, within such
20-Business Day period, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any,
to the Statement of Final Adjustment and the calculations supporting
such adjustments. Such report shall be final and binding on the parties
and conclusive. Sellers and Buyer shall each pay one-half of all the costs
incurred in connection with the engagement of the Independent Accountant. As
used herein, "Final Adjustment Amount" shall mean (i) if no notice of
Disputed Items is delivered by Buyer within the period provided in Section
2.3(d), the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Statement of Final Adjustment
as prepared by Sellers or (ii) if such a notice of Disputed Items is
delivered by Buyer, either (x) the Adjustment Amount as agreed to in writing
by Sellers and Buyer or (y) the Adjustment Amount as shown in the Independent
Accountant\'s calculation delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3(e). The
parties acknowledge that they have discussed their past contacts, if any,
with the Independent Accountant, and that neither party shall have the right
to object to the Independent Accountant\'s service in such role by reason of
non-disclosure of past contacts, conflicts of interest, or any other reason.
The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountant shall
be limited to the unresolved Disputed Items, and the Independent Accountant
is not to make any other determination. Any determinations by the Independent
Accountant, and any work or analyses performed by the Independent Accountant,
in connection with its resolution of any dispute under this Section 2.3 shall
not be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding between the
parties, other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations
under this Section 2.3.   (e) If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than
the Estimated Adjusted Amount, then Sellers shall, within 10 Business Days
after the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written
instructions given to Sellers by Buyer, the amount of such shortfall,
together with interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of
such payment at a rate equal to the Prime Rate. If the Final Adjustment
Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then Buyer shall,
within 10 Business Days after the determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount, pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with written instructions given by Sellers to Buyer, the amount of
such excess, together with interest on such amount from the Closing Date to
the date of such payment at a rate equal to the Prime Rate.   ARTICLE

material respect or (ii) the failure of Sellers to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant to be complied with by them hereunder.
Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b), no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to their
respective obligations hereunder.   (b) Sellers shall have the right to
disclose additional matters (a "Supplemental Disclosure Item") in a letter to
Buyer (a "Supplemental Disclosure Letter") from time to time prior to the
Closing as necessary in order to make the representations and warranties true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date and
each such Supplemental Disclosure Letter shall be treated as having been
given on the date hereof and to prevent or cure any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty solely with respect to the indemnification provisions of
Section 8.2(a) below; no such disclosure shall limit, modify or affect in any
manner the conditions to Buyer\'s obligations in Section 6.2 below. The
delivery of a Supplemental Disclosure Letter with updated disclosures shall
not diminish Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1, including Section 9.1(b)(i).   (c) Buyer shall give prompt notice to
Sellers of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which it
has Knowledge that has caused any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect and (ii) the failure of a Buyer to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder. No such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties or
the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.   Section 4.4
Termination of Agreements. On or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause
the Target Entities to (a) terminate any loan agreements, advances or other
monetary obligations between (i) any Seller (or Affiliate of a Seller) and a
Target Entity or (ii) between the Target Entities; and (b) terminate any
rights or obligations of the Target Entities under the Tax Sharing Agreements
and the Shared Services Agreement.   Section 4.5 Real Estate Matters.  
(a) Title Insurance Commitments. As soon as commercially practicable after
the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall obtain and deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Buyer and CIP, a title insurance commitment with respect
to each of the Real Properties in form sufficient for the issuance of an ALTA
title insurance policy (each, a "Title Commitment") proposing to insure Buyer
and CIP with respect to fee simple title, or a valid leasehold interest, as
the case may be, to each Real Property, free and clear of Liens other than
the Permitted Liens, which Title Commitments shall be prepared by First
American Title Insurance Company, either directly or through a duly
authorized agent or affiliate (the "Title Company"), together with copies of
all instruments referred to therein, to the extent available or obtainable
from the applicable Governmental Authorities; provided, however, that Sellers
shall not be required to satisfy any conditions or requirements in connection
with the issuance of the Title Commitments arising solely in connection with
the transactions contemplated under the Asset Purchase Agreement.   (b)
Surveys. As soon as commercially practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Sellers shall obtain (with a duplicate original to Buyer and CIP)
a current new survey of each Real Property (each, a "Survey"), prepared by a
licensed surveyor in accordance with modified ALTA/ACSM standards which
are customarily required in order to allow the Title Company to issue each
Title Policy in accordance with this Agreement. Each Survey shall include a
metes and bounds legal description of the subject Real Property (and each
parcel thereof which has not been merged or consolidated in accordance with
Applicable Law) and be certified by the surveyors in favor of the appropriate
Seller, Buyer, CIP, and the Title Company. The Surveys shall otherwise be
reasonably satisfactory to Title Company and Buyer and shall show all
exceptions to the Title Commitments which are locatable.   (c) Title
Objections/Cure of Title Objections. With respect to each Real Property,
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving the later of, a Title
Commitment (including any downdate thereof or supplement thereto by
Title Company (each, a "Downdate")) or Survey, for such Real Property, Buyer
shall deliver to Sellers written notice (an "Objection Letter") specifying
any title defect or objection which Buyer, in its reasonable discretion,
shall have to matters contained in the subject Title Commitment and/or
Survey, other than Permitted Closing Date Liens ("Title Objections");
provided, however, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify
Seller of any Title Objection promptly upon discovering the basis for such
Title Objection, which shall in all events be no later than the time period
set forth hereinabove. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything to the
contrary set forth herein:   (i) Timing. If Buyer fails to notify Sellers of
a Title Objection  within the time provided herein, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have  accepted the Title Commitment, Survey and Real Property
subject to such  Title Objection, and such Title Objection shall be deemed a
Permitted  Closing Date Lien.   (ii) Cure. Within ten (10) Business Days
following Sellers\' receipt  of an Objection Letter, Sellers shall notify
Buyer in writing ("Seller\'s  Response"), whether, in its sole discretion,
Sellers elect to cure, remove  or release any or all of the Title Objections
set forth in the Objection  Letter, whereupon, if Sellers elect to cure,
remove or release, Sellers  shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
do so by the Closing Date  (or such longer period as may be reasonably
requested by Sellers). If  Sellers are unable or unwilling to effect a cure,
removal or release of  any Title Objection at or prior to Closing (or any
date to which Closing  has been adjourned), Buyer shall elect, in its sole
discretion, either to:  (A) accept the Real Property, with no adjustment or
abatement of the  Purchase Price; or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section  9.1(c)(i) below.   (iii) Title Downdate. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set  forth above, Buyer may not raise a new Title Objection
with respect to any  title defect or objection raised or appearing in any
Downdate if it was  raised or appeared in the original Title Commitment or
any previous  Downdate.   (iv) Permitted Liens. In no event shall Buyer be
entitled to raise  any Title Objection with respect to any Permitted Closing
Date Lien.   (v) Costs. Sellers and Buyer shall share equally in the cost
of  obtaining (i) the Title Commitments and Surveys; (ii) environmental 
reports and (iii) Title Policies.   Section 4.6 Contribution of Assets and
Properties; Excluded Assets. Buyer acknowledges that certain Assets
(including Target Entity Exclusive Intellectual Property) may be held by
Sellers or their Affiliates on the date of this Agreement and will, prior to
Closing, be transferred to the Target Entities or to a newly formed entity
which will be transferred to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, Seller will provide to Buyer executed written assignments
of any material Target Entity Exclusive Intellectual Property that is
transferred pursuant to this Section 4.6 so as to permit Buyer to properly
record, if required, any such assignments with the USPTO or U.S. Copyright
Office, as applicable. Therefore, so long as such Assets are transferred to
the Target Entities prior to Closing, the failure of the Target Entities or
such newly formed entity to hold such assets on the date of this Agreement
shall not constitute a breach or default hereunder. In addition, unless
otherwise to be assigned or conveyed to Buyer in accordance with Section 5.20
hereof, prior to Closing, Sellers shall cause the Target Entities to transfer
to Sellers or their Affiliates the Excluded Assets, and Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that the transfer of the Excluded Assets to Sellers or their
Affiliates shall not constitute a breach or default hereunder. The
Sellers shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities arising out of any
such transfer of Assets or Excluded Assets.   Section 4.7 Resignations. On
the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause to be delivered to Buyer duly signed
resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of all directors of
the Companies and such officers or managers of the Target Entities (other
than any such officers or managers that are Target Entity Employees) at
Buyer\'s request and shall take such other action as is necessary to
accomplish the foregoing.   Section 4.8 Termination of Affiliate Relations.
Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, on or
prior to the Closing Date, (i) all indebtedness of a Target Entity to Sellers
or their Affiliates or of Sellers or their Affiliates to a Target Entity
shall be cancelled, settled and terminated without any payment or other
transfer of assets or rights in respect of such indebtedness, except for
transfers of Assets as contemplated under Section 4.6 hereof and (ii) all
other Liabilities owed to SF Parent, Sellers or any of their Affiliates by
the Target Entities, as the case may be, or owed to the Target Entities by SF
Parent, Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall in each case be cancelled,
settled and terminated without any payment in respect of such Liability,
except for transfers of Assets as contemplated under Section 4.6 hereof.  
Section 4.9 Financial Statements. Sellers shall prepare and deliver, prior to
the Closing, an audited balance sheet and audited statements of operations
and cash flows of the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2005 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006.  
Section 4.10 Other Adjustments. On the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall
make appropriate adjustments, apportionments and prorations as of midnight on
the day immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to (i) ad valorem
taxes imposed with respect to the ownership of property and payable pursuant
to or as required by the Leases; (ii) water charges, sewer rents,
vault charges, if any, including taxes thereon; (iii) value of fuel stored on
the Real Property constituting part of the Assets (purchased and paid for by
Sellers prior to the Closing), including fuel taxes thereon; (iv) utilities,
including telephone, steam, electricity and gas, including utility taxes
thereon, on the basis of the most recently issued bills therefor, subject to
adjustment after the Closing when the next bills are available, or if current
meter readings are available, on the basis of such readings; and (v) except
as otherwise provided herein, such other items (including, without
limitation, real estate Taxes) as are customarily apportioned in connection
with the sale of similar properties and that have been accrued and unpaid or
have been prepaid as of the Closing Date under the Leases, Contracts and
Licenses that are being assumed by Buyer hereunder (the amounts described in
the preceding clauses (i) through (v) being referred to collectively as the
"Proration Items") shall be added to or deducted from the Purchase Price, as
the case may be, and, to the extent subtracted from the Purchase Price, shall
be paid when due by Buyer. If after the Closing Date any Proration Items that
were not accrued or reflected as prepaid as of the Closing Date, but are
otherwise attributable, in the case of unpaid items, to periods prior to the
Closing Date, in the case of prepaid items, to periods after the Closing
Date, or in the case of refunded amounts, to periods prior to the Closing
Date and, in each case, that are not otherwise provided for herein, then
Buyer shall send notice thereof to Sellers, or Sellers shall send
notice thereof to Buyer, as the case may be, describing such amounts in
reasonable detail and, in the case of unpaid items, Sellers shall remit
payment to Buyer of such amounts as are properly attributable to periods
prior to the Closing Date, in the case of prepaid items, Buyer shall remit
payment to Sellers of such amounts as are properly attributable to periods
after the Closing Date, and, in the case of refunded items, Buyer shall remit
payment to Sellers of such amounts as are properly attributable to periods
prior to the Closing Date, in each case, promptly following the receipt of
such notice or notices.   ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   Section 5.1
Tax Matters.   (a) Income Taxes. All income, deduction, gain, loss and
credit ("Tax Items") of the Target Entities for tax periods through and
including the Closing Date shall be included in the consolidated federal
income Tax Returns of SF Parent and, except with respect to state and local
income Tax Returns filed by a Company on a standalone basis, in the
applicable state and local income Tax Returns of Sellers or SF Parent and its
Affiliates. Sellers shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
on a basis consistent with past practice the state and local income Tax
Returns, if any, of each of the Companies for each jurisdiction in which each
such Company files income Tax Returns on a standalone basis for a taxable
year that ends on or before the Closing Date and shall cause each such
Company to close its taxable year on the Closing Date in any jurisdiction in
which such a choice or election is available. Sellers shall pay or cause to
be paid the income Taxes reported on each such standalone state or local Tax
Return. All Tax Items of the Target Entities for taxable years beginning
after the Closing Date shall be included in income Tax Returns of the Target
Entities, Buyer or its Affiliates, and Buyer shall prepare and file or cause
to be prepared and filed all income Tax Returns required to be filed for the
Target Entities or in which the Target Entities or their Tax Items
are included for all taxable years beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes reported on such Tax Returns. All Tax
Items of a Target Entity for a Straddle Period for which an election was not
available to close the taxable year on the Closing Date, shall be prepared by
such Target Entity consistently with the past practice of such Target Entity
and each such Tax Return shall be delivered to Sellers at least thirty (30)
days before the date on which each such Tax Return is required to be filed.
If Buyer and Sellers have not jointly approved any such Tax Return within
fifteen (15) days after its receipt by Sellers, any disputed items shall be
submitted for resolution to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the "Referee"), whose decision with regard
to the disputed items will be binding on Buyer, Sellers and the Target
Entity. The costs, fees and expenses of the Referee will be borne by the
party whose position is least similar to that of the Referee. The income
Taxes reported on each Straddle Period income Tax Return shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period in proportion
to the income that would be allocated to each such period in accordance with
Section 5.1(b) if each such period were a separate taxable year. Sellers
shall pay or cause to be paid and shall be responsible for any such Taxes so
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any Taxes resulting from
the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid and
shall be responsible for the portion of such income Taxes so allocated to the
Post-Closing Tax Period.   (b) Allocation of Target Entity Income. Unless
otherwise required by Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), the Tax
Items of each of the Companies shall be allocated for income Tax purposes
between the period up to and including the Closing Date and the period after
the Closing Date by closing the books of each Company at the end of the
Closing Date and no ratable allocation election shall be made pursuant to
Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D). Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers and SF Parent against any income Taxes, computed without
taking into account available net operating losses and at a 35% federal
income Tax rate and the highest applicable state income Tax rate, on income
resulting from any transaction engaged in by a Target Entity at the
discretion of the Buyer, CIP or an Affiliate of either of them.   (c) Code
Section 338(h)(10) Election. At Buyer\'s request, SF Parent shall join with
Buyer in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and, if required
by law or if Buyer so requests, under corresponding provisions of state or
local income Tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares
hereunder (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") and, in
such event, SF Parent shall include in its consolidated federal income Tax
Return for the taxable year in which the sale of Shares occurs the Tax Items
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election (and, to the extent
applicable, corresponding inclusions shall be made in the applicable state or
local income Tax Returns); provided that Sellers and Buyer will negotiate in
good faith with respect to the structuring, at Sellers\' expense, of the sale
of the Shares of Darien Lake to attempt to reduce the New York State Taxes,
if any, that would arise from the sale of Darien Lake. If one or more Section
338(h)(10) Elections are requested by Buyer, the Parties agree to cooperate
in the completion and timely filing of such Section 338(h)(10) Elections,
including allocating among the assets of each applicable Company the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to the applicable Shares, together with the
applicable liabilities (plus other relevant items), on an allocation schedule
with respect to such Shares which shall be prepared in accordance with
Section 338 and the Regulations thereunder (the "Section 338 Allocation
Schedule"). Subject to proper adjustment for capitalized acquisition costs
and selling expenses, Buyer shall and shall cause the Target Entities to, and
Sellers and SF Parent shall, file all federal income Tax Returns
and applicable state and local income Tax Returns consistently with the
Section 338 Allocation Schedule.   (d) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes.
Sellers shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns with respect to Taxes other than income Taxes ("Other Taxes") of the
Target Entities or with respect to the Assets or the Businesses that are
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, and Sellers shall pay or
cause to be paid all Other Taxes required to be reported on such Tax Returns
and all Other Taxes otherwise payable on or before the Closing Date. Buyer
shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns with
respect to Other Taxes of the Target Entities or with respect to the Assets
or the Businesses that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Other Taxes required to be reported
on such Tax Returns and all Other Taxes otherwise payable after the Closing
Date.   (e) Refunds, Credits and Offsets. Within five (5) Business
Days after receipt, crediting or offset thereof or entitlement thereto, Buyer
and the Target Entities shall pay to Sellers and jointly and severally shall
be responsible to Sellers for the amount of any refunds received by or
credited, offset or otherwise applied for the benefit of (including any
interest associated therewith) Buyer or a Target Entity or their Affiliates
after the Closing Date of Taxes reported on a Tax Return that Sellers were
required to file hereunder or that Sellers paid. Buyer and the Target
Entities shall, if Sellers so request, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and to expedite the receipt of any such refunds or the benefit of any
such credit or offset.   (f) Audits. After the Closing Date, each of
Sellers and Buyer shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of
notice of the commencement of a Tax audit or other administrative or judicial
investigation or proceeding relating to Taxes of a Target Entity or the
Assets or Businesses (a "Tax Audit"), for which, if determined adversely to
the taxpayer, the other party would be liable under this Agreement. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known by the
notifying party) describing the Tax Audit in detail and shall include copies
of all correspondence with Governmental Authorities and all other writings in
the possession of the notifying party relating to the Tax Audit. The party
responsible for the Taxes that are the subject of the Tax Audit shall have
the right (but not the obligation) to assume, at its own expense, the defense
of the Tax Audit and, in such case, the notifying party shall provide such
cooperation as is necessary to assist the other party in defending the Tax
Audit, including executing such extensions of the statute of limitations and
other documents as the party responsible for the Taxes requests the other
party to execute in connection with a Tax Audit; provided, however, that if
the party responsible for the Taxes does not assume the defense of any Tax
Audit, such party shall nevertheless be kept fully informed with respect to
the status of the Tax Audit and the Tax Audit shall not be settled without
such other party\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (g) Post-Closing Tax Actions. Sellers shall have no
liability to Buyer for, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
against, any Taxes resulting from or arising out of actions taken or
transactions engaged in by Buyer, a Target Entity, or any of their Affiliates
or representatives after the Closing (excluding actions or transactions that
are required by this Agreement, but not excluding actions or transactions
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement or arising from the leaseback of
assets related thereto even if required by this Agreement), including without
limitation, any election made by any of them after the Closing with respect
to Taxes of a Target Entity or with respect to the Assets or the Businesses
(other than the Section 338(h)(10) Elections). Neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates or representatives (including without limitation, a Target Entity)
shall file an amended Tax return or agree to an extension of a statute of
limitations with respect to a taxable period of a Target Entity beginning
before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall have no liability to
Sellers for, and Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer against, any
Taxes resulting from or arising out of actions taken or transactions engaged
in by Sellers or any of their Affiliates or representatives after the Closing
(excluding actions or transactions that are required by this Agreement),
including without limitation, any election made by any of them after the
Closing with respect to Taxes of a Target Entity or with respect to the
Assets or the Businesses. Neither Sellers nor their Affiliates
or representatives, nor a Target Entity shall file an amended Tax return or
agree to an extension of the statute of limitations with respect to a taxable
period of a Target Entity beginning after the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (h) Carryback of Tax Attributes. Unless Sellers otherwise agree
in writing, Buyer shall cause the Target Entities to elect under Section
172(b)(3) of the Code (and similar provisions of state, local and foreign Tax
law) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to any net
operating losses or other tax attributes arising in periods after the Closing
Date that could be carried back to a periods prior to the Closing Date.  
(i) Liability Limited to Out-of-Pocket Taxes. Sellers shall have no liability
to Buyer or otherwise under this Agreement with respect to Taxes unless, and
then only to the extent, Buyer or the Target Entities become liable after the
Closing Date for an out-of-pocket cash payment to a Governmental Authority
for Tax liabilities that Sellers were required to pay under
this Agreement.   (j) Nonforeign Affidavit. Each Seller shall furnish Buyer
with an affidavit stating, under penalty of perjury, such Seller\'s U.S.
taxpayer identification number and that such Seller is not a foreign person
(a "FIRPTA Certificate").   (k) Transfer Taxes and Other Expenses. All
sales, use, transfer and documentary Taxes and recording and filing fees
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), if any, applicable to the transactions
effectuated pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be borne
50% by Sellers, on the one hand, and 50% by Buyer, on the other hand;
provided, however, that Sellers shall not be liable for any Transfer Taxes or
any other Taxes relating to the sale and leaseback of assets under the Asset
Purchase Agreement, which shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities.   (l)
Tax Information and Cooperation. Sellers and Buyer shall provide each other
with such information and cooperation as either of them reasonably requests
from the other in connection with Tax Returns and Tax Audits,
including providing access to personnel of the other party and copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules and related work papers, and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Governmental Authorities. Each party will retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers and all other material records and
documents relating to Tax matters of the Target Entities until the expiration
of the statute of limitations for the taxable periods to which such Tax
Returns and related papers and documents relate. Any information obtained by
a party from the other related to Taxes shall be kept confidential, except as
may be necessary in conjunction with Tax Returns, Claims for refund or Tax
Audits. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall cause the
Target Entities and their Affiliates to make available and provide to Sellers
and their representatives, access to the facilities, personnel and properties
of the Target Entities and to all of their information, files, documents and
records, however stored, relating to the Target Entities or their businesses
or operations during periods on or prior to the Closing Date.   Section 5.2
WARN Act. For a period of 91 days (inclusive) following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall not cause or permit any Target Entity to implement any facility
closing, mass layoff or other termination of employees which, either alone or
in the aggregate (with each other and/or with any facility closing, mass
layoff or other termination of employees by any Target Entity on or prior to
the Closing Date), would create any obligations upon or Liabilities for any
Target Entity or any Seller under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or similar Applicable Laws.   Section 5.3 No
Other Representations or Warranties. (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
it has (or will prior to Closing have) made its own inquiry and investigation
into, and has formed an independent judgment concerning, the Target Entities
and the Business and Assets, and Buyer has been furnished with or given full
access to such information about the Target Entities and the Business and
Assets as was necessary therefor. In connection with its investigation of the
Target Entities and the Business and Assets, Buyer and its representatives
have received from Sellers or the Target Entities or their representatives
certain projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budget information, as
to which Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) there are meaningful
uncertainties; (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; and (iii)
Buyer takes full responsibility for making its own evaluations of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans
and budgets so furnished to it or its representatives.   (b) Buyer agrees
that, except for the representations and warranties made by Sellers that are
expressly set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, none of Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates or representatives has made, and none of them
shall be deemed to have made, to Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives
any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations
and warranties made by Sellers set forth in Section 3.1, Buyer agrees that no
Seller or any Affiliate or representative of a Seller makes or has made any
representation or warranty to Buyer or to any of its Affiliates
or representatives with respect to:   (i) any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets of  future revenue, expenses or expenditures,
results of operations (or any  component thereof), cash flows (or any
component thereof) or financial  condition (or any component thereof) of the
Target Entities or the future  business, operations, profitability or affairs
of the Target Entities  heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to Buyer or its  representatives or Affiliates; or   (ii) any
other information, statements or documents heretofore or  hereafter delivered
to or made available to Buyer or its representatives  or Affiliates, with
respect to the Target Entities or the business,  operations or affairs of the
Target Entities, except as expressly covered  by representations and
warranties made by Sellers and set forth in Section  3.1.   Section 5.4
Waiver. Buyer hereby waives, and agrees to cause the Target Entities to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with (a) counsel to the
Target Entities or any Seller representing Sellers following the Closing and
(b) the communication by such counsel to Sellers in connection with any such
representation, of any fact known to such counsel, including in connection
with a dispute with Buyer or any Target Entity on or following
the Closing.   Section 5.5 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Effective
immediately prior to the Closing, and contingent upon Closing, Sellers shall
cause each Target Entity to terminate such Target Entity\'s participation in
the Seller Plans. All wages, commissions, employee payroll deductions,
employer matching and profit sharing contributions, and employee withholding
taxes relating to the employment of current or former Target Entity Employees
through the Closing Date shall be paid by the Sellers on or prior to the
Closing Date, except in the case of contributions to tax-qualified plans,
which shall be made by Sellers in accordance with the terms of such plans.
All bonus and incentive compensation amounts payable under the Seller Plans
and Employee Benefit Plan (whether or not subject to continued employment
requirements) with respect to the 2006 calendar year shall be paid in full by
the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date. Except as provided in Section
5.5(b), Sellers shall retain sole liability for all benefits, premiums, costs
and expenses (including the costs of administration and termination thereof)
with respect to all Seller Plans. Buyer shall not assume and Sellers shall
retain responsibility for any COBRA obligation under Seller Plans to any
Target Entity Employee or former Target Entity Employee or his or her
eligible dependents who is terminated from employment or otherwise
experiences a qualifying event prior to the Closing Date and with respect to
Claims incurred prior to the Closing Date under Seller Plans that are
employee welfare benefit plans. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a
Claim is deemed incurred when the services that are subject to the claim
are performed; in the case of life insurance, when death occurs; in the case
of disability benefits, when the disability occurs; and in the case of a
hospital stay, when the employee or covered dependent first enters the
hospital. Buyer and the Target Entities shall not assume or be obligated to
pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Liabilities with respect to any
Pension Plan. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Target Entities
shall have no Liabilities or obligations whatsoever with respect to the
Seller Plans, and Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Target
Entities) shall have no Liabilities or obligations whatsoever with respect to
the Employee Benefit Plans from and after the Closing Date, other than to the
extent any such Liability is a Retained Liability.   (b) Buyer shall allow
all Target Entity Employees and their dependents to participate, effective as
of the Closing Date, in Buyer\'s benefit plans without any gap or lapse in
coverage. The Target Entity Employees and their eligible dependents shall not
be subject to any pre-existing condition limitations or actively at work or
proof of insurability requirements under Buyer\'s group health plans to the
extent that such limitations or requirements were not applicable to Target
Entity Employees under the group health or other welfare plans maintained for
the benefit of the Target Entities. Buyer\'s employee benefit plans and
programs shall recognize all service credited to any Target Entity Employee
for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual under
any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA) and (ii) the amount of annual
vacation time under any vacation policy to which a Target Entity Employee
shall be entitled; provided, however, that such service need not be credited
to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer shall pay
or reimburse Sellers, or shall cause the Target Entities to pay or reimburse
Sellers, for any severance or other payments due and payable or made (on
account of an amount due and payable) by Sellers under the
severance agreements listed in Section 5.5(b)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule or that otherwise become due and payable after the Closing to any
Target Entity Employee, including, without limitation, as a result of a
constructive termination.   (c) Subject to Applicable Law, Sellers and
Target Entities shall make available to Buyer such information as Buyer may
reasonably request relating to the Target Entity Employees for purposes of
administering Buyer\'s benefit plans. Prior to Closing, Sellers shall
cooperate and shall cause the Target Entities to cooperate with Buyer so as
to allow Buyer to conduct for Target Entity Employees prior to the Closing
Date an open enrollment period for enrollment under Buyer\'s benefit plans
and employee orientation sessions, with employee meetings to be held at times
reasonably agreed to by Buyer and Sellers.   (d) Nothing in this Agreement
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Target Entity Employee
in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other
matter.   Section 5.6 Books and Records. Buyer shall retain all of the
books and records of the Target Entities for a period of seven years after
the Closing or such longer time as may be required by Applicable Law and,
subject to restrictions imposed from time to time in good faith respecting
the provision of privileged communications or competitively sensitive
information and any applicable confidentiality agreement with any Person,
shall provide, only in such manner as does not unreasonably interfere with
the business of the Target Entities, reasonable access to such pre-Closing
books and records (or copies thereof) to Sellers or their agents, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, after the Closing to the extent
reasonably necessary for legitimate business reasons, such as disputing any
indemnification claim, the preparation of financial statements, the defense
of litigation or Tax Audits or compliance with other legal requirements.  
Section 5.7 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.(a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause

have the continuing obligation after the Closing to use commercially
reasonable efforts to endeavor to obtain all such Consents to the assignment
thereof (provided that neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to incur
any actual out-of-pocket costs payable to any third party, commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any third party) and, upon obtaining such Consents thereto, such Contract, if

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be transferred and
assigned to Buyer hereunder.   (c) With respect to any Contract that is not
included in the Assets to be transferred at the Closing by reason of Section
5.8(b) (a "Nonassigned Asset"), for a commercially reasonable period after
the Closing and until any Consent to such transfer is obtained and the
foregoing is sold and assigned to Buyer, the parties shall cooperate with
each other, upon written request, in endeavoring to obtain for Buyer, at no
cost to Sellers, an arrangement to provide for Buyer substantially comparable
benefits, and Buyer agrees to indemnify Sellers in respect of all Liabilities
of Sellers in respect of each such arrangement and underlying Contract. To
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in the event Consents to the
assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassigned Assets shall be held,
as of and from the Closing Date, by Sellers in trust for Buyer and the
covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Buyer or the
Target Entities in Sellers\' name and all benefits and obligations existing
thereunder shall be for Buyer\'s account. Sellers shall take or cause to be
taken at Buyer\'s expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may
reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the benefits of
the Nonassigned Assets and to effect collection of money or other
consideration that becomes due and payable under the Nonassigned Assets, and
Sellers shall promptly pay over to Buyer all money or other consideration
received by it in respect of all Nonassigned Assets. As of and from the

authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of
the Nonassigned Assets, at Buyer\'s expense, to perform all the obligations
and receive all the benefits of Sellers under the Nonassigned Assets and

respect thereto and Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities and Losses based upon, arising out of or
relating to Buyer\'s performance of, or failure to perform, such
obligations.   (d) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
the Contracts, agreements, leases, licenses or rights and that such consents
have not been and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that Sellers shall not
have any Liability whatsoever arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default
under or acceleration or termination of any Contract, agreement, lease,
license or right as a result thereof. Buyer further agrees that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such
consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination; or
(ii) any Claims or Liabilities commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any
such default, acceleration or termination.   Section 5.9 Insurance. As of
the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance policies related to the
Business shall continue in force only for the benefit of Sellers and their
Affiliates and not for the benefit of Buyer. Buyer agrees to arrange for its

any of Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' insurance policies which may provide
coverage for claims relating in any way to the Businesses prior to the

not cause or permit any of their Affiliates or any of the Target Entities to:

failure by Sellers or any Target Entity to perform groundwater  monitoring
required under, or any ongoing obligations with respect to  groundwater
monitoring pursuant to, that certain (A) Consent Agreement No.  92-08-31-01
dated as of August 31, 1992 by and among Colorado Department  of Health,
Elitch Gardens Company and Premier Parks Inc. (n/k/a Six Flags,  Inc.)(the

such Environmental Claims  shall be deemed Retained Liabilities.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations described in this subparagraph
(h) shall not be deemed to constitute "Sellers Remedial Obligations".   (i)
With respect to the Existing Darien Fireworks Condition:   (i) Sellers
shall, in consultation with Buyer and CIP and otherwise  in accordance with
the requirements of conducting Closure Activities  provided in subparagraph
(c) above, have Engineers perform testing (the  "Initial Perchlorate Test")
of the soil, sediment, surface water and  groundwater in the area of the
Owned Real Property impacted by the  "Fireworks of Concern" defined in
Sellers Remedial Obligations for this  Existing Condition and described in
the Environmental Assessment for this  Owned Real Property ("Property
Environment"), solely for the purpose of  establishing a baseline for
delineating then existing levels of  perchlorate, if any, in such Property
Environment (the "Baseline"). The  costs of such testing shall be paid 50% by
Sellers and 50% by Buyer and  CIP.   (ii) If, within three (3) years after
the Closing, the New York  State Department of Environmental Conservation
(NYSDEC) establishes a  delineation or standard of acceptable levels (or
functional equivalents)  of perchlorate levels in the Property Environment
(the "Perchlorate  Standard"), then Buyer shall, in reasonable good faith
consultation with  Sellers, select (other than Affiliates or consultants of
Buyer or CIP), a  qualified, properly licensed and insured environmental
engineering  consultant which is reasonably acceptable to, and has been pre-
approved  by, Sellers in their reasonable discretion (which approval shall
not be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to perform a test of
the  Property Environment comparable to the Initial Perchlorate Test to
measure  levels of perchlorate therein, if any (the "Second Perchlorate
Test"). If  the Second Perchlorate Test discloses levels of perchlorate in
the  Property Environment in excess of the Perchlorate Standard in violation
of  Environmental Law (the "Perchlorate Condition"), then:   (A) if the
levels of perchlorate disclosed in the Baseline  exceed the Perchlorate
Standard, the Perchlorate Condition shall be  deemed to be a Retained
Liability; and   (B) if the levels of perchlorate disclosed in the Baseline
do  not exceed the Perchlorate Standard, the Perchlorate Condition shall  be
deemed to be an Assumed Liability.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

shall continue until the Claim is fully resolved. Claims not asserted in
writing by the Buyer Survival Date shall be irrevocably and forever
abandoned.   Section 8.2 Indemnification by Sellers. From and after the
Closing Date, subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Article
VIII, Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and Buyer\'s officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
advisers, agents, Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Target
Entities), successors, heirs, permitted assigns and representatives (each, a
"Buyer Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties")
from and against, and will pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for, any and all Claims and Liabilities in connection with any investigation,
defense, prosecution or settlement of any matter as to which indemnification
is sought, whether or not involving or resulting from a third-party Claim
(collectively, "Losses"), incident to, arising from or in connection
with:   (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument
delivered by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; and   (b) any
breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of Sellers contained in this
Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument delivered by Sellers to
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; and   (c) the Retained Liabilities.  
Section 8.3 Limitation on Indemnification Obligations of Sellers.   (a)
Deductible. Sellers shall not be required to provide indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) unless, and only to the extent that, the cumulative amount
of all Losses suffered by any or all of the Buyer Indemnified Parties that
would otherwise be payable under Section 8.2(a) exceeds $5,000,000 (the
"Seller Deductible Amount") and the other provisions of this Article VIII are
satisfied; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
to any Losses arising out of the breach of a Fundamental Representation or a
Special Representation. For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) (but not for
determining the existence of any breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy with
respect to any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this
Agreement or any other agreement or instrument delivered to Buyers by Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement), any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.   (b) Cap. The aggregate liability of all Sellers for all
Losses of any kind arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort (including, without
limitation, strict liability or negligence), warranty or on other equitable
or legal grounds shall not exceed in the aggregate $50,000,000 (the "Seller
Cap"); provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
any Losses arising out of a Retained Liability, the breach of a Fundamental
Representation or a Special Representation or the breach of any agreement,
covenant or obligation of Sellers.   (c) Fraud Exception. The Seller Cap
shall not apply to Losses arising out of fraud actually committed.   (d)
Post-Closing Actions of Buyer, etc. Sellers shall have no liability to
indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for Losses to the extent that such Losses
result from or arise out of actions taken on or after the Closing Date by
Buyer, any Target Entity, or any of their respective Affiliates
or representatives (other than actions required by this Agreement) and such
Losses shall not be included in the determination of whether the Seller
Deductible Amount has been reached.   (e) Direct Losses Only.
Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Agreement, "Losses"
shall not include punitive, exemplary, consequential or incidental damages
and shall be limited to actual damages; provided, however, that it is
understood and agreed between the parties that third-party Losses actually
assessed against and paid by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties arising out of punitive, exemplary, consequential
or incidental damages shall be regarded as direct damages hereunder and shall
be included as "Losses" subject to indemnification by Sellers or Buyer,
as applicable, under this Article VIII. In the case of Taxes, Losses shall
include only out-of-pocket cash payments for Taxes.   (f) No Liability for
Recorded Amounts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 8.2 shall be
reduced by any amounts specifically reflected or specifically allowed for
such Loss in the Financial Statements.   (g) No Set-off. The parties agree
that neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have any
rights to set-off any Loss against any amount otherwise due to Sellers.  
(h) Known Liabilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
and except for any Losses arising out of a Retained Liability, as to which
the limitations of this Section 8.3(h) shall not apply, the parties
agree that (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
for (and the term "Losses" shall not be construed to include) any Liability
or other matter reasonably identified or disclosed to Buyer or its
representatives by Sellers or their representatives prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) the knowing waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty as of the time such representation was made, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will be
deemed, for all purposes hereunder, as a waiver by such party of the right to
indemnification, payment for Losses, and any and all other remedies based on
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.   Section 8.4
Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing Date, subject to the
limitations and other provisions of this Article VIII, Buyer agrees to
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and Sellers\' officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, advisers, agents, Affiliates, successors,
heirs, permitted assigns and representatives (each, a "Seller Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against,
and will pay or reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any and all
Losses incident to, arising from or in connection with:   (a) any breach of
any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any
other agreement or instrument delivered by Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement;   (b) any breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument
delivered by Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement; and   (c) the
Assumed Liabilities.   Section 8.5 Limitation on Indemnification Obligations
of Buyer.   (a) Deductible. Buyer shall not be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.4(a) unless, and shall be
required to provide indemnification only to the extent that, the cumulative
amount of all Losses suffered by any or all of the Seller Indemnified Parties
that would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 8.4(i) exceeds $5,000,000
(the "Buyer Deductible Amount") and the other provisions of this Article VIII
are satisfied; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply to any Losses arising out of the breach of a Buyer Fundamental
Representation. For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.5(a) (but not for determining
the existence of any breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect to
any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any
other agreement or instrument delivered to Buyers by Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement), any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
set forth in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.  
(b) Cap. The aggregate liability of Buyer for any Losses of any kind arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based
in contract, tort (including, without limitation, strict liability
or negligence), warranty or on other equitable or legal grounds shall not
exceed $50,000,000 (the "Buyer Cap"); provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any Losses arising out of an Assumed Liability,
the breach of a Buyer Fundamental Representation or the breach of any
agreement, covenant or obligation of Buyer.   (c) Fraud Exception. The
Buyer Cap shall not apply to Losses arising out of fraud actually
committed.   (d) Known Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, the parties agree that the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover for (and the term "Losses" shall not
be construed to include) any matter reasonably identified or disclosed to
Sellers or their representatives by Buyer or its representatives prior to the
Closing Date, except for any Losses arising out of an Assumed Liability or
the breach of a Fundamental Representation, as to which the limitations of
this Section 8.5(c) shall not apply.   (e) No Set-off. The parties agree
that no Seller nor any of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall have any
rights to set-off any Loss against any amount otherwise due to Buyer.  
Section 8.6 Taxes; Effect of Insurance; Mitigation.   (a) Taxes. The parties
agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for U.S. federal, state, and local income Tax purposes as an
adjustment of the Purchase Price. For purposes of computing the amount of
Losses incurred, paid or accrued by any party pursuant to Article VIII, the
parties agree that no Losses shall be deemed to have been sustained by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, to
the extent of any Tax benefits that are expected to become available to a
Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party with respect to such
Losses, computed at the highest marginal federal and state income Tax rates
then in effect and without regard to the actual Tax circumstances of the
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable.   (b)
Effect of Insurance. For purposes of computing the amount of Losses incurred,
paid or accrued by a party pursuant to this Article VIII, any insurance
proceeds or other reimbursements or benefits actually received by such party
relating to such Losses shall first be subtracted from such Losses.   (c)
Duty to Mitigate. Upon an Indemnified Party becoming aware of an event that
reasonably would be expected to give rise to a Loss, such Indemnified Party
shall take reasonable steps, consistent with normal policies or
sound commercial practices, to mitigate any such Loss.   Section 8.7
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) Notice of Claims - Non-Third-Party Claims.
A Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall, within the relevant limitation
period provided for in Article VIII, (i) in the case of indemnification
sought by any Seller Indemnified Party, give to Buyer, or (ii) in the case of
indemnification sought by any Buyer Indemnified Party, give to Sellers,
written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to the Claim for indemnification and shall include in such Claim
Notice (if then known or susceptible of estimation) the amount or the method
of computation of the amount of such Claim, and a reference to the provision
of this Agreement upon which such Claim is based.   (b) Claim Payment and
Disputes - Non-Third-Party Claims. The party obligated to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnitor") shall have thirty (30) Business Days after
its receipt of a Claim Notice to (i) agree to the amount or method of
determination set forth in the Claim Notice and pay such amount to such
Indemnified Party in immediately available funds or (ii) provide
such Indemnified Party with written notice that it disputes its obligation to
provide the indemnification sought in the Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice").
If the Indemnitor delivers a Dispute Notice, the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the matter. In the
event that the controversy is not resolved within 20 Business Days of the
giving of the Dispute Notice, the parties thereafter may pursue any and all
available remedies at law (subject to the limitations and conditions provided
in this Agreement).   (c) Third-Party Claims. If a Claim by a third party is
made against an Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party promptly shall
(i) in the case of indemnification sought by a Seller Indemnified Party,
notify Buyer or (ii) in the case of indemnification sought by a Buyer
Indemnified Party, notify Sellers, in writing of such Claims, setting forth a
description of such Claims in reasonable detail; provided, however, that
failure to give such written notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnitor has been
prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to undertake, conduct and assume control, through
counsel of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
and at its own expense, of the settlement or defense of such Claim, so long
as the Indemnitor notified the Indemnified Party of such defense in writing
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
third-party Claim and the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the third-party
Claim actively and diligently, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
fully in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such
Indemnified Party and paid at its own expense; and, provided, further,
that the Indemnified Party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel unless (x) the employment of such separate counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnitor, (y) the Indemnitor has
failed to assume the defense of such third party Claim within thirty (30)
days after receipt of notice thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party, or (z) the named parties to the proceeding in which
such Claim has been asserted include both the Indemnitor and such Indemnified
Party and, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party,
there exists one or more defenses that may be available to the Indemnified
Party that are in conflict with those available to the Indemnitor. The
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (d) Defense of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnitor has
received the Indemnified Party\'s written notice of a Claim of indemnity
hereunder and does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such notice that it elects to undertake the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake, at
Indemnitor\'s cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement
of the Claim, but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor
pursuant to this Agreement. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with
each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
such third-party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.7 to the
contrary, the Indemnitor shall not, except with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
enter into any settlement that (i) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such Claim of an
unconditional release from liability with respect to such Claim or (ii)
involves non-monetary relief or remedy that is binding upon the Indemnified
Party, including any restrictions on the Indemnified Party\'s ability to
operate or compete.   Section 8.8 Exclusive Remedy. Other than for fraud
actually committed, if the Closing occurs, the provisions of this Article
VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Losses caused as a result of
(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement or in any other certificate, document, writing or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (b) any breach or failure to perform
any covenant, agreement or obligation under this Agreement or in any other
certificate, document, writing or instrument required to be delivered under
this Agreement; or (c) any other cause of action alleging a Loss under or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; whether or
not related to Claims by third parties and regardless of whether such Claim
arises under contract, breach of warranty, tort or under any other legal or
equitable remedy.   Section 8.9 Single Recovery. The parties agree that if a
party is entitled to indemnification under more than one clause or subclause
of this Agreement, then such party shall be entitled to only one
indemnification or recovery with respect to the Losses arising out of the
same circumstances and events (it being understood that the purpose of this
sentence is solely to preclude a duplicate recovery by such party).  
Section 8.10 Assignment of Claims by Buyer Indemnified Party. A Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assign one or more of
its indemnification rights under this Article VIII (an "Assigned Claim") to
CIP upon written notice to Sellers, in which event CIP shall have the
indemnification rights and obligations under this Article VIII associated
with such Assigned Claim, and the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have no such
further rights with respect to such Assigned Claim or the matter or any of
the facts or circumstances underlying such Assigned Claim, it being agreed
that only one party shall have a right to seek indemnification under this
Article VIII with respect to an Assigned Claim or the matter or any of the
facts or circumstances underlying such Assigned Claim.   ARTICLE IX  
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated and the Acquisition may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing Date:   (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;  
(b) by either Buyer or Sellers:   (i) if there shall have been any breach by
the other party of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this  Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of
a condition  to the Closing hereunder and (B) either (1) cannot be cured or
(2) if it  can be cured, has not been cured prior to the first to occur of
(x) 5:00  p.m. on the date that is 20 days following receipt by the breaching
party  of written notice of such breach or (y) 5:00 p.m. on the date
immediately  preceding the Termination Date (the "Cure Period"); provided
that there  shall be no Cure Period for Buyer\'s failure to obtain the funds
necessary  to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in
accordance with the  terms and conditions hereof and thereof (which failure
shall constitute a  material breach of this Agreement).   (ii) if a court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental  Authority shall have issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other  action (which order, decree,
or ruling or action Buyer and Sellers shall  use their reasonable best
efforts to reverse), in each case permanently  restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and  such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and  nonappealable; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this  Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to any  party who did not comply with Section 5.7 or
otherwise use commercially  reasonable efforts to reverse any such order,
decree, ruling or other  action; or   (iii) if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before 5:00 p.m.  on April 10, 2007 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that the  right to terminate this Agreement under this
clause (iii) shall not be  available to any party whose breach of this
Agreement has been the cause  of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before such  date.   Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.(a)
In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Sellers or Buyer
as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of Buyer or
Sellers or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
stockholders, except that (i) the obligation to maintain the confidentiality
of information arising under Section 4.2 and the Confidentiality Agreement,
this Article IX and Sections 10.3 (Severability), 10.4 (Expenses and
Obligations), 10.5 (No Third-Party Rights), 10.6 (Assignment), 10.8
(Notices), 10.10 (Public Announcements), 10.12 (Affiliate Liability), 10.13
(Governing Law), and 10.14 (Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue) shall survive
such termination and (ii) no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability for a breach of any term or provision hereof.   (b) Sellers
hereby acknowledge that CIP is an intended third-party beneficiary of any
right of Buyer arising out of the breach of any term or provision of this
Agreement by Sellers prior to the Closing and shall be entitled to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement directly against the Sellers.   Section
9.3 Return of Information. Within five (5) Business Days following
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to, return to Sellers, or

Affiliates and representatives by or on behalf of Sellers, and all analyses,
compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other

(including electronic copies thereof) that refer to, relate to, discuss or
contain, or are based on, in whole or in part, any such Evaluation Material.
Buyer shall deliver a certificate signed by its Chief Executive Officer,
which certificate shall provide evidence reasonably substantiating the return
or destruction of the Evaluation Material as required under this Section
9.3.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 10.1 Further Assurances.
At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, upon the request of
Buyer, Sellers will execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be
executed, acknowledged or delivered, all such further documents, instruments
or assurances, as may be necessary, desirable or proper to carry out the
intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. Sellers and Buyer will
each, respectively, bear their or its own costs and expenses incurred in
compliance with this Section 10.1.   Section 10.2 Entire Agreement;
Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement, including all of the schedules,
annexes, exhibits and certificates attached hereto or delivered pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
parties. No amendment, supplement or modification of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by all parties. Other than as set forth in
Section 8.3(h) hereof, no waiver of any provisions of this Agreement will be
valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.   Section 10.3
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Applicable Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  
Section 10.4 Expenses and Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such costs or
expenses.   Section 10.5 No Third-Party Rights. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 8.2 hereof (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such persons) and Section 9.2(c).   Section 10.6 Assignment.
Except as set forth in Section 8.10, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing Date, Buyer may assign its
rights and interests under this Agreement, in all or part, to its Affiliates;
provided, that Buyer retains all liability hereunder as if no assignment had
been made and each Affiliate of Buyer that acquires or leases any of the
Assets of the Target Entities from CIP pursuant to the APA and
the transactions contemplated thereby shall agree in writing to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement (including Section 8.4 hereof) as if it were
Buyer hereunder.   Section 10.7 Specific Performance. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, and each party hereby agrees
in advance (A) to the granting of such specific performance of such
obligations without proof of actual damages or harm and (B) to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy. Each party agrees to pursue its right to seek specific performance
within sixty (60) days of the date of any breach by the other party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
provided that the conditions in Section 9.1(b)(i) have been satisfied.  
Section 10.8 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery if
delivered personally, or by telecopy or facsimile, upon confirmation
of receipt, (b) on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch
if delivered by a recognized next-day courier service, or (c) on the tenth

the other party.   Section 10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, including delivery by facsimile,
it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Section 10.10.....Public Announcements. Except as otherwise required by law
or by obligations pursuant to the rules of any securities exchange, for so
long as this Agreement is in effect, neither party shall make any public
disclosure regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   Section 10.11 Interpretation. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The meanings given to terms
defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural
forms of such terms. All parties will be considered drafters of this
Agreement and accordingly any ambiguity shall not be construed against any
particular party.   Section 10.12 Affiliate Liability. Each of the following
is herein referred to as a "Seller Affiliate": (a) any direct or indirect
holder of equity interests or securities in either Seller (whether limited or
general partners, members, stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director,
officer, employee, representative or agent of (i) either Seller or (ii) any
Person who controls either Seller. Except to the extent that a Seller
Affiliate is an express signatory thereto (in his, her or its individual
capacity and not merely as an authorized signatory for either Seller), no
Seller Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation to Buyer or any of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties of any nature whatsoever in connection with or
under this Agreement, any of the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties) hereby waives and releases all Claims of any such
liability and obligation, provided, however, that such waiver shall not apply
in the event of fraud actually committed.   Section 10.13 Governing Law.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the state of New York, without giving effect to any conflicts of law
provisions thereof.   Section 10.14 Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue. The
parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in New York
City, New York, and any appellate court to which an appeal from any such
state or Federal court may be taken, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agree that all Claims with respect to any such Claim may be
heard and determined in such state court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such Federal court. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such
Claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any New York state or Federal court located in New York City, New York and
the defense that such court is an inconvenient forum for the maintenance of
such Claim.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Buyer and Sellers have caused this
Agreement to be signed, all as of the date first written above.
