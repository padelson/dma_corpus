(1) each Assumed Option shall be exercisable (or shall become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for a number of shares of BBCN Common Stock equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of WIBC Common Stock that would be
issuable upon exercise of such WIBC Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole share; and

(2) the per share exercise price for the BBCN Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (x) the per share exercise price for such WIBC Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

 



14 Any restriction on the exercisability of such WIBC Stock Option in effect as
of the date hereof shall continue in full force and effect, and the term,
exercisability, and vesting schedule of such WIBC Stock Option as in effect on
the date hereof shall remain unchanged. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each
Person who holds an Assumed Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such WIBC Stock Option by the Surviving Corporation. WIBC and
BBCN shall cooperate and coordinate with respect to any materials to be
submitted to the holders of WIBC Stock Options in connection with any notice
required under this _Section 3.1(c)(i)_.

 

(ii) _Assumption of WIBC Stock Plans_. By virtue of the Merger, and without
any action by any holders of equity awards, BBCN shall assume the WIBC Stock
Plans (the " _Assumed Plan_ "), with such assumption to be effective as of the
Effective Time. Upon and following the Effective Time, BBCN shall be able to
grant stock awards, to the extent permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements
and applicable stock exchange listing regulations, under the terms of the
Assumed Plan, to issue the reserved but unissued shares of WIBC Common Stock
under the Assumed Plan and the shares that would otherwise return to the
Assumed Plan pursuant to the terms thereof, except that immediately upon the
Effective Time, all references to a number of shares of WIBC Common Stock
shall be (A) changed to references to BBCN Common Stock and (B) converted to
a number of shares of BBCN Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of WIBC Common Stock stated in the WIBC Stock Plans multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and all references to
WIBC in the Assumed Plan and Assumed Options shall be deemed to refer to
BBCN. The board of directors of BBCN (or an appropriate committee thereof in
accordance with Rule 16b-3(d) of the Exchange Act) shall, effective as of the
Effective Time, become the administrator of the Assumed Plan.

(iii) _WIBC Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each WIBC Restricted
Share then outstanding shall be assumed by BBCN. Subject to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the WIBC Stock Plans and any applicable award or
other agreement, each award of WIBC Restricted Shares then outstanding shall
be converted into the number of shares of BBCN Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of WIBC Common Stock subject to the WIBC Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share of BBCN Common Stock) (the "
_Assumed Restricted Shares_ "). Except as specifically provided in the
preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, each Assumed Restricted
Shares shall otherwise be subject to the same restrictions, terms
and conditions as were applicable to such shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time. WIBC and BBCN shall take all steps necessary to cause the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.1(c)(iii)_ to occur, including but
not limited to delivering all required notices. WIBC and BBCN shall cooperate
and coordinate with respect to any materials to be submitted to the holders of
WIBC Restricted Shares in connection with any notice required under this
_Section 3.1(c)(iii)_. 

(iv) The transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall in all
cases be done in a manner designed to comply with Section 409A of the Code
and, to the extent applicable, Section 424 of the Code.

 



15 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
any holder of WIBC Common Stock who is entitled to demand and has properly
exercised a demand for dissenters rights pursuant to Sections 1300 et. seq.
of the CGCL (the " _Dissenters  Rights Statute_") and who has not failed to
perfect, effectively withdrawn or lost such shareholders right to dissent
under the Dissenters Rights Statute (" _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), will
have, by virtue of the Merger, the right to receive and be paid the fair
market value (the " _Payment_ ") of the "dissenting shares" (as such term is
defined in the Dissenters Rights Statute) in accordance with the provisions
of the Dissenters Rights Statute, and no further rights other than
those provided under the Dissenters Rights Statute. After the amount of the
Payment has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the Dissenters
Rights Statute, any Dissenting Shareholder entitled to the Payment pursuant to
the Dissenters Rights Statute will be entitled to receive such Payment, and
the dissenting shares will thereupon be cancelled.

(e)  _BBCN Capital Stock_. Each share of BBCN Common Stock and each share of
BBCN Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding without change following the
Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation, except as provided in 
_Section 3.1(a)_.

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, BBCN shall deposit or make
available to a bank or trust company designated by BBCN and reasonably
acceptable to WIBC (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of WIBC Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , (i)
certificates or, at the option of BBCN, evidence of shares in book entry form
(collectively " _BBCN Certificates_ ") representing the shares of BBCN Common
Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in exchange for such shares of WIBC
Common Stock and (ii) sufficient cash to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of shares of WIBC
Common Stock of record immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares
were converted into shares of BBCN Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 3.1_
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that, with respect to WIBC
Certificates, delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the
WIBC Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the WIBC Certificates and
such letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as BBCN and WIBC may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
WIBC Certificates or WIBC Common Stock held in book entry form, as
applicable, in exchange for BBCN Certificates representing the number of whole
shares of BBCN Common Stock into which such WIBC Common Stock has been so
converted. Upon surrender of a WIBC Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal or submission of a
letter of transmittal in respect of shares of WIBC Common Stock in book entry
form, as applicable, duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably

 



16  require, the holder of such WIBC Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a BBCN Certificate representing that number of whole
shares of BBCN Common Stock, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the WIBC Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ (after taking into account all shares of WIBC Common Stock
then held by such holder), and the WIBC Common Stock so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of WIBC Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of WIBC, a BBCN
Certificate representing the proper number of shares of BBCN Common Stock may
be issued to a transferee if a duly executed letter of transmittal
accompanied, in the case of WIBC Common Stock in certificated form, by the
relevant WIBC Certificate representing such WIBC Common Stock, is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
WIBC Certificate and each book entry in respect of Common Stock in book entry
form shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the BBCN Common Stock into which such shares of WIBC Common Stock have been
converted as provided in this _Article II_ and the right to receive upon such
surrender cash in lieu of any fractional shares of BBCN Common Stock, if
applicable, as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to BBCN Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered WIBC Common Stock with respect to the shares of BBCN Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder of unsurrendered WIBC Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 3.2(e)_, until the holder of such WIBC Common Stock shall have
complied with the exchange procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_. Subject
to the effect of Applicable Legal Requirements, following the surrender of
any such WIBC Common Stock, there shall be paid to the holder of whole shares
of BBCN Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a
fractional share of BBCN Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, if applicable, and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with
respect to such whole shares of BBCN Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of BBCN
Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All shares of BBCN Common Stock issued upon
conversion of shares of WIBC Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(in each case, including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ or
_3.2(e)_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of WIBC Common Stock; subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by WIBC in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the

 



17  Surviving Corporation of the shares of WIBC Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any WIBC Certificate or letter of transmittal in respect of shares of
WIBC Common Stock in book entry form, as applicable, is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, the WIBC Common Stock represented
thereby or referred to therein shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of BBCN Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of WIBC Common Stock, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable WIBC Common
Stock by submission of a letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent
accompanied, in the case of WIBC Common Stock in certificated form, by the
applicable WIBC Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall pay each holder of
such WIBC Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of WIBC Common Stock held at the Effective Time
by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on
NASDAQ, as reported on the NASDAQ website at the close of NASDAQs regular
session of trading, for a share of BBCN Common Stock on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the stockholders of WIBC for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of WIBC Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for BBCN Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of BBCN Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
BBCN Common Stock.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of BBCN, WIBC or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of WIBC Common Stock for shares of BBCN Common
Stock, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(h) _Withholding_. BBCN shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of WIBC Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by BBCN, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of WIBC Common Stock, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by BBCN.

to BBCN as follows:

its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
so to qualify would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on WIBC. The copies of Articles
of Incorporation and By-laws of WIBC and Wilshire Bank, which have been
previously furnished to BBCN, are true, correct and complete copies of such
documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

(i) The authorized capital stock of WIBC consists of 200,000,000 shares of
common stock, without par value (the " _WIBC Common Stock_ "), and 5,000,000

(iii) Except for (A) this Agreement, (B) WIBC Stock Options, restricted
units and performance units issued under the WIBC Stock Plans, which

Stock Options) or to receive the value up to an aggregate of, respectively,
895,083, 135,874 and no shares of WIBC Common Stock, and (C) agreements
entered into and securities and other instruments issued after the date of
this Agreement to the extent permitted by _Section 5.1_, there are no
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character

deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or any Voting Debt or stock appreciation rights of WIBC or of
any Subsidiary of WIBC or obligating WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC to grant,

WIBC Common Stock, WIBC Preferred Stock or other securities under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), except any
such contractual obligations entered into after the date hereof to the extent
permitted by _Section 5.1_.

 

(iv) Since December 31, 2014, except as set forth in _Section 4.1(b)(iv)_ of
the WIBC Disclosure Schedule and except to the extent permitted by _Section
5.1_, WIBC has not (A) issued any shares of capital stock or securities

(B) repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly

securities of, or otherwise controls, any Person other than Wilshire Bank, in
the case of WIBC.

 



20 (vi) Set forth in _Section 4.1(b)(vi)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule is a
true, correct and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all
outstanding WIBC Stock Options and WIBC Restricted Shares and for each such

Restricted Share, whether WIBC has received a copy of an election made under
Section 83(b) of the Code, which, if applicable, was, to the knowledge of
WIBC, validly made and filed with the IRS in a timely fashion. No WIBC Stock
Option (whether or not currently outstanding) is, or has been, subject to
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(vii) With respect to the WIBC Stock Options, each such grant was made in
accordance with the terms of the WIBC Stock Plans and all Applicable Legal
Requirements, including valid exemptions from registration under the
Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws.

 

(c) _Organization and Qualification of the WIBC Trusts_. With respect to the
WIBC Trusts:

 

(i) Each WIBC Trust has issued and sold capital securities and common
securities under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (each a " _WIBC
Trust Agreement_ "), and WIBC has issued to each WIBC Trust, Floating Rate
Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (" _WIBC Debentures_ "),
under an Indenture (each Trusts Indenture and Trust Agreement are
collectively referred to as the " _WIBC Operative Documents_ "). _Section
4.1(c)(i)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with respect to each
WIBC Trust, the (i) date of its WIBC Trust Agreement and Indenture, (ii)
aggregate liquidation value of its capital securities, (ii) aggregate
liquidation value of its common securities, (iii) aggregate amount of WIBC
Debentures that have been issued to that WIBC Trust by WIBC, (iv) the rate
paid on its capital securities, the common securities and the WIBC Debentures,
(v) date after which WIBC may redeem the WIBC Debentures at par, and (vi)
maturity date of the WIBC Debentures.

 

(ii) Each WIBC Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Connecticut and
the State of Delaware, as applicable, with the power and authority to own
property and to conduct the business it transacts and proposes to transact and
to enter into and perform its obligations under the WIBC Operative Documents.
No WIBC Trust is a party to or otherwise bound by any material agreement other
than the WIBC Operative Documents and a Placement Agreement of even date with
the WIBC Trust Agreement. The WIBC Trust is and will, under current law,
be classified for federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as
an association taxable as a corporation.

 



21 (iii) The capital securities and the common securities issued by each WIBC
Trust have been duly authorized by the WIBC Trust Agreement, have been
validly issued and represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of
such WIBC Trust. None of the capital securities or the common securities is
subject to preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding common
securities issued by the WIBC Trusts are directly owned by WIBC free and clear
of any pledge, security interest, claim, lien or other encumbrance, and have
been issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
The common securities issued by the WIBC Trusts satisfy the eligibility
requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) issued under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Neither WIBC nor any of the WIBC Trusts is an "investment company"
or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," in each case within the
meaning of Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
without regard to Section 3(c) of that act. The WIBC Debentures are not held
of record by stockholders of WIBC or Wilshire Bank.

(iv) The sole assets of each WIBC Trust are its WIBC Debentures, any interest
paid on such WIBC Debentures to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such
WIBC Debentures, or any of the foregoing.

 

(v) All of the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities issued by the
WIBC Trusts have been invested in the WIBC Debentures. All of the proceeds
from the sale of the common securities issued by the WIBC Trusts have been
invested in the WIBC Debentures. All WIBC Debentures are and have been held by
the WIBC Trusts since their initial issuance.

 

(vi) Each WIBC Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and each WIBC Trust has not conducted any trade or business
since it was formed. Each WIBC Trust exists for the exclusive purposes of (i)
issuing and selling its capital securities and the common securities, (ii)
using the proceeds from the sale of its capital securities and the common
securities to acquire the WIBC Debentures, and (iii) engaging only in
activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. Each WIBC Trust was
formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of that WIBC Trust, and
the existence of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that purpose.
There is no intent to provide holders of such interests in either WIBC Trust
with diverse interests in the assets of that WIBC Trust.

 

(vii) Except as set forth on _Section 4.1(c)(vii)_ of the WIBC Disclosure
Schedule, WIBC has made timely payments of all installments of principal and
interest on, and performed all of its other obligations under, the WIBC
Debentures. Except as set forth on _Section 4.1(c)(vii)_ of the WIBC
Disclosure Schedule, WIBC has not exercised its right to defer interest
payments on any of the WIBC Debentures. Except as set forth on _Section
4.1(c)(vii)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule, WIBC has not been advised by the
Federal Reserve or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to defer
interest payments on any of the WIBC Debentures, nor does WIBC have knowledge
of any basis for the same.

 



22 (viii) Each WIBC Trusts income consists solely of payments made by WIBC with
respect to the WIBC Debentures, and such payments are not derived from the
active conduct of a financial business by that WIBC Trust. Both WIBCs
obligation to make those payments and the amounts thereof are set forth in the
WIBC Debentures. Neither WIBCs obligation to make those payments nor the
amounts payable by WIBC is dependent on income or profits of WIBC or any
Affiliate of WIBC (although WIBCs ability to do so is so dependent).

 

(ix) WIBC has not issued any class of capital shares either _pari passu_ or
senior to the WIBC Debentures. All WIBC Debentures are either _pari passu_ or
senior to WIBCs trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of
business.

 

(x) WIBC and each WIBC Trust have created a debtor-creditor relationship
between WIBC, as debtor, and that WIBC Trust, as a creditor, and WIBC and
each WIBC Trust have treated the WIBC Debentures as indebtedness for all tax
purposes.

(xi) Each WIBC Operative Document entered into by WIBC or any of its
Subsidiaries is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid, binding
and legally enforceable obligation of WIBC or one of its Subsidiaries, and to
the knowledge of WIBC, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equitable principles, including good faith,
commercial reasonableness, forthright negotiation and fair dealing).

 

(d) _Authority_.

 

(i) WIBC has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the requisite vote of the
holders of WIBC Stock, to consummate the transactions to which WIBC is a party
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by WIBC and
the consummation by WIBC of the transactions to which it is a party
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of WIBC, subject in the case of the consummation of the
Merger to the approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the
stockholders of WIBC. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
WIBC and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of WIBC, enforceable
against WIBC in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equitable principles.

 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not, (A) conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or

 



23  acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or
the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other encumbrance
on any assets (any such conflict, violation, default, right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a " _Violation_ ") pursuant
to, any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of WIBC or any
Significant Subsidiary of WIBC, or (B) except as set forth in _Section
4.1(d)(ii)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule and subject to obtaining or making
the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and filings referred to therein or in  _clause (iii)_ below, result in any
Violation of any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease,
WIBC Benefit Plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise or license, or any Applicable Legal Requirements
applicable to WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC or their respective properties or
assets, which Violation, in the case of _clause (B)_ above, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on WIBC or the Surviving Corporation.

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity (acting in any capacity)
is required by or with respect to WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by WIBC or the
consummation by WIBC of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Bank Merger), the failure to make or obtain which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on WIBC or the Surviving Corporation, except for (A) the filing
of appropriate applications and notices with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve_ ") under the BHC Act and the

modifications filed after the date of this Agreement with respect to reports
and documents filed before the date of this Agreement), each of such reports,

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall, at the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in
connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact

in full force and effect and WIBC and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with

is there any unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any regulatory
authority with respect to any report or statement relating to any

service provider of WIBC or any of its Subsidiaries, or any dependent or
beneficiary of any of the foregoing, has any present or future right to

(iv) Each WIBC Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and administered in
material compliance with, and complies in form with, Section 409A of the Code

for the indemnification, reimbursement or gross-up of any Taxes imposed by
Section 409A of the Code.

(v) With respect to each WIBC Benefit Plan, WIBC has complied and is now in
compliance, in all material respects, with all the provisions of ERISA, the
Code and all Applicable Legal Requirements, and each WIBC Benefit Plan has
been maintained and administered, in all material respects, in accordance with
its terms. Each WIBC Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or
advisory or opinion letter from the IRS affording equivalent reliance that it
is so qualified up to and including the current IRS remedial amendment cycle
applicable to such plan and no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of

affect the qualified status of any such WIBC Benefit Plan. No amendment is
required to be made to any such plan for which the remedial amendment period
is not open.

 



32 (vi) With respect to the WIBC Benefit Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of WIBC, there exists
no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which WIBC or any of

Schedule, (A) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement alone, or in combination with any other event, shall not give rise
to any liability under any WIBC Benefit Plan or WIBC Stock Plan, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any current or former stockholder, employee or
other service provider of WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC or
related beneficiaries, and (B) no amount that could be received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any WIBC Benefit Plan, WIBC Stock Plan or
other agreement, plan or arrangement currently in effect would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
WIBC Benefit Plan or WIBC Stock Plan provides for the gross-up, reimbursement
or indemnification of any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.

(ix) Except as set forth in _Section 4.1(l)(ix)_ of the WIBC Disclosure
Schedule, none of the assets of any WIBC Benefit Plan are invested in employer
securities or employer real property.

 

(x) With respect to each of the WIBC Benefit Plans, all contributions or
premium payments due and payable on or before the Closing Date have been
timely made, and, to the extent not presently payable, appropriate reserves
have been established for the payment and properly accrued in accordance with
customary accounting practices.

 

(xi) Since December 31, 2012, WIBC has complied in all material respects with

employees or independent contractor, consultant, intern, or other non-employee
service provider, except as described in _Section 4.1(l)(xi)_ of the WIBC
Disclosure Schedule. As of the date hereof and since December 31, 2012, to
the knowledge of WIBC, there are no organizational efforts with respect to the
formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened
involving employees of WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC. WIBC believes that the
relationships between Bank and its employees are good. To the knowledge of
WIBC, no senior executive officer or manager of any material operations of
WIBC or any group of employees of WIBC has or have any present plans to
terminate their employment with WIBC.

(m) _Bank Subsidiary_. WIBC owns all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Wilshire Bank, free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance. All

Secrecy Act or Know Your Customer Requirements, or in any manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies or its
management, nor has WIBC been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of
issuing or requesting) any such agreement, decree, memorandum of
understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter,
order, directive or similar submission, or any such policy, procedure or
board resolutions. WIBC and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all of the
foregoing so listed in _Section 4.1(n)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule.

(c) _Organization and Qualification of the BBCN Trusts_. With respect to the
BBCN Trusts:

 

(i) Each BBCN Trust has issued and sold capital securities and common
securities under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (each a " _BBCN
Trust Agreement_ "), and BBCN has issued to each BBCN Trust, Floating Rate
Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (" _BBCN Debentures_ "),
under an Indenture (each Trusts Indenture and Trust Agreement are
collectively referred to as the " _BBCN_

 



42   _Operative Documents_ "). _Section 4.2(c)(i)_ of the BBCN Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, with respect to each BBCN Trust, the (i) date of its BBCN
Trust Agreement and Indenture, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of its
capital securities, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of its common securities,
(iii) aggregate amount of BBCN Debentures that have been issued to that BBCN
Trust by BBCN, (iv) the rate paid on its capital securities, the common
securities and the BBCN Debentures, (v) date after which BBCN may redeem the
BBCN Debentures at par, and (vi) maturity date of the BBCN Debentures.

 

(ii) Each BBCN Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Connecticut and
the State of Delaware, as applicable, with the power and authority to own
property and to conduct the business it transacts and proposes to transact and
to enter into and perform its obligations under the BBCN Operative Documents.
No BBCN Trust is a party to or otherwise bound by any material agreement other
than the BBCN Operative Documents and a Placement Agreement of even date with
the BBCN Trust Agreement. The BBCN Trust is and will, under current law,
be classified for federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as
an association taxable as a corporation.

(iii) The capital securities and the common securities issued by each BBCN
Trust have been duly authorized by the BBCN Trust Agreement, have been validly
issued and represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of such BBCN
Trust. None of the capital securities or the common securities is subject to
preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding common securities
issued by the BBCN Trusts are directly owned by BBCN free and clear of any
pledge, security interest, claim, lien or other encumbrance, and have been
issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. The
common securities issued by the BBCN Trusts satisfy the eligibility
requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) issued under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Neither BBCN nor any of the BBCN Trusts is an "investment company" or
an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," in each case within the
meaning of Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
without regard to Section 3(c) of that act. The BBCN Debentures are not held
of record by stockholders of BBCN or BBCN Bank.

 

(iv) The sole assets of each BBCN Trust are its BBCN Debentures, any interest
paid on such BBCN Debentures to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such
BBCN Debentures, or any of the foregoing.

(v) All of the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities issued by the
BBCN Trusts have been invested in the BBCN Debentures. All of the proceeds
from the sale of the common securities issued by the BBCN Trusts have been
invested in the BBCN Debentures. All BBCN Debentures are and have been held
by the BBCN Trusts since their initial issuance.

(vi) Each BBCN Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and each BBCN Trust has not conducted any trade or business
since it was formed. Each BBCN Trust exists for the exclusive purposes of

 



43  (i) issuing and selling its capital securities and the common securities,
(ii) using the proceeds from the sale of its capital securities and the common
securities to acquire the BBCN Debentures, and (iii) engaging only in
activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. Each BBCN Trust was
formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of that BBCN Trust, and
the existence of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that purpose.
There is no intent to provide holders of such interests in either BBCN Trust
with diverse interests in the assets of that BBCN Trust.

 

(vii) Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(c)(vii)_ of the BBCN Disclosure
Schedule, BBCN has made timely payments of all installments of principal and
interest on, and performed all of its other obligations under, the BBCN
Debentures. Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(c)(vii)_ of the BBCN
Disclosure Schedule, BBCN has not exercised its right to defer interest
payments on any of the BBCN Debentures. Except as set forth on _Section
4.2(c)(vii)_ of the BBCN Disclosure Schedule, BBCN has not been advised by the
Federal Reserve or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to defer
interest payments on any of the BBCN Debentures, nor does BBCN have knowledge
of any basis for the same.

(viii) Each BBCN Trusts income consists solely of payments made by BBCN with
respect to the BBCN Debentures, and such payments are not derived from the
active conduct of a financial business by that BBCN Trust. Both BBCNs
obligation to make those payments and the amounts thereof are set forth in
the BBCN Debentures. Neither BBCNs obligation to make those payments nor the
amounts payable by BBCN is dependent on income or profits of BBCN or any
Affiliate of BBCN (although BBCNs ability to do so is so dependent).

(ix) BBCN has not issued any class of capital shares either _pari passu_ or

aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of BBCN, there exists

U.S.C. § 9601(35), or foreclose on or take a deed or title to any real estate

realized by the Parties as a result of the Merger, each of WIBC and BBCN
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consult with the other on all
strategic and 

 



68  operational matters to the extent such consultation is not in violation of
Applicable Legal Requirements, including laws regarding the exchange of
information and other laws regarding competition. Without in any way limiting
the provisions of _Section 6.2_, WIBC and BBCN, their respective Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives shall, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and in
a manner least disruptive to the other Party, be entitled to review the
operations and visit the facilities of the other Party and its Subsidiaries at
all times as may be deemed reasonably necessary by BBCN or WIBC, as the case
may be, in order to accomplish the foregoing arrangements.

5.4 _Advice of Changes; Government Filings_.

 

(a) Each Party shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with the other,
report on operational matters and promptly advise the other orally and in
writing of any change or event having, or which would, either individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
such Party or which would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of such Party contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not
constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in _Article
VI_ or give rise to any right of termination under _Article VII_ unless the
underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise
to such a right.

 

(b) WIBC and BBCN shall file all reports, schedules, applications,
registrations and other information required to be filed by each of them with
the SEC between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall,
if requested, deliver to the other Party copies of all such reports promptly

required to be filed with the applicable Governmental Entities between the
date hereof and the Effective Time and shall, if requested, make available to
the other Party copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed.
Each of WIBC and BBCN shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case subject to
Applicable Legal Requirements relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all the information relating to the other Party, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Parties agrees to act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that to the extent practicable it
shall consult with the other Party with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each Party shall keep the other Party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5.5 _Insurance_. During the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the Effective Time, each of BBCN and WIBC shall, and shall
cause their respective

 



69  Subsidiaries to, (a) use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
and keep in full force and effect all of their respective policies of
insurance presently in effect, or replacements for such policies, including
insurance of customer deposit accounts with the FDIC, and (b) take all
requisite action (including the making of claims and the giving of notices)
pursuant to their respective policies of insurance in order to preserve all
rights thereunder with respect to all matters which could reasonably give rise
to a claim prior to the Effective Time.

 

5.6 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement (including _Section 5.3_) shall give BBCN, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of WIBC or shall give WIBC,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of BBCN
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of WIBC and
BBCN shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, BBCN and
WIBC shall cooperate in preparing mutually acceptable proxy materials which
shall constitute the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the matters
to be submitted to the WIBC stockholders at the WIBC Stockholders Meeting and
to the BBCN stockholders at the BBCN Stockholders Meeting (such joint
proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and WIBC and BBCN shall prepare and
BBCN shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to WIBC with respect to the issuance of BBCN Common
Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Form S-4_"). Each of BBCN and WIBC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to file the initial, preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with
the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 45
days) following the date hereof. Each of BBCN and WIBC shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the
SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as is
reasonably practicable following the initial filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby. BBCN and WIBC shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of any
written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the SEC.
Each Party shall cooperate and provide the other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC,
and each Party shall provide the other Party with a copy of all such filings
made with the SEC. BBCN shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the Merger and each Party

 



70  shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital
stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. BBCN
shall advise WIBC, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the BBCN Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to either of the Parties, or their respective affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by either Party which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or
regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of WIBC and BBCN.

 

(b) WIBC shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _WIBC Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Required WIBC Vote. The WIBC Board shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from the WIBC stockholders the Required WIBC Vote;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to
limit the right of the WIBC Board to make a Change in Recommendation in
compliance with _Section 6.1(g)_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with _Section 8.1_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to relieve WIBC of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
stockholders for a vote on the approval of the principal terms of the Merger.
Subject to _Section 6.1(g)_, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include the recommendation of the WIBC Board that the stockholders of WIBC
vote to approve the principal terms of the Merger (such recommendation being
referred to herein as the " _WIBC Board Recommendation_ ").

(c) BBCN shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _BBCN Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Required BBCN Vote. The BBCN Board shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from the BBCN stockholders the Required BBCN Vote;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to
limit the right of the BBCN Board to make a Change in Recommendation in
compliance with _Section 6.1(g)_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with  _Section 8.1_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to relieve BBCN of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
stockholders for a vote on the adoption thereof. Subject to _Section 6.1(g)_,
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation of the
BBCN Board that the stockholders of BBCN vote to approve and adopt this
Agreement (such recommendation being referred to herein as the " _BBCN Board
Recommendation_ " and, together with the WIBC Board Recommendation, the "
_Board Recommendations_ ").

 



71 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Party may and, upon the written request of the other Party, shall, adjourn or
postpone such Partys Stockholders Meeting (i) if as of the time for which
such Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (i) there are insufficient
shares of such Partys Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) there are insufficient votes of holders to such
Partys Common Stock necessary to approve the principal terms of the Merger
by the Required WIBC Vote (in the case of WIBC) or to approve the Adoption,
the BBCN Charter Amendment and the Share Issuance by the Required BBCN Vote
(in the case of BBCN); _provided_  that nothing herein shall prevent a Party
from adjourning its Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Board of Directors of such Party has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
such Partys stockholders prior to such Partys Stockholders Meeting. 

(e) WIBC and BBCN shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the WIBC Stockholders Meeting and the BBCN Stockholders Meeting to be
held on the same date.

(f) Subject to _Section 6.1(g)_, neither the WIBC Board or the BBCN Board nor
any committee of either thereof shall: (i) withdraw, modify or qualify its
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the other Party, or adopt a
resolution to withdraw, modify or qualify its Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to the other Party or take any other action that is or becomes
disclosed publicly and which can reasonably be interpreted as indicating that
such board of directors or any committee thereof does not support the Merger
and this Agreement or does not believe that the Merger and this Agreement are
in the best interests of its stockholders; (ii) fail to reaffirm, without
qualification, its Board Recommendation or fail to state publicly, without
qualification, that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests
of its stockholders within five business days after the other Party requests
in writing that such action be taken; (iii) fail to announce publicly within
ten business days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the WIBC
Common Stock (in the case of the WIBC Board) or the BBCN Common Stock (in the
case of the BBCN Board), shall have been commenced, that it recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (iv) fail to issue within 10
business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced with
respect to WIBC (in the case of the WIBC Board) or BBCN (in the case of the
BBCN Board) a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition
Proposal; (v) approve, endorse or recommend any such Acquisition Proposal
with respect to WIBC (in the case of the WIBC Board) or BBCN (in the case of
the BBCN Board); or (vi) resolve to take any action described in _clauses (i)_
through _(v)_ of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in
_clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ of this sentence being referred to herein as a
" _Change in Recommendation_ ").

 



72 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Sections 6.1(b)_ ,
_6.1(c)_  or 6.1(f), at any time prior to the approval of the principal terms
of the Merger by the Required WIBC Vote (in the case of WIBC) or at any time
prior to the approval of the Adoption, the BBCN Charter Amendment and the
Share Issuance by the Required BBCN Vote (in the case of BBCN), the WIBC
Board or the BBCN Board, as the case may be, may effect a Change in
Recommendation:

 

(i) if: (A) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer to effect a transaction of the type referred to in the
definition of the term Superior Proposal is made to WIBC or BBCN (such Party
under such circumstances being referred to herein as a " _Target Party_ ") and
is not withdrawn; (B) such unsolicited, bona fide, written offer was not
obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a breach of, or any action
inconsistent with, this Agreement; (C) the Target Party has complied with its
obligations to provide notices to the other Party of any Acquisition Proposal
and other matters requiring notice under _Section 6.4(a)_; (D) at least five
business days prior to each meeting of the board of directors of a Target
Party at which such board of directors shall consider and determine whether
any such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Target Party provides the
other Party with a written notice specifying the date and time of such
meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of
the offer that is the basis of the potential action by the board of directors
of the Target Party (including a copy of any draft definitive agreement
reflecting the offer) and the identity of the Person making the offer (it
being agreed that any change to the terms and conditions of such offer shall
require a new notice and new five business day period); (E) the Target Party
board of directors determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into
account the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and its outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (F) the Target Party board of directors does not effect, or cause
the Target Party to effect, a Change in Recommendation at any time within
five business days after the other Party receives written notice from the
Target Party confirming that such board of directors has determined that such
offer is a Superior Proposal and intends to effect a Change in
Recommendation; (G) during such five business day period, if requested by
such other Party, the Target Party engages in good faith negotiations with
such other Party to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that
was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal; (H) at the end of such five business day period, such offer
has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other
Party as a result of the negotiations required by _clause (G)_ or otherwise);
and (I) the board of directors of the Target Party reasonably determines in
good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of its outside
legal counsel that, in light of such Superior Proposal, a Change in
Recommendation is required in order for such board of directors to comply with
its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under the Applicable
Legal Requirements; or

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances occurs (that is
not related to an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal)
or arises after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to WIBC or
BBCN or any of their respective executive officers, directors, advisors and
representatives nor reasonably foreseeable by WIBC or BBCN or any of their
respective executive officers, directors, advisors and representatives as of
the date of this Agreement (such material development or change in such
circumstances being referred to herein as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (B) at
least five (5) business days prior to each meeting of the WIBC Board or

 



73  the BBCN Board at which such board of directors intends to consider whether
such Intervening Event requires such board of directors to effect or cause
WIBC (in the case of the WIBC Board) or BBCN (in the case of the BBCN Board)
to effect, a Change in Recommendation, the Party whose board of directors is
to meet for such purpose provides the other Party with a written notice
specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons for holding such
meeting, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the Intervening Event
(it being agreed that any material change in such Intervening Event shall
require a new notice and five business day period); (C) during such
five business day period, if requested by the Party so notified, the Party
whose board of directors is to meet for such purpose engages in good faith
negotiations with the Party so notified to amend this Agreement in a manner
that obviates the need to effect or cause a Change in Recommendation as a
result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the board of directors that is
considering whether to effect a Change in Recommendation reasonably determines
in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a Change in
Recommendation is required in order for such board of directors to comply with
its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, WIBC and BBCN shall each (and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the representatives of the other,
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, in a manner least disruptive to all its properties, books, contracts and
records and, during such period, each of WIBC and BBCN shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws, federal or state banking laws or the rules
and regulations of self-regulatory organizations (other than reports or
documents which such Party is not permitted to disclose under Applicable Legal
Requirements) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request. Neither
Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) The Parties shall hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the letter, effective as of October 8, 2015, between WIBC and BBCN (as
amended by Amendment No. 1, dated November 4, 2015, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

(c) No such investigation by either BBCN or WIBC shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other. 

 



74 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of WIBC and BBCN shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to comply promptly with all Applicable Legal Requirements
which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
Merger and to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, and
(ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and/or any other public or private third party which is required to be
obtained or made by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Applicable Legal Requirements or any contract or other obligation in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party shall not be obligated to
take any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or such
compliance or the obtaining of such consent, authorization, order, approval
or exemption shall result in a condition or restriction on such Party or on
the Surviving Corporation having an effect of the type referred to in _Section
7.1(f)_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the Parties obligations
under this _Section 6.3_, each of the Parties further agrees as follows:

(i) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, each of WIBC and BBCN
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare all necessary documentation and effect all necessary
filings in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(ii) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall each furnish the
other and the others counsel with all information concerning themselves,
their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with any application,
petition or any other statement or application made by or on behalf of any
Party or its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and Bank Merger. WIBC and BBCN shall have the right to review in
advance all filings made in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with any Governmental Entity. In addition, WIBC and BBCN shall
each furnish to the other a final copy of each such filing made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Entity.

 

(iii) Subject to Applicable Legal Requirements, WIBC and BBCN shall permit
each other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or material oral
communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) between it and any
Governmental Entity.

 

(iv) WIBC and BBCN shall promptly inform each other of and supply to each
other any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received by
them from, or given by them to, any Governmental Entity, in each case,
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(v) WIBC and BBCN shall ensure that representatives of WIBC and BBCN shall
have the right to attend and participate in any hearing, proceeding, meeting,
conference or similar event before or with any Governmental Entity or other
organization relating to any Requisite Regulatory Approval or otherwise
relating to any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may
otherwise be required by such Governmental Entity (and in such event, only
after WIBC or BBCN, as the case may be, has advised such Governmental Entity
of its insistence that the other Party be permitted to attend). In furtherance
of the foregoing, WIBC and BBCN shall provide each other reasonable advance
notice of any such hearing, proceeding, meeting, conference or similar event.

 



75 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude either Party from
meeting with its regulators on its own volition to discuss confidential
supervisory information.

 

(c) BBCN agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered
by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective
Time, supplemental indentures and other instruments required for the due
assumption of WIBCs outstanding debt, guarantees and other securities to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees and securities and
the instruments and agreements relating thereto.

(d) Each of WIBC and BBCN and their respective boards of directors shall, if
any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Each of BBCN and WIBC agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries with respect to, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a transaction to
effect, (A) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving it or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the
stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of
equity securities or any amount of securities representing 20% or more of the
total voting power of it (or of the surviving parent entity in such
transaction) or of any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any purchase or sale or
other acquisition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock
of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, or other acquisition
of, its voting securities that, if

 



76  consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person)
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities or any
amount of securities representing 20% or more of the total voting power of it
(or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or of any of its
Subsidiaries, or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of it (any such
proposal, offer or transaction in any of the preceding clauses (A), (B), (C)
or (D) (other than a proposal or offer made by the other Party or an affiliate
thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii)
engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person relating
to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or encourage or knowingly facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to
make an Acquisition Proposal or any other proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of each Party
shall be permitted, at any time prior to the approval of the principal terms
of the Merger by the Required WIBC Vote (in the case of WIBC) or at any time
prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Required BBCN Vote
(in the case of BBCN), and subject to compliance by such Party with the other
terms of this _Section 6.4_ and to such Party first entering into a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to the other
Party) with the Person making the Acquisition Proposal described below having
provisions (including standstill provisions) that are no less favorable to
such Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (but
excluding the exclusivity provisions set forth in Amendment No. 1 to the
Confidentiality Agreement) and that expressly permits the Party to comply with
its obligations under this _Section 6.4_, to engage in discussions and
negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any
Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by
such Person made or renewed after the date of this Agreement which such
Partys board of directors (x) concludes in good faith constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) determines that
engaging in such discussions and negotiations with, or providing such
nonpublic information or data to, such Person is necessary in order for such
board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to its stockholders
under the Applicable Legal Requirements.

(ii) Each Party shall notify the other Party promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from
any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such Party
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or any other indication that
any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to it.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request
and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers
(including a copy thereof if in writing and any related

 



77  documentation or correspondence). Each Party shall also promptly, and in any
event within 24 hours, notify the other Party, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal
or provides nonpublic information or data to any Person in accordance with
this _Section 6.4(b)_ (and shall promptly provide to the other Party copies
of all material nonpublic information so provided not previously provided to
the other Party) and shall keep the other Party promptly and fully informed of
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing within 24 hours
of receipt a copy of all material documentation (including all draft
agreements) or correspondence relating thereto (including copies of all
changes in any terms). At least five (5) business days prior to each meeting
of the board of directors of any Party at which such board of directors shall
consider and determine whether any offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, such
Party shall provide the other Party with a written notice specifying the date
and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and
conditions of the offer that is the basis of the potential action by the board
of directors of such Party (including a copy of any draft definitive agreement
reflecting the offer) and the identity of the Person making the offer.

(c) Each of BBCN and WIBC agrees that (i) it shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents, representatives
and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and shall
promptly request each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with such Party in connection with the consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal or any other such proposal, to return or destroy
all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to such Person, (ii)
it shall enforce (and not release any third party from or waive) any
provisions of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or any other such proposal and (iii) it shall not take any action to
render inapplicable or to exempt any Person from Section 203 of the DGCL or
any other antitakeover legislation. Each of BBCN and WIBC agrees that it shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to inform its and its Subsidiaries
respective directors, executive officers, key employees, agents and
representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.4_.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall (i) permit either Party to terminate
this Agreement or (ii) affect any other obligation of the Parties under this
Agreement. Neither Party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall prohibit either Party or
its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way
limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has
under any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section 8.1(d)_ or
8.1(e), as applicable and, provided further, that any such disclosure shall be
subject to _Section 6.11_.

 



78 (f) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) made pursuant to _Section 6.4(e)_ shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation by WIBC or BBCN, as the case may be, unless the board of
directors of the Party making such disclosure expressly reaffirms its Board
Recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the approval of the principal
terms of the Merger or the adoption of this Agreement, as applicable.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed, as between the
Parties, to apply to each Party, its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries directors and employees, agents and representatives to the same
extent as such provisions apply to the respective Parties, and each Party
shall be responsible for any breach of such provisions by any of its or
its Subsidiaries directors, employees, agents or representatives.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. BBCN shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
the shares of BBCN Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_.

 

(a) BBCN and WIBC agree that, except as otherwise provided herein (including
as set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_ of the WIBC Disclosure Schedule or _Section
6.6(a)_ of the BBCN Disclosure Schedule, as applicable) and unless otherwise
mutually determined, the BBCN Benefit Plans and WIBC Benefit Plans in effect
at the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective Time
with respect to employees covered by such plans at the Effective Time, and the
Surviving Corporation shall as promptly as practical formulate Benefit Plans
for the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with respect both
to employees who were covered by the BBCN Benefit Plans and WIBC Benefit
Plans at the Effective Time and employees who were not covered by such plans
at the Effective Time, that provide benefits for services on a basis that does
not discriminate between employees who were covered by the BBCN Benefit Plans
and employees who were covered by the WIBC Benefit Plans. WIBC shall adopt
such amendments to the WIBC Benefit Plans as requested by BBCN to implement
the foregoing and to avoid the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if requested by BBCN, WIBC shall terminate
any plans, policies, programs or arrangements providing severance benefits,
such termination to be effective prior to the Effective Date.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, WIBC and BBCN
agree to adopt a severance and retention plan in amounts and with other terms
and conditions that are mutually acceptable to the Parties.

(c) WIBC and BBCN further agree that, to the extent that employees of WIBC
and its Subsidiaries or BBCN and its Subsidiaries are covered by Benefit Plans
of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) provide
employees of WIBC and its Subsidiaries and employees of BBCN and its
Subsidiaries credit for all years of service with WIBC or any of its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors, or BBCN and any of its Subsidiaries and
their predecessors, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time for the purpose
of eligibility and vesting, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations (to the extent such limitations did

 



79  not apply to a pre-existing condition under comparable Benefit Plans
applicable to the individual immediately prior to the Closing Date) and
eligibility waiting periods under group health plans of the Surviving
Corporation to be waived with respect to employees of WIBC and its
Subsidiaries and BBCN and its Subsidiaries who remain as employees of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents)
and (iii) cause to be credited, for purposes of the Surviving Corporations
health plans, any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees
of WIBC and its Subsidiaries and BBCN and its Subsidiaries and their
beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to
their participation in the Surviving Corporations health plans with the
objective that there be no double counting during the year in which the
Closing Date occurs of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that the Surviving
Corporation reasonably determines that legal, administrative, or other
impediments make compliance with the preceding sentence not
reasonably practicable or that such compliance would result in the
duplication of benefits, the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligations
or liabilities with respect to the requirements of the preceding sentence.
WIBC and BBCN hereby further agree that, except as otherwise specified in
this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored,
in accordance with their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to,
and contractual rights of, current and former employees of WIBC and its
Subsidiaries and BBCN and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, BBCN shall recognize and honor all unused sick leave and unused
vacation accrued by the employees of WIBC and its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time notwithstanding any limitations on sick leave accruals or
carry-overs or vacation accruals applicable under BBCNs sick leave or
vacation accrual policies.

 

(d) This _Section 6.6_ shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights,
nor shall it be enforceable by any employee, any person representing the
interest of employees, or any spouse, dependent, or beneficiary of any
employee, nor shall anything herein be or be deemed an amendment to any
employee benefit plan. This _Section 6.6_ is solely an agreement between
and for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and shall be enforceable
by them. No term of this Agreement shall be deemed to create any contract with
any employee or to give any employee the right to be retained in the
employment of the Surviving Corporation, or to interfere with the WIBCs,
BBCNs or the Surviving Corporations right to terminate the employment of any
employee at any time.

 

6.7 _WIBC Stock Option and WIBC Restricted Shares_.

 

(a) WIBC shall deliver to BBCN the Section 16 Information reasonably in
advance of the Effective Time, and the BBCN Board, or a committee of Non-
Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in
any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the
receipt by the WIBC Insiders of BBCN Common Stock in exchange for shares of
WIBC Common Stock (including WIBC Restricted Shares), and of options to
purchase BBCN Common Stock upon conversion of WIBC Stock Options, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such
securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by WIBC to BBCN
prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant
to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be
so exempt.

(b) BBCN agrees to file with the SEC, on the Closing Date (or by no later than
30 days after the Closing Date if permitted by Applicable Legal
Requirements), a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
relating to the BBCN Common Stock issuable with respect to the Assumed Options
and the Assumed Restricted Shares and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
thereafter for so long as any of Assumed Option or Assumed Restricted Shares
remain outstanding.

 



80 6.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense, except
as otherwise provided in _Section 8.2_ hereof and except that (a) if the
Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause to be
paid, any and all property or transfer Taxes imposed on either Party in
connection with the Merger, and (b) the filing fees and printing and mailing
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by BBCN
and WIBC.

 

6.9 _Governance; Name Change; Consolidation Committee._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, BBCN shall take all actions necessary to
adopt the amendment to the By-laws of BBCN provided for in  _Exhibit A_ and
to effect the requirements and adopt the resolutions referenced therein. On or
prior to the Effective Time, BBCN shall cause the number of directors that
shall comprise the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at
the Effective Time to be sixteen (16). Of the members of the initial board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, nine (9) shall
be current members of the BBCN Board as designated by BBCN prior to the
Effective Time, and seven (7) shall be current members of the WIBC Board as
designated by WIBC prior to the Effective Time. No other directors or
employees of BBCN or WIBC shall be designated to serve on the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. Subject to and
in accordance with the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation (as amended as set
forth in _Exhibit A_ ), effective as of the Effective Time, (i) the WIBC
chairman as of the date hereof shall serve as the Chairman of the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) the Wilshire Bank chairman as of the date hereof shall serve
as the Chairman of the board of directors of the Surviving Bank, (iii) the
BBCN Chief Executive Officer as of the date hereof shall serve as the Chief
Executive Officer and President of the Surviving Corporation, and (iv) the
BBCN Bank Chief Executive Officer as of the date hereof shall serve as the
Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Bank.

 

(b) BBCN and WIBC agree to select a name for the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Bank mutually acceptable to BBCN and WIBC as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement and by no later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day next preceding the date the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is first mailed in definitive form to the Parties
respective stockholders. Once the names have been selected pursuant to this
_Section 6.9(b)_, BBCN shall, and shall cause BBCN Bank to, take all actions
necessary, including by adopting, and causing BBCN Bank to adopt, an
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of BBCN and BBCN Bank,
respectively, to provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, each of the
names of the Surviving Corporation and BBCN Bank shall be changed to a
name mutually acceptable to WIBC and BBCN.

 



81 (c) Within five (5) business days following the execution of this Agreement,
the Parties shall establish a consolidation committee (the " _Consolidation
Committee_ ") consisting of three (3) individuals designated by WIBC and three
(3) individuals designated by BBCN. The Consolidation Committee shall
have responsibility for considering the development of strategic and
integration policies and procedures, coordinating consolidation and
integration related communications and overseeing managements efforts in the
integration of the WIBC and BBCN for the purpose of allowing WIBC and BBCN to
prepare to consummate the Merger and the Bank Merger and be in a position to
operate the Surviving Corporation and Surviving Bank upon the Closing. The
Consolidation Committee also shall have responsibility to determine the
remaining executive officers of the Surviving Corporation listed on _Schedule
6.9(c)_ to be appointed by the Surviving Corporation board of directors
effective, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as of immediately after
the Effective Time, based on the recommendations made by a majority vote of
the Consolidation Committee. The location of the headquarters and principal
executive offices of the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time,
also shall be determined by the Consolidation Committee as soon as reasonably
practicable prior to the Closing.

6.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of
WIBC or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of WIBC or any Subsidiary of WIBC, and pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by WIBC pursuant to WIBCs Articles of Incorporation,
By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any directors, officers and employees of WIBC and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by WIBC ( _provided_
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the premiums paid as of
the date hereof by WIBC for such insurance (" _WIBC s Current Premium_"), and
if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of WIBCs
Current

 



82  Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to 300% of WIBCs Current Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, WIBC, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of BBCN, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" policy or "extended discovery period" under WIBCs existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that does not exceed 300% of WIBCs Current Premium.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this _Section
6.10_.

 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 

6.11 _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent required by Applicable Legal
Requirements, BBCN and WIBC shall use commercially reasonable efforts (a) to
develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in
respect of any announcement required by Applicable Legal Requirements or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to
the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the
foregoing, except to the extent required by Applicable Legal Requirements,
disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1_ or as otherwise permitted
under _Section 5.4_, no Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement or disclosure concerning the other Party or the other
Partys business, financial condition or results of operations without the
consent of such other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Each Party shall provide the other Party with its stockholder
lists and allow and facilitate the other Partys contact with its stockholders
and prospective investors and following a Change in Recommendation by WIBC or
BBCN, as the case may be, such contacts may be made without regard to the
above limitations of this _Section 6.11_.

 



83 6.12 _Tax Matters_. (a) WIBC and BBCN each shall not, and shall not permit any
of their Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action, whether
before or after the Effective Time, which would reasonably be expected to
disqualify the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (b) WIBC and BBCN each agree to file all Tax Returns
consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

6.13 _Untrue Representations_. Each Party shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing if such notifying Party becomes aware of any fact or
condition that makes untrue, or shows to have been untrue, any schedule or any
other information furnished to the other Party or any representation or
warranty made in or pursuant to this Agreement or that results in the
notifying Partys failure to comply with any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of BBCN or WIBC to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ and _(b)_ and _Sections
7.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , respectively, to not be satisfied at the Closing;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to
the Parties hereunder.

6.14 _Litigation and Claims_. Each Party shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing of any threatened or commenced litigation, or of any claim,
controversy or contingent liability that might reasonably be expected to be
asserted or become the subject of litigation, against the notifying Party or
affecting any of its properties, Subsidiaries or affiliates and each Party
shall promptly notify the other Party of any legal action, suit or proceeding
or judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending or, to the
knowledge of the notifying Party, threatened against the notifying Party that

contemplated hereby, or any actions taken or to be taken by the notifying

restrain the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against such Party or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Party may enter into any settlement
agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation against such Party or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without other Partys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For purposes of
this _Section 6.14_, "participate" means that the non-litigating Party will
be kept apprised of the proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the litigation by the litigating Party (to the extent the attorney-
client privilege, work product or other similar privilege between the
litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and
the non-litigating Party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other
authority over the litigation except for the settlement consent set forth
above.

Corporations, the proper officers and directors of each Party shall take all
such necessary action.

6.16 _Disclosure Schedules_. At least ten (10) days prior to the Closing,
each Party agrees to provide the other Party with supplemental disclosure
schedules reflecting any material changes thereto between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date. Delivery of such supplemental disclosure
schedules shall not cure a breach or modify a representation or warranty of
this Agreement.

the stockholders of WIBC pursuant to this Agreement shall, on the issuance and
delivery to such stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The BBCN Common Stock to be
issued to the stockholders of WIBC pursuant to this Agreement are and shall
be free of any preemptive rights of any other Person, firm or entity. The BBCN
Common Stock to be issued to the stockholders of WIBC pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be subject to any restrictions on transfer arising under
the Securities Act, except for BBCN Common Stock issued to any former
stockholders of WIBC who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (under the
Exchange Act) of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time.

6.18 _Consulting Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, BBCN shall offer to enter
into a consulting agreement with the WIBC Chief Executive Officer as of the
date hereof pursuant to which, if such offer is accepted by such individual,

and all losses and damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise arising out of, or directly or
indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, and, upon receipt
of the BBCN Termination Fee in such circumstance, none of the BBCN Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in

the agreements contained in this  _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the

liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate WIBC and
BBCN, respectively, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without

or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any

waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any
waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific

product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any breaches in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties and may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected
in the text of this Agreement. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any employee benefit
plan of BBCN, WIBC or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
either of them, (ii) alter or limit the ability of BBCN, WIBC, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or
terminate any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them, (iii) confer
upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with BBCN,
WIBC or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or constitute
or create an employment agreement with or for any individual, or (iv) alter or
limit the ability of BBCN, WIBC or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to make necessary or appropriate changes to their respective
businesses in response to changed circumstances, unforeseen events or the
like. The disclosure in any correspondingly identified subsection of the
disclosure schedules delivered by BBCN or WIBC, as applicable, shall qualify
(i) the corresponding subsection of this Agreement and (ii) the other Sections
or subsections of this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such
other Sections or subsections. The BBCN SEC Documents and the WIBC SEC
Documents, as applicable, shall qualify the representations and warranties in
Article IV only to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it qualifies or applies to such representation or
warranty. The inclusion of any information in the BBCN SEC Documents and the
WIBC SEC Documents, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, constitutes or has resulted in or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or is
outside the ordinary course of business. 

9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and all disputes between the Parties under or related to this Agreement or
the facts and circumstances leading to its execution or performance, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware (except to the
extent that application of the "internal affairs doctrine" requires the
application of the internal laws of the State of California), without giving
effect to choice of law principles thereof.

 



95 9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the Parties
from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that
they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect
the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only as
broad as is enforceable.

 

9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by either of the
Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party, and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

9.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably submits
itself to the personal jurisdiction of all state and federal courts sitting
in the State of Delaware, including to the jurisdiction of all courts to which
an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any facts and circumstances
leading to its execution or performance, (ii) agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action, suit or proceeding must be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is declined by
or unavailable in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then such
action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
other state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from such courts, (iv) agrees not to bring
any action, suit or proceeding against the other Party or its Affiliates
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any facts and circumstances leading to its
execution or performance in any other courts, and (v) waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action, suit or proceeding so
brought. Each of the Parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect to any such
action, suit or proceeding, including any appeal thereof. Each of the Parties
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document in accordance
with _Section 9.2_ shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding brought against it by the other Party in connection with
this _Section 9.8_, provided that nothing contained herein shall affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

9.9 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving actual
monetary loss or posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court identified in  _Section 9.8_, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



96 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
DISPUTE WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, OR
RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_.
WITHOUT INTENDING IN ANY WAY TO LIMIT THE AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES SET FORTH
IN  _SECTIONS 9.5_ AND _9.8_ AND IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_ , IF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS FILED IN A COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY OR
AGAINST ANY PARTY, THE COURT SHALL, AND IS HEREBY DIRECTED TO, MAKE A GENERAL
REFERENCE PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 638 TO A
REFEREE (WHO SHALL BE A SINGLE ACTIVE OR RETIRED JUDGE) TO HEAR AND DETERMINE
ALL OF THE ISSUES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER OF FACT OR OF LAW)
AND TO REPORT A STATEMENT OF DECISION; _PROVIDED_ THAT AT THE OPTION OF ANY
PARTY TO SUCH PROCEEDING, ANY SUCH ISSUES PERTAINING TO A "PROVISIONAL REMEDY"
