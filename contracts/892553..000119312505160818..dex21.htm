vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 2, 2005 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made by and among Chart Industries, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), the shareholders of the Company set forth on
the _Principal Stockholders Schedule_ attached hereto (each a " _Principal
Stockholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Principal Stockholders_ "), First
Reserve Fund X, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Buyer_ "), and CI
Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Buyer (" _Merger Subsidiary_ ").



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Buyer, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company has approved, and deems it advisable and in the best interests of its
respective stockholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Buyer
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and



WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Principal Stockholder is the record
and/or beneficial owner of the number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Shares_ ") set forth opposite such
Principal Stockholders name on the  _Principal Stockholders Schedule_
attached hereto (together with all other Shares acquired by such Principal
Stockholder after the date hereof, the " _Principal Stockholder Shares_ " of
such Principal Stockholder).



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS



SECTION 1.01 _The Purchase and Sale_. On and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Stock Purchase Closing, each
Principal Stockholder shall sell and transfer to Merger Subsidiary, and Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Buyer shall take all actions necessary or advisable to
enable and cause Merger Subsidiary to, purchase from each Principal
Stockholder, all of the Principal Stockholder Shares then held by such
Principal Stockholder (the " _Stock Purchase_ "), for a purchase price per
Share (the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ ") equal to (a) $65.74, minus (b) the
result (rounded to the nearest cent) of (x) the aggregate amount of Company
Transaction Expenses, divided by (y) the sum of the number of Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the earlier of the Stock Purchase Closing
and the Effective Time plus the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of
Company Stock Options and Warrants outstanding immediately prior to
the earlier of the Stock Purchase Closing and the Effective Time. For purposes hereof, " _Company Transaction Expenses_ " means all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors (including any fees payable to
UBS) and accountants, incurred by the Company on or prior to the Merger
Closing Date in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding
(i) all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
Financing and (ii) all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the preparation of any information and/or materials to
be distributed after the Effective Time to the former holders of Shares in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL), as estimated in good faith by the
chief financial officer of the Company on the third day immediately preceding
the earlier of the Stock Purchase Closing Date and the Merger Closing Date
(the " _Determination Date_ ") based on the latest information then available,
which estimate of Company Transaction Expenses (together with a copy of the
information used to formulate such estimate) shall be provided to Buyer on
the Determination Date.



SECTION 1.02 _The Stock Purchase Closing_.



(a) _Stock Purchase Closing_. The closing of the Stock Purchase (the " _Stock
Purchase Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
200 E. Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois, commencing at 10:00 a.m. on the
second business day immediately following the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in SECTION 9.01 hereof (other than those that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Stock Purchase Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or at such other place and/or on such
other date as the Company and Buyer agree to in writing. The date on which the
Stock Purchase Closing is consummated is referred to herein as the " _Stock
Purchase Closing Date_."



(b) _Stock Purchase Closing Deliveries_. At the Stock Purchase Closing, (i)
each Principal Stockholder shall deliver to Merger Subsidiary one or more
certificate(s) representing the Principal Stockholder Shares to be sold by
such Principal Stockholder pursuant to SECTION 1.01 hereof, duly endorsed for
transfer or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, and (ii) Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Buyer shall take all actions necessary or advisable to
enable and cause Merger Subsidiary to, deliver to each Principal Stockholder,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by such Principal Stockholder, an aggregate amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the Per Share Purchase Price, multiplied by (y) the number
of Principal Stockholder Shares to be sold by such Principal Stockholder
pursuant to SECTION 1.01 hereof. __



SECTION 1.03 _Representations and Warranties of Principal Stockholders_. Each
Principal Stockholder, acting solely in its capacity as a holder of Shares
and not as a director or officer of the Company or in any other capacity,
hereby, severally and not jointly with any other Principal Stockholder,
represents and warrants as of the date hereof to Buyer and Merger Subsidiary
as follows: 



(a) _Title to the Shares_. Such Principal Stockholder owns the number of
Shares set forth opposite such Principal Stockholders name on the _Principal
Stockholders Schedule_ attached hereto, free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims and pledges. Such Principal Stockholder
has exclusive power to vote all of such Shares on all matters submitted to
holders of Shares.



 

8 (b) _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Such Principal Stockholder has all
necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Principal Stockholder and the consummation by such Principal Stockholder of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of such Principal Stockholder. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such
Principal Stockholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Buyer and Merger Subsidiary, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Principal Stockholder, enforceable against such
Principal Stockholder in accordance with its terms (i) except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) subject to general principles of equity. 



(c) _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Principal Stockholder does not, and the performance of this Agreement by such
Principal Stockholder will not, (i) require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
governmental or regulatory authority (other than the SEC), domestic or
foreign, by such Principal Stockholder or (ii) conflict with or violate any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such Principal
Stockholder.



SECTION 1.04 _Covenants of Principal Stockholders_.



(a) Each Principal Stockholder, acting solely in its capacity as a holder
of Shares and not as a director or officer of the Company or in any other
capacity, hereby, severally and not jointly with any other Principal
Stockholder, covenants and agrees during the time this Agreement is in effect
that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, such Principal Stockholder
shall not, and shall not offer or agree to, sell, transfer, tender, assign,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or create any security interest, lien,
claim or pledge with respect to, all or any portion of its Principal
Stockholder Shares, unless in each case (i) the transferee agrees in writing
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent
as the transferor and (ii) the transferee is an affiliate of such Principal
Stockholder, is an "accredited investor" (as defined in the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) or acquires all of the
Principal Stockholder Shares of such Principal Stockholder.



(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Principal Stockholder will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to promptly do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

9 ARTICLE II



THE MERGER



SECTION 2.01 _The Merger_.



(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the " _Merger_
") with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Stock Purchase and the
Merger are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Transaction_."



(b) Unless another date is agreed to in writing by the Company and Buyer, as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than five business days,
after satisfaction and/or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all
conditions set forth in SECTION 9.02 hereof (other than those that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), the Company and Merger Subsidiary will, and
Buyer shall cause the Company and Merger Subsidiary to, file (i) a certificate
of merger or (ii) in the event Merger Subsidiary shall own 90% or more of the
outstanding Shares, a certificate of ownership and merger (in either such
case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the
DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ ").



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject
to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL.



(d) The closing of the Merger (the " _Merger Closing_ ") shall take place on
the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Merger Closing Date_ "),
at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 200 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, IL,
60601, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Buyer.
At the Merger Closing, the Company shall, and Buyer shall take all actions
necessary or advisable to enable and cause the Company to, pay all unpaid out-
of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors (including any fees payable to
UBS) and accountants, incurred on or prior to the Merger Closing Date by the
Company.



(e) Notwithstanding any implication herein to the contrary, if, on the Merger
Closing Date, the Stock Purchase Closing has previously occurred but the
Principal Stockholder Shares owned by Merger Subsidiary represent less than
90% of the Shares then outstanding, then, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall issue to Merger Subsidiary, and Merger Subsidiary
shall, and Buyer shall take all actions necessary or advisable to enable and
cause Merger Subsidiary to, purchase from the Company, the lowest number of
Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares then
owned by Merger Subsidiary, shall represent one Share more than 90% of the
Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of such Top-Up
Shares), for a purchase price per Top-Up Share equal to the Per Share Purchase
Price. Concurrently with the issuance and purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (i)
the Company shall deliver to Merger Subsidiary a certificate representing the
Top-Up Shares, and (ii) Merger Subsidiary shall, and Buyer shall take all
actions necessary or advisable to enable and cause Merger Subsidiary to,
deliver to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company, an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Purchase Price, multiplied by (y)
the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to
this SECTION 2.01(e).



 

10 SECTION 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of Shares or
shares of the capital stock of Merger Subsidiary:



(a) Each share of capital stock of the Company held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by Buyer, Merger Subsidiary or any subsidiary of either
of them immediately prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation
all Shares acquired in the Stock Purchase and all Top-Up Shares acquired
pursuant to SECTION 2.01(e), shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto; 



(b) Each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights and privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and



(c) Each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
except as otherwise provided in clause (a) above or as provided in SECTION
2.04 with respect to Shares as to which appraisal rights have been exercised,
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Purchase Price or, if
greater, the price per Share paid in the Stock Purchase, in cash without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive upon the surrender of such certificates,
the Merger Consideration.



SECTION 2.03  _Exchange of Shares_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint an agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purposes of
exchanging certificates representing Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this SECTION 2.03 and exchanging certificates representing
certain Warrants for Warrant Consideration in accordance with SECTION 2.06.
Buyer will, at the Effective Time, deposit with the Exchange Agent, the full
amount of the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Shares. For
purposes of determining the Merger Consideration to be so deposited, Buyer
shall assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect his right to
appraisal of his, her or its Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and related instructions for use
in such exchange.



(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate
or certificates representing such Shares (or evidence of loss in lieu
thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering
such Shares, will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Shares and the certificate or certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith



 

11 be cancelled; _provided_ that in no event will a holder of a certificate or
certificates be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration if the Merger
Consideration was already paid with respect to the Shares underlying such
certificate or certificates in connection with an affidavit of loss. Until so
surrendered, each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Share
is to be paid to a person other than the registered holder of the
Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Shares or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to SECTION 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Shares entitled thereto six months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Buyer, upon demand, and any stockholder of the Company who has not
exchanged his Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
SECTION 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Buyer for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of his Shares. None of Buyer,
Merger Subsidiary or the Company shall be liable to any holder of the Shares
for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to SECTION 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
shall have been perfected shall be returned to Buyer, upon demand.



(g) In the event that any certificate representing Shares shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such certificate (provided that, if such
person is a financial institution or other institutional investor, its own
agreement shall be satisfactory), the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to such certificate, to which such person is entitled pursuant hereto.



SECTION 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding SECTION 2.02,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing, if any such vote or consent is required, and who has demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right
to appraisal. At the



 

12 Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive, subject to and net of any applicable withholding of
Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares held by them
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right
to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such Shares pursuant to SECTION 2.02, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Buyer shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.



SECTION 2.05 _Company Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each stock option, stock equivalent right or other
right to acquire Shares granted under the Chart Industries, Inc. 2004 Stock
Option and Incentive Plan or the Chart Industries, Inc. 2004 Stock Option Plan
for Outside Directors (each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether then vested or
exercisable, but excluding any Company Stock Options, or portions thereof, for
which a Rollover Election has been delivered in accordance with SECTION
2.05(b)) shall be canceled in the Merger. Thereafter, no holder of any such
Company Stock Option shall have any rights in respect thereof, other than the
right to receive therefor an amount in cash from the Company at the Merger
Closing, and the Company shall, and Buyer shall take all actions necessary or
advisable to enable and cause the Company to, pay an amount in cash at the
Merger Closing to such holder in respect of such Company Stock Option, equal
to the product of (i) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming,
for this purpose, that such Company Stock Option is fully vested
and exercised for cash) and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Stock
Option, less any required withholding taxes. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all action necessary to effect the foregoing.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in SECTION 2.05(a) to the contrary, the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the " _Committee_ ") may elect, by
delivering written notice to Buyer and one or more employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary holding any Company Stock Option (each an " _Eligible
Optionee_ ") at least 10 days prior to the Merger Closing (a " _Rollover
Election_ "), to have all or any portion of the Company Stock Options held by
such Eligible Optionee(s) and which remain outstanding as of the Effective
Time adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plans and SECTION 2.05(c)
below to represent stock options to acquire shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation (each a " _Rollover Option_ "), on the same terms and
conditions applicable to such Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof)
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that: (i) unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by such Eligible Optionee prior to the Effective Time,
each such Rollover Option shall vest in the manner that was due to occur under
the terms of such corresponding Company Stock Option(s) before or at the
Effective Time; and (ii) to the extent the Committee elects to have any



 

13 Company Stock Option that was granted with an exercise price per share less
than the per share fair market value of the Shares underlying such Company
Stock Option on the grant date thereof (each a " _Discount Option_ "), and
which remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
adjusted into a Rollover Option in accordance with the terms of the Plans and
SECTION 2.05(c) below, then immediately prior to the Effective Time, such
Discount Option shall be modified in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
Notice 2005-1, QandA 18(d) (any Discount Option so modified is referred to
herein as a " _Replacement Option_ ") by increasing the aggregate exercise
price of such Discount Option by an amount equal to the excess of (A) the
aggregate fair market value of the Shares underlying such Discount Option on
the grant date thereof over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Discount
Options on the grant date thereof (such excess, the " _Aggregate Original
Option Spread_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action necessary to effect the foregoing.



(c) The adjustment of any Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof)
(including any Replacement Option(s)) into a Rollover Option shall be effected
in a manner such that: (i) the excess of the aggregate fair market value of
the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation subject to such
Rollover Option immediately following such adjustment over the aggregate
exercise price of such Rollover Option immediately following such adjustment
shall be equal to the aggregate amount of cash to which the holder of such
corresponding Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof) would have been
entitled pursuant to SECTION 2.05(a) (before any reduction for withholding
taxes) in respect of such Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof) had
such Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof) been cancelled in
accordance with such section (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
Replacement Option(s), the "aggregate amount of cash to which the holder of
such corresponding Company Stock Option(s) (or portions thereof) would have
been entitled pursuant to SECTION 2.05(a)" shall be determined after giving
effect to the increase in the exercise price of such Replacement Option(s)
pursuant to the proviso in SECTION 2.05(b) above); and (ii) all of the other
requirements of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.424-1, as modified by Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-1, QandA 4(d), are intended to be satisfied.



(d) Each Eligible Optionee who holds a Discount Option that the Committee
has elected to adjust into a Rollover Option in accordance with SECTION
2.05(b) shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash from the Company at the
Merger Closing, and the Company shall, and Buyer shall take all actions
necessary or advisable to enable and cause the Company to, pay an amount in
cash at the Merger Closing to such Eligible Optionee, equal to the Aggregate
Original Option Spread for such Discount Option, less any required withholding
taxes. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to effect the foregoing.



SECTION 2.06 _Warrants_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant issued pursuant to that certain
Warrant Agreement (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), dated September 15, 2003,
between the Company and National City Bank, as Warrant Agent (the " _Warrants_
"), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled in the Merger. Thereafter, no holder of any such Warrant shall have
any rights in respect thereof, other than the right to receive



 

14 therefor in accordance with this SECTION 2.06 an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming, for this
purpose, that such Warrant is exercised for cash) and (ii) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such
Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the foregoing.



 

(b) Buyer will, at the Effective Time, deposit with the Exchange Agent, the
full amount of the Warrant Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Warrants. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer will send, or will
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Warrants at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and related instructions for the exchange of
certificates representing Warrants for the Warrant Consideration payable in
respect thereof. Each holder of Warrants, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a certificate or certificates representing such Warrants (or evidence of
loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal covering such Warrants, will be entitled to receive the Warrant
Consideration payable in respect of such Warrants, and the certificate or
certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled;  _provided_ that in
no event will a holder of a certificate or certificates representing Warrants
be entitled to receive the Warrant Consideration if the Warrant Consideration
was already paid with respect to the Warrants underlying such certificate or
certificates in connection with an affidavit of loss. Until so surrendered,
each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive such Warrant Consideration.



(c) If any portion of the Warrant Consideration payable in respect of
any Warrant is to be paid to a person other than the registered holder of the
Warrant represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such Warrants or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 



(e) Any portion of the Warrant Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to SECTION 2.06(b) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Warrants entitled thereto six months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Buyer, upon demand, and any warrantholder of the Company who has
not exchanged his Warrants for the Warrant Consideration in accordance with
this SECTION 2.06 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Buyer for
payment of the Warrant Consideration in respect of his Warrants. None of
Buyer, Merger Subsidiary or the Company shall be liable to any holder of the
Warrants for any Warrant Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(f) In the event that any certificate representing Warrants shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such



 

15 certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such certificate (provided that, if such person is a financial institution
or other institutional investor, its own agreement shall be satisfactory),
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the Warrant Consideration with respect to such certificate, to
which such person is entitled pursuant hereto.

ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Buyer at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") or as expressly disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed with SEC prior to the date hereof, the Company represents and
warrants to Buyer and Merger Subsidiary that:



SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 



(a) Each of the Company and each Material Subsidiary is a
corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite power
and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the



 

16 failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power, authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Material Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed as foreign corporations to
do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by them or the nature of
their business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change,
condition, circumstance or effect that is, or is reasonably likely to be,
materially adverse to the assets and liabilities (taken together), business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than changes, conditions, circumstances
or effects that are the result of (i) economic factors affecting the economy
or financial markets as a whole or generally affecting any of the industries
and markets in which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries operates,
(ii) natural disasters, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, military actions
or the escalation thereof, (iii) any change in applicable laws, rules or
regulations or accounting rules or (iv) actions contemplated by the parties in
connection with this Agreement or the announcement or performance of this
Agreement, except that the exclusions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
shall only be effective if the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, are not substantially, disproportionately impacted in financial terms
by such events when compared to other companies in the industries in which
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate).



(b) For purposes hereof, " _Material Subsidiary_ " means a subsidiary (as
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")) of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_
") that constitutes a "significant subsidiary" of the Company within the
meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.



SECTION 4.02 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has
heretofore made available to Buyer a complete and correct copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary. Such Certificates of Incorporation, Bylaws and equivalent
organizational documents are in full force and effect.



SECTION 4.03 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 9,500,000 Shares and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of July 18, 2005, (a)
5,360,409 Shares were outstanding and (b) no shares of Preferred Stock were
outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. As
of July 18, 2005, Warrants to purchase 249,983 Shares were outstanding at an
exercise price of $32.97 per Share (subject to adjustment). SECTION 4.03 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of all
outstanding Company Stock Options as of the date hereof, the exercise price
for each such Company Stock Option as of the date hereof and the holders of
each such Company Stock Option as of the date hereof. As of March 31, 2005,
729,080 Shares were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
Company Stock Options and Warrants, which consisted of (i) Company Stock
Options to purchase 477,701 Shares at a weighted average exercise price of
$18.18 per Share (subject to adjustment) and (ii) Warrants to purchase 251,379
Shares at an exercise price of $32.97 per Share (subject to



 

17 adjustment) pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, and, except for such Company
Stock Options and Warrants, no preemptive rights, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell, or to
cause to be issued or sold, any shares of capital stock of, other equity
interests in, or rights to acquire equity interests in, the Company or any
Material Subsidiary were outstanding. Other than with respect to the Company
Subsidiaries listed on SECTION 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company does not directly or indirectly own any securities or other beneficial
ownership interests in any other entity (including through joint ventures or
partnership arrangements) representing more than 5% of the beneficial
ownership interests of such entity, or have any similar equity investment in
any other person. There are no material outstanding contractual obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Shares or any capital stock of any Material Subsidiary, or to make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in
any Company Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of capital stock or other
equity interest of each Company Subsidiary is validly issued and, with respect
to each outstanding share of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary that is a
domestic corporation, fully paid, and each such share owned by the Company or
another Company Subsidiary is free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements imposing
restrictions on assets, limitations on the Companys or such other
Company Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever (" _Encumbrances_ ") other than any such encumbrances
imposed by applicable law (including securities laws). Except as otherwise
expressly contemplated by SECTION 2.05 hereof, following the consummation of
the Merger, there will not be outstanding any rights, warrants, options or
other securities entitling the holder thereof to purchase, acquire or
otherwise receive any shares of the capital stock of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (or any other securities exercisable for or
convertible into such shares). Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company or any Company Subsidiary on any matter or any
agreements with respect to which Company stockholders, as such, have the
right to vote.



SECTION 4.04 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding Shares and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally
and to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of the transactions contemplated herein by the Company
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, result in the loss of a material benefit under, or give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of an Encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or
Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or such Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company or such Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not prevent or delay consummation of the
Merger in any material respect, or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, or
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (provided that, for purposes of this SECTION 4.05(a), the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include the exclusion in clause
(iv) thereof).



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (each a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), except (i) for (A) applicable requirements, if any,

sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, (B) the pre-merger

the DGCL and (D) applicable requirements, if any, of any non-United States
competition, antitrust and investment laws and (ii) where failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in
any material respect, or otherwise prevent the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, or would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (provided that, for purposes of this SECTION 4.05(b), the definition
of Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include the exclusion in clause
(iv) thereof).



  

19 SECTION 4.06 _Compliance_.



(a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, (i) any material law, statute, ordinance, writ,
injunction, settlement agreement, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree
(including, without limitation, material laws, rules and regulations relating
to franchises) applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement,
lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Except for such deficiencies that would not individually or in the
aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has duly obtained all material permits, consents, concessions,
grants, franchises, licenses and other governmental authorizations, agreements
and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ") required under any applicable law,
statute, ordinance, writ, injunction, settlement agreement, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree in order to conduct the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as conducted on the date hereof, each Permit is in
full force and effect, and there are no proceedings pending or to the
knowledge of the Company threatened which could result in the revocation,
cancellation, suspension or modification of any Permit. For purposes of this
Agreement, "knowledge" of the Company means the actual knowledge of Samuel F.
Thomas, Michael F. Biehl and Mark Ludwig and the knowledge that such
individuals would reasonably be expected to have upon reasonable inquiry.



(c) This SECTION 4.06 does not address compliance with, or Permits required
under, Environmental Laws, which are addressed solely in SECTION 4.18. 



SECTION 4.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. 



(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC since September 15, 2003 (the " _Company SEC Reports_
") and has heretofore made available to Buyer, in the form filed with the SEC
(excluding any exhibits thereto), the Company SEC Reports. The Company SEC
Reports and any forms, reports and other documents filed by the Company with
the SEC after the date of this Agreement (x) were or will be prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act

thereunder and (y) did not at the time they were filed, or will not at the
time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order

40 SECTION 6.03 _No Solicitation_.



(a) Subject to SECTION 6.03(b) below, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and each officer, director or employee of the Company, and
any investment banker, attorney or other representative of the Company not to,
take or cause, directly or indirectly, any of the following actions after the
date hereof with any party other than Buyer, Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective designees or representatives: (i) solicit, knowingly
encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with respect to any offer, indication or proposal to acquire more
than 20% of its business, assets or capital stock whether by merger,
consolidation, other business combination, purchase of assets, tender or
exchange offer or otherwise (each of the foregoing, an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ ") or (ii) disclose, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
any information or provide access to its properties, books or records, except
as required by law or pursuant to a governmental request for information.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in SECTION 6.03(a)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the earlier of the Stock Purchase
Closing and the Effective Time, the Company may, to the extent the Companys
Board of Directors (the " _Board_ "), after consultation with outside
counsel, determines in good faith that it would be required to do so in the
proper exercise of its fiduciary duties, participate in discussions or
negotiations with, and furnish non-public information and afford access to the
properties, books, records, officers, employees and representatives of the
Company to any person, entity or group after such person, entity or group has
delivered to the Company, in writing, a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal for a majority of the Companys business assets or capital stock
which the Board, after consultation with and taking into account the advice of
UBS or another independent, nationally recognized financial advisor,
determines in good faith that, if consummated, would be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Superior Proposal_ "). In the event the
Company receives a Superior Proposal prior to the earlier of the Stock
Purchase Closing and the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Agreement
(but subject to the terms of this paragraph (b)) will prevent the Company or
any of its stockholders (including, without limitation, any of the
Principal Stockholders) from executing or entering into an agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal or prevent the Board from recommending such Superior
Proposal to its stockholders, if the Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, determines in good faith that it would be required to do so in the
proper exercise of its fiduciary duties; in such case, the Board may withdraw,
modify or refrain from making its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the extent it does so, the Company
may refrain from calling, providing notice of or holding a meeting of its
stockholders to adopt this Agreement or from soliciting proxies or consents to
secure the vote or written consent of its stockholders to adopt this
Agreement, if any such meeting, vote and/or consent is otherwise required, and
may terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
provide Buyer at least two business days prior written notice (together with
a complete copy of the relevant agreement and any subsequent amendment
thereto) of the Companys intention to execute or enter into an agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal and shall provide Buyer the



 

41 opportunity to submit revised proposals to it during this period of at least
two business days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
SECTION 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in connection with an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, refer the third party making
such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to this SECTION 6.03 and SECTION
10.03(b) and make a copy of this SECTION 6.03 and SECTION 10.03(b) available
to a third party.



 

(c) Upon receiving any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify
Buyer thereof and provide to Buyer a copy of the correspondence
and documents, if any, related to such Acquisition Proposal.



SECTION 6.04 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify
Buyer of, and, except as prohibited by applicable law, provide the

the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



(b) any notice or other communication from any governmental or regulatory
agency or authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by

applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the
members of the Board, subject to their fiduciary duties and to the extent
applicable under such state takeover statute, shall grant such approvals and

hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such state
takeover statute on the transactions contemplated hereby.



SECTION 6.06 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Stock Purchase Closing Date,
the Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may
be required and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to such Shares) by each individual who is or will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.



SECTION 6.07 _Financing_. Between the date hereof and the Stock Purchase
Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause

Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing. Notwithstanding any of

other cooperation, or take any other action, under this SECTION 6.07 which
would materially interfere with the business or operations of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries or violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. If this Agreement is terminated without

COVENANTS OF BUYER

obtained by or on behalf of Buyer (including by Merger Subsidiary)
in connection with the Transaction shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.



SECTION 7.02 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation_.

and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Buyer will take all action
necessary to cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under
this Agreement as of and after the Effective Time.



SECTION 7.03  _Director and Officer Liability_.



(a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and limitation of
liability set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by
law. 



(b) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
all losses, expenses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid
in settlement of, with the approval of the Surviving Corporation (which
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or otherwise incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "
_Claim_ "), based in whole or in part by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of the Company and arising out of actions,
events or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), in each case to the full extent permitted under the DGCL (and
shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under
the DGCL, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced of the undertaking to repay such advances contemplated by Section
145(e) of the DGCL).



(c) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought
against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time) after the Effective Time (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain the
Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other independent
legal counsel satisfactory to them, provided that such other counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall



 

44 pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement of any Claim effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this SECTION 7.03 upon learning
of any such Claim shall notify the Surviving Corporation (although the failure
to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving
Corporation from any liability which the Surviving Corporation may have under
this SECTION 7.03, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
Surviving Corporations position with respect to such claim), and shall
deliver to the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section
145(e) of the DGCL. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain no more than
one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to
each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional

conflict between the interests of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in
which event such additional counsel as may be required may be retained by the
Indemnified Parties.



(d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the liability insurance
policies for directors and officers which are currently maintained by the
Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
(including, at the Surviving Corporations option, "tail" coverage policies)
containing terms no less favorable to such former directors or officers.



(e) Each Indemnified Party shall have rights as a third party
beneficiary under this SECTION 7.03 as separate contractual rights for his or
her benefit and such right shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Party, his
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. If
requested by an Indemnified Party, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall
enter into an indemnity agreement with such Indemnified Party evidencing

agreement, for at least one year after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain or provide the employees of the

and the Company Subsidiaries on the date hereof (excluding, in each case,
equity incentives and retiree welfare benefits). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to (i) provide or consider any employee
benefits related to or denominated in the equity securities of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation; (ii) continue or maintain any particular Plan, or

the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound.



(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
accrual (other than the accrual of benefits under any defined benefit
pension plan) where length of service is relevant under any employee benefit
plan or arrangement of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries, employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time shall receive service credit for service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the same extent such service credit
was granted under the Companys benefit plans, subject, in the case of defined
benefit arrangements, to offsets for previously accrued benefits and no
duplication of benefits.



(c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
will coordinate with Buyer regarding the implementation of any changes to any
Plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans (within the meaning of
Code Section 409A) which the Company determines to be necessary to comply
with Code Section 409A. Following the Effective Date, Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to amend, reform or
supplement the terms of any nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within
the meaning of Code Section 409A and related guidance) covering any Employee
in a manner intended to comply with, and avoid adverse tax consequences under,
Code Section 409A, while preserving to the extent practicable the intended
treatment of the original plan.



(d) Nothing herein is intended to, or shall be construed to, create any third
party beneficiary rights of any kind or nature, including, without limitation,
the right of any Employee or director or other individual to seek to enforce
any right to compensation, benefits, or any other right or privilege of
employment with the Buyer or any of its affiliates.



SECTION 7.05 _Notices of Certain Events_. Buyer shall promptly notify the
Company of, and, except as prohibited by applicable law, provide
the correspondence and documents, if any, related to:



(a) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the

TERMINATION; EXPENSES



SECTION 10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transaction abandoned at any time prior to the earlier of the Stock
Purchase Closing and the Effective Time (notwithstanding any approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):



(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer;



(b) by either Buyer or the Company, if any permanent injunction or action by
any Governmental Entity preventing the consummation of the Stock Purchase
or the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable;



(c) by either Buyer or the Company, if neither the Stock Purchase nor the
Merger shall have occurred before November 30, 2005 (the " _Termination Date_
"); _provided_ that (i) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion by
providing written notice of such election to Buyer, to extend the Termination
Date to December 31, 2005, if any of the conditions set forth in SECTION
9.01(f), 9.01(h), 9.02(g) and/or 9.02(i) have not been satisfied or waived
prior to the original Termination Date and (ii) the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended to December 31, 2005, if the condition set forth in
SECTION 9.01(m) or 9.02(a) has not been satisfied prior to the original
Termination Date and all of the other conditions set forth in SECTIONS 9.01
and 9.02 (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Stock Purchase Closing or Merger Closing, as applicable) have been satisfied
or waived; _provided_ , _further_ , the right to terminate this Agreement
under this SECTION 10.01(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill an obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Stock Purchase to be completed or the Merger
to be consummated on or before the Termination Date;



(d) by either Buyer or the Company, if the Merger shall fail to receive the
requisite vote, if any such vote is required, for approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
SECTION 10.01(d) if the Stock Purchase Closing has occurred.



(e) by the Company, if the Board determines to accept a Superior Proposal in
compliance with the provisions of SECTION 6.03; or



(f) by Buyer, prior to the Stock Purchase Closing, if: (i) the Board
shall have withdrawn or materially and adversely modified its recommendation
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood, however, that for all purposes of this Agreement, the fact that
the Company has supplied any person with information regarding the



 

52 Company or has entered into discussions or negotiations with such person as
permitted by this Agreement, or the disclosure of such facts, shall not be
deemed a withdrawal or modification of the Boards recommendation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); (ii) the Board shall have
recommended to the stockholders of the Company that they approve an
Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer that, if successful,
would result in any person or "group" becoming a "beneficial owner" (such
terms having the meaning in this Agreement as is ascribed under Regulation 13D
under the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the outstanding Shares is commenced
(other than by Buyer or an affiliate of Buyer) and the Board recommends that
the stockholders of the Company tender their Shares in such tender or
exchange offer.



The rights of Buyer and the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this SECTION 10.01 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any
person controlling or controlled by any such party or any of their respective
officers or directors, whether prior to or after the execution of this
Agreement.



SECTION 10.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to SECTION 10.01, this Agreement shall immediately terminate with no
liability on the part of any party hereto, except that the agreements
contained in SECTIONS 7.01, 10.03 and Article XI shall survive the termination
hereof, and except that each party shall be liable for its willful breaches
of this Agreement or willful failure by such party to perform its obligations
hereunder prior to the time of such termination.



SECTION 10.03 _Fees, Expenses and Other Payments_.



(a) All out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees
and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants,
incurred directly or indirectly by the parties hereto in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party which has
incurred such costs and expenses (with respect to such party, its " _Expenses_
"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if the Stock Purchase is completed or the
Merger is consummated, all Expenses of the Principal Stockholders and the
Company shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _further_ ,
if this Agreement is terminated without the Stock Purchase being completed or
the Merger being consummated, all filing fees under the HSR Act shall be borne
equally by the Company and Buyer, unless Buyer has materially breached any of
its obligations hereunder prior to such termination (in which case Buyer
shall be responsible for 100% of such fees).



(b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
or Buyer pursuant to SECTION 10.01(d) or by the Company pursuant to SECTION
10.01(c) (unless, in either case, Buyer has materially breached any of its
obligations hereunder prior to such termination) and (A) an Acquisition
Proposal was publicly announced, proposed, offered or made to the Company or
its stockholders after the date hereof and before such termination, (B)
such Acquisition Proposal has not expired or been withdrawn at the time of
such termination and (C) the Company enters into an agreement with respect to
or consummates an Acquisition Proposal within twelve months following such
termination, (ii) by the Company pursuant to SECTION 10.01(e), or (iii) by
Buyer pursuant to SECTION 10.01(f), then the



 

53 Company shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the result of (I) (x) 3%,
multiplied by (y) the sum of (A) the product of (1) the Per Share Purchase
Price (provided that, for purposes of this SECTION 10.03(b) only, the Per
Share Purchase Price shall be calculated as if the Merger occurred on the date
of such termination) and (2) the number of Shares outstanding as of the date
of such termination and (B) the aggregate amount that would be due under
SECTIONS 2.05 and 2.06 if the Merger occurred on the date of such termination
(such sum, the " _Base Amount_ ") plus (II) all documented, third-party out-
of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer and Merger
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, those reasonably incurred in connection with
the Financing);  _provided_ that the aggregate amount payable pursuant to
this SECTION 10.03(b) shall not exceed 3.5% of the Base Amount.



(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to SECTION 10.03(b)(i) shall be
made contemporaneously with the earlier of the entry into the agreement
or the consummation of the relevant Acquisition Proposal, any payment
required to be made pursuant to SECTION 10.03(b)(ii) shall be made
contemporaneously with the Companys termination of this Agreement and any
payment required to be made pursuant to SECTION 10.03(b)(iii) shall be made
as promptly as practicable after Buyers termination of this Agreement, in
each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer.

(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE

or their representatives or agents by any other electronic means.



SECTION 11.04 _Amendments; No Waivers_.



(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the

signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Buyer, Merger Subsidiary
and the Principal Stockholder(s) who hold at least a majority of the Shares
set forth on the _Principal Stockholders Schedule_ attached hereto (the "
_Required Holder(s)_ ") or in the case of a waiver, by Buyer if such waiver is
to be effective against Buyer and/or Merger Subsidiary, by the Company if
such waiver is to be effective against the Company, or by the Required
Holder(s) if such waiver is to be effective against the Principal
Stockholders; _provided_ that, if any such amendment or waiver by its terms
treats disproportionately any Principal Stockholder in an adverse manner
relative to any other Principal Stockholder, then such amendment or waiver
shall require the prior written approval of such Principal Stockholder so
disproportionately and adversely treated; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no
such amendment or waiver shall, without the approval of the stockholders,
alter or change (i) the amount or kind of consideration to be received in
exchange for any shares of capital stock of the Company, (ii) any term of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or (iii) any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change would
adversely affect the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company.

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.



SECTION 11.05 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto.



 

57 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Buyer and Merger Subsidiary may assign
their rights and obligations hereunder to an affiliate upon the consent of
the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (b) each of
the Principal Stockholders may assign its respective rights and obligations
hereunder with respect to all or any portion of its respective Shares to any
transferee of such Shares, provided that (i) the transferee is an affiliate of
such Principal Stockholder, is an "accredited investor" (as defined in the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder)
or acquires all of the Principal Stockholder Shares of such Principal
Stockholder, and (ii) prior to such transfer, the transferee agrees in writing
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent
as the transferor. 



SECTION 11.06 _Governing Law_.



(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed in
all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the law of
the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.



(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered
in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or
Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in SECTION 11.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE



 

58 EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.06(c).



SECTION 11.07 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature.



SECTION 11.08 _Headings_. Section headings used in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall be ignored in the construction and interpretation
hereof.



SECTION 11.09 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for SECTION 7.03 (which
is intended to and shall confer upon the persons referenced therein all
rights and remedies by reason of this Agreement as if such person was a party
hereto), no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or shall, confer any
third party beneficiary or other rights or remedies upon any person other
than the parties hereto.



SECTION 11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto and thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreements of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.



SECTION 11.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.



SECTION 11.12 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
