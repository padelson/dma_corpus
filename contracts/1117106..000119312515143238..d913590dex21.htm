Transaction Documents, and each party was (or had ample opportunity to be) represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and each party and each party&#146;s counsel has reviewed and revised (or
had ample opportunity to review and revise) this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Consequently, if an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms hereof or thereof, and as such, the parties therefore agree that the provisions
of <U>Section&nbsp;1654</U> of the California Civil Code, and any similar provision of the law of any other jurisdiction, shall not apply to the interpretation of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents. </P>

contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements referenced in this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Cooley LLP will be permitted to represent the
Securityholders (or the Securityholder Representative on their behalf), any of their agents and affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other
adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their agents or affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with respect to any indemnification claims. Upon and after the Closing, the Surviving Company will cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Cooley LLP, unless and to the
extent Cooley LLP is specifically engaged in writing by the Surviving Company to represent the Surviving Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Securityholders or the Securityholder
Representative consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving Company by Cooley LLP after the Closing will not affect the foregoing provisions of this Agreement. </P>
