This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of
the 3rd day of October 2011, by and among Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Buyer"), Matte Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (the "Merger Sub"),
Gluster, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and solely with respect
to the express references set forth herein, Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company solely in its capacity as the holder agent (the
"Holder Agent"). Capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in _Article
VIII_ of this Agreement.

_RECITALS_

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporation and the stockholders thereof that the Company be
acquired by Buyer, and, in furtherance thereof, that Merger Sub merge with
and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer. Pursuant to the Merger, the issued and outstanding shares
of the Companys capital stock will be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration as set forth herein.

B. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of Buyer and Merger
Sub to enter into this Agreement: (i) the Major Holders (a) have entered into
Stockholder Agreements with Buyer in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the "Stockholder Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other
things, such Major Holders have agreed to vote and take certain actions
required by such Stockholder Agreements for the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) will, promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, execute and deliver
stockholder written consents with respect to their shares of Company capital
stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger and if such Major Holder is a holder of Preferred Shares,
requesting the conversion of such Preferred Shares into Common Shares; (ii)
certain stockholders of the Company will, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, enter into Non-Competition Agreements
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Non-Competition
Agreements") and (iii) certain employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
will concurrently with, or immediately following, the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, enter into Retention Agreements substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "Retention Agreements").

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements contained herein, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged by each of the Parties, and intending to be legally bound,
the Parties hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company at the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

1.2 _The Closing_. The Closing shall take place on or prior to October 7, 2011
provided that the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article V_ hereof (other than the conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) has occurred or, if such conditions have not been
satisfied or waived on or prior to October 7, 2011, at such later date
promptly following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in _Article V_ hereof (the "Closing Date") at the offices of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 950 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California
94304, commencing at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time on the Closing Date or at such
other time and place as the parties hereto shall mutually agree in writing.

 

1.3 _Actions at the Closing_. At the Closing: (i) the Company shall deliver to
Buyer and Merger Sub each of the certificates, instruments and documents
referred to in _Section 5.2_; (ii) Buyer and Merger Sub shall deliver to the
Company each of the certificates and instruments referred to in _Section
5.3_; (iii) Buyer shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (iv) Buyer shall pay (by wire
transfer) to the Payment Agent an aggregate of $124,850,000 (rounded up to the
nearest $0.01) representing the portion of the Merger Consideration payable
at the Closing to the holders of Company Shares and Vested Options and after
giving effect to the deposit of (A) the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent
and (B) the Holder Agent Fund Amount in the Holder Agent Fund; (v) subject to
the adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)(ii)_,
Buyer shall pay the Company Holder Transaction Costs and any Indebtedness of
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in accordance with a certificate of the
chief executive officer of the Company delivered to Buyer at least one (1) day
prior to Closing, certifying the Company Holder Transaction Costs and the
Indebtedness of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (such
certificate shall be deemed a representation and warranty of the Company for
purposes of _Article VI_ of this Agreement), (vi) Buyer shall deposit an
aggregate of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) representing the
Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.10_ and
(vii) Buyer shall wire an aggregate of $150,000 representing the Holder Agent
Fund Amount to an account designated by the Holder Agent in a written notice
delivered to Buyer at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date. The
Vested Option Consideration shall be paid in accordance with _Section
1.8(b)_.

1.4 _Additional Action_. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the
Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

1.5  _Calculation of Merger Consideration and Conversion of Shares_.

 



\- 2 -  (a) _Conversion of Outstanding Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the
holder of any of the following securities, each Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to the
Preferred Share Conversion (other than Dissenting Shares and Common Shares
held in the Companys treasury) shall be converted into, and represent the
right to receive, an amount in cash per Common Share equal to the Conversion
Ratio subject to the provisions of _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.14_.

(b) _Treasury Shares_. Each Company Share held in the Companys treasury
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Company Share owned
beneficially by Buyer or Merger Sub shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor.

 

(c) _Merger Sub Shares_. Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one (1) share
of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Definitions_.

(i) "Conversion Ratio" means the quotient obtained from dividing (i) the
Merger Consideration by (ii) the sum of (A) the number of Common Shares (other
than Restricted Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the number of Common Shares issued upon conversion (in accordance
with the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of all
Preferred Shares to be effected immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of all Vested Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(ii) "Merger Consideration" means (i) One Hundred Forty Million Dollars
($140,000,000),  _ _minus__ (ii) the sum of (A) the Closing Date AWC
Deficiency (if any), (B) the Company Holder Transaction Costs and (C) any
Indebtedness of the Company, __plus__ (iii) the Closing Date AWC Excess
(if any). For the avoidance of doubt, the Vested Option Consideration is a
component of, and included in, the Merger Consideration.

1.6 _Working Capital Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 1.5(d)(ii)_ shall be subject to
adjustment as follows:

 

(a) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a certificate in the form set forth on _Schedule
1.6(a)_ (the "Adjusted Working Capital Certificate") executed by the chief
executive officer on behalf of the Company that sets forth, among other things
(i) the Companys good faith estimate of the Adjusted Working Capital (the
"Estimated Adjusted Working Capital") calculated in accordance with the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (as defined below) which shall include
detailed supporting information in the form set forth on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ ;
and (ii) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company reflecting the Companys
good faith estimate of the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the
close of business on the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP on a
consistent basis with the Audited Financial Statements (the "Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet").

 



\- 3 -  (b) If (i) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital is __less__  than Three
Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,200,000) (such difference, the
"Closing Date AWC Deficiency"), then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced
by an amount equal to such Closing Date AWC Deficiency. If the Estimated
Adjusted Working Capital __exceeds__ Three Million Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($3,200,000) (such excess, the "Closing Date AWC Excess"), then the
Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to such Closing
Date AWC Excess.

(c) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the
Holder Agent a certificate in the form set forth on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ (the
"Draft Adjusted Working Capital Certificate") executed on behalf of Buyer by
the chief financial officer that sets forth, among other things, (i) Buyers
good faith calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital (the "Draft Adjusted
Working Capital") calculated in accordance with the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet (as defined below) which shall include detailed supporting information
in the form set forth on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ ; and (ii) a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company reflecting Buyers good faith calculation of the assets
and liabilities of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing
Date prepared in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with the Audited
Financial Statements (the "Draft Closing Balance Sheet"). Buyer shall promptly
provide the Holder Agent with reasonable access to such Company personnel,
Buyer personnel and its representatives that were involved in the preparation
of the Draft Adjusted Working Capital Certificate and the Draft Closing
Balance Sheet and such books and records reasonably related to the
Draft Adjusted Working Capital Certificate and the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet that the Holder Agent may reasonably request. The Holder Agent shall
deliver to Buyer, on or before the date that is thirty (30) days following the
delivery of the Draft Adjusted Working Capital and the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet (the "AWC Objection Deadline Date"), either a notice indicating that the
Holder Agent accepts the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and the Draft Adjusted
Working Capital or a detailed statement describing its objections (if any) to
the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and the Draft Adjusted Working Capital (the
"AWC Objection Statement"). If the Holder Agent delivers to Buyer a notice
accepting the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and Draft Adjusted Working Capital,
or the Holder Agent does not deliver the AWC Objection Statement by the AWC
Objection Deadline Date, then, effective as of the earlier of the date of
delivery of such notice of acceptance or as of the close of business on the
AWC Objection Deadline Date, the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and the Draft
Adjusted Working Capital delivered by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 1.6(c)_
shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted
Working Capital. If the Holder Agent timely delivers the AWC Objection
Statement, such objections shall be resolved as follows:

(i) Buyer and the Holder Agent shall first use good faith efforts to resolve
such objections set forth in the AWC Objection Statement.

 

(ii) If Buyer and the Holder Agent do not reach a resolution of all objections
set forth in the AWC Objection Statement within thirty (30) days after
delivery of such AWC Objection Statement, then Buyer and the Holder Agent
shall, within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period or such later time as Buyer and the Holder Agent may mutually
agree, engage the Accountant, pursuant to an engagement agreement executed by
Buyer, the Holder Agent and the Accountant, to resolve any remaining
objections set forth in the AWC Objection Statement (the "AWC
Unresolved Objections").

 



\- 4 -  (iii) Buyer and the Holder Agent shall jointly submit to the
Accountant, within five (5) days after the date of the engagement of the
Accountant (as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a copy of
the Draft Closing Balance Sheet, the Draft Adjusted Working Capital, a copy of
the AWC Objection Statement, and a statement setting forth the resolution of
any objections agreed to by Buyer and the Holder Agent. Each of Buyer and the
Holder Agent shall submit to the Accountant (with a copy delivered to the
other Party on the same day), within thirty (30) days after the date of the
engagement of the Accountant, a memorandum (which may include supporting
exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the AWC Unresolved
Objections. Each of Buyer and the Holder Agent may (but shall not be required
to) submit to the Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other Party on the
same day), within forty five (45) days after the date of the engagement of the
Accountant, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to
the Accountant by the other Party. Unless requested by the Accountant in
writing, neither Buyer nor the Holder Agent may present any additional
information or arguments not previously set forth in such memorandum to the
Accountant, either orally or in writing.

(iv) Within sixty (60) days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the
Accountant shall determine whether the objections set forth in AWC Objection
Statement are valid and shall issue a ruling which shall include a
consolidated balance sheet, comprised of the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of Draft Adjusted Working Capital, in each case as adjusted
pursuant to any resolutions to objections agreed upon by Buyer and the Holder
Agent and pursuant to the Accountants resolution of the AWC Unresolved
Objections. Such adjusted Draft Closing Balance Sheet and such adjusted Draft
Adjusted Working Capital shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and Final Adjusted Working Capital.

(v) The resolution by the Accountant of the AWC Unresolved Objections shall be
conclusive and binding upon Buyer, the Company Holders and the Holder Agent.
Buyer, the Company, the Holder Agent and the Company Holders agree that the
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.6(c)_ for resolving disputes with
respect to the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and Draft Adjusted Working Capital
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes;
_provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit Buyer or the Holder Agent
from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of the Accountant.

 

(vi) The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne by Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Holder Agent on behalf of the Company Holders, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters set forth in
the AWC Unresolved Objections which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Accountant at the time the
determination of the Accountant is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

 

(d) If the Final Adjusted Working Capital as derived from the Final Closing
Balance Sheet is __less__ than the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital as
derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, then the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to such deficiency
(represented as a positive number) (such amount, the "Final AWC Deficiency")
and Buyer shall recover an amount in cash equal to such Final AWC Deficiency
from the Escrow Fund. In the event of a Final AWC Deficiency, Buyer and the
Holder Agent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within ten (10)
days following the date on which the Final

 



\- 5 -   Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_, a written notice executed by such
Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly disburse the amount of such
Final AWC Deficiency from the Escrow Fund to Buyer.

(e) If the Final Adjusted Working Capital as derived from the Final Closing
Balance Sheet __exceeds__ the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital as derived
from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, then the Merger Consideration shall
be increased by an amount equal to such excess (such amount, the "Final AWC
Excess") and Buyer shall deliver to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Company Holders in accordance with the applicable Conversion Ratio an amount
in cash equal to such Final AWC Excess, by wire transfer or other delivery of
immediately available funds, within ten (10) days after the date on which the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and Final Adjusted Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to  _Section 1.6(c)_.

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration unless the Company Stockholder holding such
Dissenting Shares shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal
under the Delaware General Corporation Law or properly withdrawn his, her or
its demand for appraisal. If such Company Stockholder has so forfeited or
withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, (i)
as of the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares and each such Dissenting Share shall
be converted into and represent the right to receive the Conversion Ratio
payable in respect of such Company Share pursuant to _Section 1.5_, and (ii)
promptly following the occurrence of such event, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall deliver to such Company Stockholder a payment representing
the amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5_,
subject to the provisions of _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.14_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other documents and instruments that relate to such demands
received by the Company and the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall give the Holder
Agent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Company
Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other documents and instruments
that relate to such demands received by the Surviving Corporation. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

from Governmental Entities, and to effect all registrations, filings and
notices with or to Governmental Entities, as may be required for such Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to otherwise

(b) The Company shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain, at its
expense, all such waivers, consents or approvals from third parties, and to

4.3 _Stockholder Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain, immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Requisite
Stockholder Approval and the stockholder approval set forth in _Section
5.2(p)_, pursuant to a written stockholder consent, all in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In

 



\- 36 -   connection with soliciting the written stockholder consent, promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
provide to its stockholders the Disclosure Statement, which shall include (A)
a summary of the Merger and this Agreement (which summary shall include a
summary of the terms relating to the indemnification obligations of the
Company Holders, the escrow arrangements and the authority of the Holder
Agent, and a statement that the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company shall constitute approval of such terms), (B) a statement that
appraisal or dissenters rights are available for the Company Shares pursuant
to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and a correct and
complete copy of such Section 262, and (C) a written notice pursuant to
Section 228 and Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to all
stockholders of the Company that did not execute such written consent
informing such stockholders that this Agreement and the Merger were adopted
and approved by the stockholders of the Company. Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Disclosure Statement.
The Company agrees not to distribute the Disclosure Statement until Buyer has
had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Disclosure Statement
and the Disclosure Statement has been approved by Buyer (which approval may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company, acting
through its Board of Directors, shall include in the Disclosure Statement the
unanimous recommendation of its Board of Directors that the stockholders of
the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger.

(b) Concurrently with the distribution of the Disclosure Statement, the
Company shall also submit to a stockholder vote the right, if any, of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to
receive any and all payments (or other benefits) that could reasonably be
characterized as "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b) of the Code, in a
manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "280G Disclosure Statement"). Consistent with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) and the Treasury Regulations, such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to the payment, benefit or other
compensation and the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to all
stockholders of all material facts concerning all payments that, but for such
vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual"
under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The vote set forth in this _Section 4.3(b)_ is referred to herein
as the "280G Vote". Prior to soliciting the 280G Vote and providing such
required disclosure, the Company shall submit to Buyer (i) for its reasonable
review and approval the 280G Disclosure Statement and (ii) for its reasonable
review all other documentation related to the 280G Vote.

 

(c) The Company shall ensure that the Disclosure Statement and the 280G
Disclosure Statement do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information concerning Buyer or Merger Sub furnished by
Buyer in writing for inclusion in the Disclosure Statement) and, in the case
of the 280G Disclosure Statement, all information necessary under Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder in order to validly obtain
the 280G Vote.

 



\- 37 -  (d) Buyer shall ensure that any information furnished by Buyer to the Company
in writing for inclusion in the Disclosure Statement or the 280G Disclosure
Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Company and the essential rights and obligations of the Company that have
arisen or will arise on or after the Closing Date for such Sponsored Employees
in connection with their Immigration Documents. Upon the Closing, the Company
and Buyer intend for Buyer to be deemed the Companys "successor-in-interest"
for the purpose of U.S. immigration Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
following the Closing, Buyers and the Companys obligations pursuant to this
_Section 4.12_ shall terminate with respect to any Sponsored Employee on the
date of such Sponsored Employees termination of employment with Buyer or any

expire at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the date that is eighteen (18) months

Power), _Section 2.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 2.3_ (Authorization of
Transaction), _Section 3.1_ (Organization and Corporate Power) and  _Section

following expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to the matters

of a representation or warranty, a Claim Notice, then the applicable
representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the
resolution of any claims arising from or related to the matter covered by
such notice. If the Legal Proceeding or claim with respect to which a Claim
Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Holder
Agent; and if the Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Claim Notice
to the Escrow Agent and funds have been retained in the Escrow Fund after the
Termination Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such
Claim Notice, the Holder Agent and the Indemnified Party shall promptly
deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such retained funds to the
Indemnifying Securityholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

6.2 _Indemnification by the Indemnifying Securityholders_. The Indemnifying
Securityholders shall, severally and not jointly (in proportion with their
respective Pro Rata Portion), indemnify Buyer in respect of, and hold it
harmless against, any and all Damages paid, incurred, sustained, or accrued by
any Indemnified Party resulting from, relating to or constituting:

 



\- 48 -  (a) any breach of, inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement, either when made as of the date of
this Agreement or immediately prior to the Effective Time as though made
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for representations and
warranties expressly made as of a specified date), or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by the Company to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach or nonperformance of or noncompliance with any covenant,
agreement or other obligation of the Company contained in or arising out of
this Agreement;

 

(c) any failure of any Company Stockholder to have good, valid and marketable
title to the issued and outstanding Company Shares issued in the name of such

(d) payments to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such payments, in

Buyer in connection with any litigation, arbitration, mediation or settlement
of such holders claims;

(e) any claims in connection with any of the matters set forth on _Schedule
5.2(s)_ ; or

Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company; or (iv) any claim that his, her or
its shares or other equity interests were wrongfully repurchased by the
Company or any Subsidiary.

Buyer and the Company acknowledge and agree that such Damages, if any, would
relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if
resolved prior to the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the
aggregate consideration to be paid to the Company Holders. The rights to
indemnification and compensation set forth in this _Article VI_ shall not be
affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this Agreement with
respect to the breach of, inaccuracy in, or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, certification, covenant, agreement or other
obligation within the scope of clauses (a) through (f) of this _Section
6.2_, or (ii) any waiver by Buyer or Merger Sub of any closing condition
relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the performance
of or compliance with agreements, covenants and other obligations, unless
such waiver is in a writing executed by Buyer and expressly waives the
specific breach of, inaccuracy in, nonperformance or noncompliance with such
representation, warranty, certification, covenant, agreement or other
obligation.

 



\- 49 -  6.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the Holder Agent
of the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall be
given within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice
of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for
such Third Party Action and the amount of the claimed Damages; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in
so notifying the Holder Agent shall relieve the Indemnifying Securityholders
of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any Damage or
Liability caused by or arising out of such failure. Within thirty (30) days
after delivery of such notification, the Holder Agent may, upon
written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the Holder Agent may only assume control of
such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that
any Damages, fines, costs or other Liabilities that may be assessed against
the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Action constitute
Damages for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this
_Article VI_, (B) the Third Party Action is asserted by a Person other than a
Governmental Entity and does not seek punitive, exemplary or similar damages,
treble damages or other damages in excess of actual damages, and does not
seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief or specific performance, (C)
the Person asserting a Third Party Action is not a customer or strategic
partner of any Indemnified Party, (D) the total amount of Damages that may be
awarded with respect to such claims does not exceed the amount then remaining
in the Escrow Fund after deducting therefrom the amount of all outstanding
unpaid and/or unresolved claims for indemnification and (E) the Third Party
Action does not involve Taxes, infringement, violation or misappropriation of
Intellectual Property, criminal Liability or the matters described in _Section
6.2(d)_ or  _Section 6.2(e)_. If the Holder Agent does not, or is not
permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a
Third Party Action, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-
controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The
Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised on a reasonably
current basis of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof
and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling
Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the
Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such
Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in
the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Action for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_
shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the
Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 6.3(a)_ or (ii) the Indemnifying Securityholders
assume control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes
that the Indemnifying Securityholders and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such
Third Party Action. Neither the Holder Agent or the Indemnifying
Securityholders shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any

 



\- 50 -   judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action in its sole discretion;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Agent shall be entitled to dispute
(x) that such Third Party Action constituted a claim for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VI and/or
(y) the amount of indemnifiable Damages subject to such Third Party Action.

 

(b) In order to seek indemnification under this _Article VI_ , an Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Holder Agent. If the Indemnified
Party is Buyer, the Holder Agent shall deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to
the Escrow Agent.

(c) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Holder Agent
shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the Holder Agent
shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the
Claimed Amount (in which case, subject to Section 6.4(c), , the Holder Agent
and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3)
days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by the
Holder Agent and the Indemnified Party instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Claimed Amount to Buyer), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case, subject to Section
6.4(c), , the Holder Agent and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within three (3) days following the delivery of the Response, a
written notice executed by the Holder Agent and the Indemnified Party
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Amount to Buyer) or (iii)
dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount.

 

(d) During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a Response
that reflects a Dispute, the Holder Agent and the Indemnified Party shall use
good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute.

6.4 _Limitations_. 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, (i) the aggregate Liability of the
Indemnifying Securityholders for Damages under this _Article VI_ shall not
exceed the Escrow Fund and (ii) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_ unless and until all Damages
hereunder exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Threshold
Amount") whereupon the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified
only for such Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ (A) that
the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.4_ shall not apply to any claim
pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ relating to a breach of, inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.1_
(Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), _Section 2.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 2.3_ (Authorization of Transaction), _Section
2.21(d)_ (Employees), _Section 2.29_ (Brokers Fees) claims pursuant to 
_Section 6.2(c)_, _Section 6.2(d)_, _Section 6.2(e)_, _Section 6.2(f)_ and
claims for intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or fraud
(collectively, the "Excepted Matters"). 

(b) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Damages pursuant to this
_Article VI_ (but not for purposes of determining whether a breach or
inaccuracy has occurred), all representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in _Article II_ shall be construed as if the terms "material" or
"in all material respects" and any reference to "Company Material Adverse
Effect" (and variations thereof) were omitted.

 



\- 51 -  (c) Any payments required to be made to an Indemnified Party pursuant
to claims for indemnification hereunder with respect to Excepted Matters
shall be made first by resort to the Escrow Fund, and second, if the balance
of the Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy the entire amount of payments to
be made to an Indemnified Party in respect of such Excepted Matters, by
seeking recourse to each Indemnifying Securityholder, severally and not
jointly in accordance with each such Indemnifying Securityholders Pro Rata
Portion.

 

(d) All Damages recovered by the Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund
shall be allocated among the Indemnifying Securityholders in accordance with
their Pro Rata Portion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except for claims for intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or
fraud, no Indemnifying Securityholder shall be liable for more than the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be paid to such Indemnifying
Securityholder (assuming the full amount of Merger Consideration (including
all amounts held in the Escrow Fund) is actually paid to such Indemnifying
Securityholder) pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the aggregate Liability
of Buyer for Damages hereunder shall not exceed the Merger Consideration.

(f) Except with respect to claims for intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or fraud, after the Closing, the rights of the Indemnified Parties
under this _Article VI_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to claims resulting from or
relating to any breach of, inaccuracy in, nonperformance or noncompliance with
such representation, warranty, certification, covenant, agreement or other
obligation contained in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ nothing
herein shall be construed to limit the remedies available to, or the amount of
Damages recoverable by, Buyer for breach of any of the Ancillary Agreements by
any of the parties thereto other than the Company.

 

(g) The amount of any Damages payable by the Indemnifying Securityholders
pursuant to this _Article VI_ shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Damages (net of any insurance premium increases or other costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party in respect of such insurance proceeds); provided that
nothing set forth in this _Section 6.4(g)_ shall require the Indemnified
Party to make an insurance claim with respect to such Damages.

(h) No Indemnifying Securityholder shall have any right of contribution
against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by
the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements.

(i) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified for special,
punitive or exemplary Damages (collectively, "Special Damages") unless such
Indemnified Party is required to pay Special Damages to a third party in which
case such Special Damages shall constitute Damages for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI. No party
hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with respect to (i)
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party at the Closing or (ii) any
Damages if such Damages were included in the calculation of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5_ or in the 

 



\- 52 -   calculation of the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital or the Final Adjusted
Working Capital pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (in each case, to the extent so
included).

 

6.5 _Liability and Authority of Holder Agent; Successors and Assignees_.

 

(a) _Limitation on Liability_. The Holder Agent shall incur no Liability to
the Company Holders with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in
reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
documents believed by it to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for other
action or inaction except its own bad faith, willful misconduct or gross
negligence and the Company Holders shall severally and not jointly (in
proportion with their respective Pro Rata Portion), indemnify the Holder Agent
from any liabilities or obligations arising out of its serving as the
Holder Agent hereunder, except to the extent arising out of the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Holder Agent,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel. The Holder Agent
may, in all questions arising under the Escrow Agreement, rely on the advice
of counsel and the Holder Agent shall not be liable to the Company Holders for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Holder Agent based on
such advice.

 

(b) _Successor Holder Agent_. In the event of the death or permanent
disability of any Holder Agent, or his or her resignation as a Holder Agent,
a successor Holder Agent shall be elected by a majority vote of the Company
Holders, with each such Company Holder (or his, her or its successors or
assigns) to be given a vote equal to the number of votes represented by the
Company Shares held by such Company Holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Each successor Holder Agent shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Holder
Agent, and the term "Holder Agent" as used herein shall be deemed to include
successor Holder Agent.

(c) _Power and Authority_. The Holder Agent shall have full power and
authority to represent the Company Holders, and their successors, with respect
to all matters arising under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and all
actions taken by any Holder Agent hereunder shall be binding upon the Company
Holders, and their successors, as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by each of them. __ All such actions shall be deemed to be facts
ascertainable outside this Agreement and shall be binding on all Company
Holders and holders of Unvested Options as a matter of contract Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Agent shall have full
power and authority to interpret all of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, to compromise any claims asserted hereunder and to authorize
payments to be made with respect thereto, on behalf of the Company Holders and
holders of Unvested Options and their successors.

hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited
courier, messenger service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but

delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.8 _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation its interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement)
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those
of the State of Delaware.

 



\- 71 -  9.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. Buyer and the Company may mutually amend any
provision of this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) any amendment effected subsequent to the Requisite
Stockholder Approval shall be subject to any restrictions contained in the
Delaware General Corporation Law and (ii) any amendment to _Section 6.5_

signed by (A) if prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company and (B) if
following the Closing, the Buyer and the Holder Agent. No waiver of any right
or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect
to any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder
shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in

and no amendment, supplement or update made or delivered (or purporting to be
made or delivered) after the date of this Agreement without such consent shall
have any effect on any of the rights or obligations of the Company or Buyer,
respectively.

9.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination
of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified.

 

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or only if the Court of
Chancery declined to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal

the enforcement of any arbitral award made in connection with any arbitration
of a Dispute hereunder), (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) waives any
claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court, (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any other court and (e) waives any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each Party agrees to accept service of any
summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided for
the giving of notices in _Section 9.7_, provided that nothing in this
_Section 9.11_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve such summons,
complaint or other initial pleading in any other manner permitted by Law.
