C.B. 321 (the "Integrated Transaction");   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and, subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, the Merger.   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and as a condition and an inducement to Parent\'s and

will irrevocably agree to), among other things, vote his shares of Company
Common Stock (as defined herein) in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and as a condition and an inducement to Parent\'s and Merger
Sub\'s entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth

Amendment");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and as a condition and an inducement to Parent\'s and Merger

and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and an inducement to the
Company\'s entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set
forth herein, Parent and the Company are entering into a Registration Rights
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Registration Rights
Agreement");   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Integrated Transaction shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this
Agreement and the LLC Sub Merger Agreement will together be, and hereby are,
adopted as a plan of reorganization; and   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein contained, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:   ARTICLE
I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger; Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). On the Closing
Date (defined below), immediately after the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing"), a certificate of merger, prepared and executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"), shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the "Effective Time").   1.2 Closing. The Closing shall take place on the
date on which the Stockholder Approval is obtained if all of the conditions
set forth in Article VI are satisfied (or waived in accordance with this
Agreement) as of such date (other than any such conditions which by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to
be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived on the
Closing Date) at 9:30 a.m., Dallas, Texas time (or, if the Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained as of 9:30 a.m. on such date,   
2    promptly upon obtaining the Stockholder Approval) or, if there are
conditions set forth in Article VI that are not satisfied as of the date on
which the Stockholder Approval is obtained (other than any such conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date), then the
Closing shall take place at 9:30 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on a date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this Agreement) of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any
such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by applicable law) waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Vinson and
Elkins L.L.P., 2001 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75201, unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties (such date on which the Closing
occurs, the "Closing Date"); provided, that if a Stock Consideration
Shortfall exists on the date on which the Stockholder Approval is obtained,
at the option of the Company, the Closing may be delayed up to five business
days after the date the Stockholder Approval is obtained, during which time
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit, or cause to
be solicited, revised elections from holders that would eliminate the Stock
Consideration Shortfall.   1.3 Effects of the Merger.   (a) At the
Effective Time: (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the Company (or, as applicable, its successors
and assigns and their respective successors and assigns) is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"); (ii) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended in the Merger to delete the text set forth in Article
Nine therein and replace it with a provision that specifically permits
stockholders to effect by written consent any action required or permitted to
be taken by the stockholders at a stockholders\' meeting and, as so amended,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
duly amended or repealed; and (iii) the Bylaws of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed.   (b) The directors
of Merger Sub shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, and such directors shall serve until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
death, resignation or removal in accordance with Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The officers of Merger Sub shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, and such officers shall serve until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.   (c) The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Section 1.3 and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.   1.4 Post-Closing Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to merge with and into LLC Sub,
with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving entity in such merger as a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, substantially    3    in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement attached hereto as Exhibit F. There
shall be no condition to the completion of the LLC Sub Merger other than the
completion of the Merger. From and after such merger, LLC Sub shall be the
Surviving Corporation for purposes of this Agreement. When the LLC Sub Merger
occurs, Parent shall own all the membership interests and other equity in LLC
Sub, and LLC Sub shall be disregarded for United States federal income
tax purposes.   ARTICLE II  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK  OF
THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   2.1 Effect of Merger
on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of
any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
("Company Common Stock") or capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Conversion of
Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of the capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of Company Common
Stock.   (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section
2.1(f), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares held by any Subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and excluding Appraisal Shares
(as defined below), but including shares of Company Restricted Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time) (the "Company
Closing Shares") shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into
and exchanged for the right to receive from Parent, subject to causes (w),
(x), (y) and (z) of this Section 2.1(b) below, to the extent applicable:  
(i) subject to elections by holders of Company Closing Shares to receive
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(ii) and
Section 2.1(b)(iii), an amount in cash (the "Per Share Cash Value") equal to
the product obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the Average Closing
Price; or   (ii) upon the valid election of a holder of Company
Closing Shares to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance herewith:   (A)
0.909 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock") if the Average Closing Price (as defined below) is
less than $22.00 per share, or   (B) that fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded to the third nearest decimal place) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing $20.00 by the Average Closing Price, if the
Average Closing Price is greater than or equal to $22.00 per share and less
than or equal to $24.53 per share, or    4     (C) 0.815 of a share of
Parent Common Stock if the Average Closing Price is greater than or equal to
$24.54 per share and less than or equal to $30.67 per share, or   (D) that
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the third nearest
decimal place) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $25.00 by the
Average Closing Price, if the Average Closing Price is greater than or equal
$30.68 and less than or equal to $33.21, or   (E) 0.753 of a share of Parent
Common Stock if the Average Closing Price is greater than $33.21 (such
applicable fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, as it may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the "Exchange Ratio"); or   (iii) upon the
valid election of a holder of Company Closing Shares in accordance herewith
to receive cash and Parent Common Stock, (A) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (1) 0.50 multiplied (2) by the Per Share Cash Value and (B) a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (1) 0.50
multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio.  The consideration described in clause
(i) above of this Section 2.1(b) is referred to herein as the "Cash
Consideration," the consideration described in clause (ii) above of this
Section 2.1(b) is referred to herein as the "Stock Consideration," the
consideration described in clause (iii) above of this Section 2.1(b) is
referred to herein as the "Mixed Consideration," and the Stock Consideration,
the Cash Consideration, the Mixed Consideration and the cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6 is collectively referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration."  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.1(b):   (w) in order to receive Stock
Consideration or Mixed Consideration, a holder of Company Closing Shares must
be an Eligible Holder and must make a valid Election pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 2.1(e) (holders that make a valid Election to receive
Mixed Consideration being referred to herein as the "Mixed Consideration
Holders," and holders that make a valid Election to receive Stock
Consideration being separately referred to herein as "Stock Consideration
Holders");   (x) subject to the following clause (y), all holders of
Company Closing Shares that are not Mixed Consideration Holders or Stock
Consideration Holders, including as a result of the failure to return
properly completed and executed Eligible Holder Election Materials prior to
the Election Deadline, will receive Cash Consideration in exchange for their
shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger (such holders being referred to
herein as the "Cash Consideration Holders");   (y) notwithstanding the
foregoing clause (x), if there is a Stock Consideration Shortfall, then each
Company Closing Share held by a Cash Consideration Holder that (1) holds, in
the aggregate, more than 1% of the Company Closing Shares, (2) held such
shares as of the record date for the Stockholders\' Meeting and continuously
held such shares from such record date to the Effective Time, and (3)
properly completed and returned an Investor Questionnaire and Election Form
certifying that it was an "accredited investor" and satisfies the   
5    investor suitability standards set forth therein at any time after
the delivery to the Exchange Agent of such holder\'s Investor Questionnaire
and Election Form or, if no Investor Questionnaire and Election Form is
delivered, at the discretion of Parent, after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval (provided Parent shall have no obligation to accept any Investor
Questionnaire and Election Form from any such holder after receipt of the
Stockholder Approval and may elect to accept such Investor Questionnaire and
Election Form after receipt of the Stockholder Approval from one or more Cash
Consideration Holders without any obligation to accept such Investor
Questionnaire and Election Form from other Cash Consideration Holders) (an
"Accredited Cash Elector") shall, notwithstanding the Accredited Cash
Elector\'s election to receive the Cash Consideration, be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive from Parent the Adjusted Per Share Stock
Amount and the Adjusted Per Share Cash Amount; provided further that:   (A)
if the number of shares of Parent Common Stock allocated to Cash
Consideration Holders pursuant to this clause (y) (but not taking
into account this subclause (A) or subclause (B) of this clause (y)) is not
otherwise sufficient to eliminate the Stock Consideration Shortfall, and
removing the requirement that an Accredited Cash Elector hold, in the
aggregate, more than 1% of the Company Closing Shares would cause a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be allocated to Cash
Consideration Holders to eliminate the Stock Consideration Shortfall (either
by itself or together with the further adjustment contemplated by subclause
(B) below of this clause (y)), then the requirement in subclause (1) of this
clause (y) shall not apply in order for a Cash Consideration Holder to be
deemed an Accredited Cash Elector;   (B) if the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock allocated to Cash Consideration Holders pursuant to this clause
(y) (taking into account subclause (A) above of this clause (y) but not
taking into account this subclause (B)) is not otherwise sufficient to
eliminate the Stock Consideration Shortfall, then the number of additional
shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to be issued as Merger Consideration
in order to eliminate the Stock Consideration Shortfall shall be allocated on
a pro-rata basis to every Company Closing Share held by an Accredited Cash
Elector (taking into account subclause (A) of this clause (y)) and Mixed
Consideration Holder (in the case of Accredited Cash Electors, such number
shall be in addition to the Adjusted Per Share Stock Amount and, in the case
of Mixed Consideration Holders, such number shall be in addition to the
Parent Common Stock component of such Mixed Consideration, provided that in
no event shall a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock in excess of the
Exchange Ratio be issued in exchange for each Company Closing Share in the
Merger), and the amount of cash to be issued in exchange for any such Company
Closing Share shall be an amount equal to the difference of (1) the Per Share
Cash Value, minus (2) the product of the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in exchange for such Company Closing Share pursuant to
this clause (y) multiplied by the Average Closing Price; and   (C)
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (y), if the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be allocated to Accredited
Cash Electors and Mixed Consideration Holders pursuant to this clause (y),
taking into account subclauses (A) and (B) above of this clause (y), is not
sufficient to eliminate the Stock Consideration Shortfall (which, for
purposes of this subclause (C), shall be calculated on the basis that the
Required Stock Consideration Amount equals the Stock Consideration
Tax Amount), then none of the provisions of this clause (y) shall
apply.    6     (z) in the event that the Exchange Ratio exceeds 0.815,
and the Elected Stock Consideration Amount represents more than 90% of the
Total Merger Consideration Value, then, if Parent so elects, in its sole
discretion, each Company Closing Share held by a Stock Consideration Holder
shall, notwithstanding such Stock Consideration Holder\'s election to receive
Stock Consideration, be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
from Parent the Parent Optional Cash Payout Amount and the Parent Optional
Stock Amount.   As used herein, the following terms have the meanings given

product of (1) 0.50 multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio.   "Average
Closing Price" means the average (rounded to the nearest second decimal
place) of the daily closing prices for the shares of Parent Common Stock for
the fifteen consecutive full trading days on which such shares are

without giving affect to Section 2.1(b)(z)), and in respect of   
7    Appraisal Shares (assuming for purposes of this definition that each
Appraisal Share is converted into an amount in cash equal to the Per Share
Cash Value), divided by (B) the number of Company Closing Shares that are
held by Stock Consideration Holders; provided that, if the sum of (1) the
Parent Optional Cash Payout Amount and (2) the product of the Parent Optional
Stock Amount multiplied by the Average Closing Price, does not equal the Per
Share Cash Value, then the Parent Optional Cash Payout Amount shall be
adjusted such that the sum of (1) the Parent Optional Cash Payout Amount and
(2) the product of the Parent Optional Stock Amount multiplied by the Average
Closing Price shall equal the Per Share Cash Value.   "Parent Optional
Stock Amount" means a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the

Section 1.368-1(e), as reasonably determined in good faith by the Company by
the Closing, with such determination being subject to the approval of Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.   "Total Merger Consideration
Value" means an amount in dollars equal to the product of (A) the sum of (1)
the total number of Company Closing Shares plus (2) the total number of
Appraisal Shares, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Cash Value.   (c) Excess

prior to the Effective Time, there shall be outstanding any capital stock of
the Company other than a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to or

Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the Adjusted Per Share Cash
Value, divided by (2) the Average Closing Price. "Adjusted Per Share Cash
Value" means the quotient of (x) the Total Merger Consideration
Value (calculated for these purposes as if the number of shares of Company
Closing Shares equals the sum of the amounts in subclauses (A) and (B) of
this clause (i), and without taking into account any adjustment to the
Exchange Ratio required by this clause (i) or clauses (ii) or (iii) of this
clause (c)), divided by (y) the total number of Company Closing Shares.

shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance under options, awards or
other instruments that were not outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
and set forth on Schedule 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Excess Options"), then, at the option of Parent, in its sole discretion, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal that fraction (rounded to
the nearest third decimal place) of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to
the quotient of (A) the Excess Option Payout Share Amount, divided by (B) the
total number of Company Closing Shares. "Excess Option Payout Share Amount"
means an amount (rounded to the nearest second decimal place) equal to the
quotient of (1) the difference of (x) the Total Merger Consideration Value
(with the calculation of such amount to take into account any adjustment to
the Exchange Ratio required by clause (i) of this clause (c) but not any

of this clause (c)), minus (y) the Excess Option Payout, divided by (2) the
Average Closing Price. "Excess Option Payout" means an amount equal to the
difference of (1) the product of (x) the total number of Excess Options,
multiplied by (y) Per Share Cash Value, minus (2) the aggregate exercise
price for all of the Excess Options.   (iii) In the event that the Company
incurs out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500,000 between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time in connection with, relating to, or as a
result of, any Acquisition Proposal (such excess amount, the "Excess Expense
Amount"), then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal that fraction
(rounded to the nearest third decimal place) of a share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the Expense Adjusted Share Amount, divided
by (B) the total number of Company Closing Shares. "Expense Adjusted Share

this Section 2.1(c) but not any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio required by
this clause (iii)) minus (B) the Excess Expense Amount, divided by (B) the
Average Closing Price.   (d) Proxy Materials. The Company shall mail with
the Proxy Statement to each person who is a holder of record of Company
Common Stock on the record date for the Stockholders\' Meeting:   (i) a
proxy card pursuant to which holders of Company Common Stock shall indicate
whether they authorize the proxies designated therein to vote in favor of the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement at the Stockholders\' Meeting (a
"Proxy Card"),    9     (ii) with respect to holders of Company Common
Stock whom Parent has determined in good faith may be offered and sold Parent
Common Stock in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
an exemption from registration under the U.S. federal securities laws
pursuant to Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and applicable state securities laws or, in
the case of non-U.S. holders of Company Common Stock, pursuant to regulations
promulgated under the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of
foreign jurisdictions ("Eligible Holders"):   (A) an investor questionnaire
and election form substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G
(with such modifications thereto as are reasonably agreed upon by Parent and
the Company) pursuant to which each Eligible Holder shall be able to elect to
receive Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration or Mixed Consideration (an
"Election"), and regardless of the type of Merger Consideration chosen, shall
make certain representations regarding investor suitability and related
matters set forth therein (an "Investor Questionnaire and Election
Form"),   (B) appropriate transmittal materials and instructions for the
surrender of Certificates and the transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in
each case to be effective as of the Effective Time (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or irrevocable instructions to transfer
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent),   (C) a selling
securityholder questionnaire to be used in compiling information for the
registration statement to be filed by Parent pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement,   (D) a joinder to the Registration Rights Agreement
pursuant to which such holder agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
of the Registration Rights Agreement,   (E) a certificate of nonforeign
status meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)
(a "FIRPTA Affidavit") and   (F) an IRS Form W-9 (in the case of a U.S.
person) or appropriate IRS Form W-8 (in the case of a non-U.S. person), or
applicable substitute thereof, or instructions regarding where to obtain such
forms (the materials described in clauses (i) and (ii)(A) through (ii)(F)
collectively, the "Eligible Holder Election Materials"), and   (iii) with
respect to holders of Company Common Stock that are not Eligible Holders:  
(A) appropriate transmittal materials and instructions for the surrender of
Certificates and the transfer of Uncertificated Shares (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or irrevocable instructions to
transfer the Eligible Holders Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent),   (B) a FIRPTA Affidavit,    10     (C) an IRS Form W-9 (in
the case of a U.S. person) or appropriate IRS Form W-8 (in the case of a
non-U.S. person), or applicable substitute thereof, or instructions regarding
where to obtain such forms (the materials described in clauses (i) and
(iii)(A) through (iii)(C) collectively, the "Non-Eligible Holder Election
Materials," and together with the Eligible Holder Election Materials, the
"Election Materials").   (e) Elections. For a record holder of Company
Closing Shares to effect a valid Election to receive the Mixed Consideration
or the Stock Consideration, such holder must:   (i) be an Eligible
Holder,   (ii) have held such shares as of the record date for
the Stockholders\' Meeting,   (iii) have held such shares continuously from
the record date to the Effective Time, and   (iv) have properly completed,
signed and delivered to the Exchange Agent by the close of business on the
last business day prior to the date on which the Stockholders\' Meeting is
held (the "Election Deadline") the Eligible Holder Election Materials with an
election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration, as
applicable, in the Investor Questionnaire and Election Form.   Parent will
have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the
Exchange Agent, to determine whether Election Materials have been properly
completed, signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects
in Election Materials. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange Agent) in
such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange
Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in
Election Materials submitted to the Exchange Agent. If an Eligible Holder\'s
Eligible Holder Election Materials are not properly completed, signed and
timely submitted and such defect is not waived by Parent, then a purported
Election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration therein shall
be deemed to be of no force and effect and an Election to receive Cash
Consideration shall be deemed to have been made with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such defective Eligible Holder Election
Materials; provided, however, that, if Parent determines in its sole
discretion (either prior to or after the Election Deadline) to contact any
Eligible Holder that submitted defective Eligible Holder Election Materials
(such that a purported Election therein to receive Stock Consideration or
Mixed Consideration is invalid) in order cause such defective Eligible Holder
Election Materials to be corrected, then the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in contacting any such holder and, if any such defective Eligible
Holder Election Materials are cured to the satisfaction of Parent in its sole
discretion, then such Eligible Holder shall be deemed to have made a valid
Election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration, as
applicable; and provided further that, if Parent determines in its sole
discretion (either prior to or after the Election Deadline) to contact any
Eligible Holder that submitted an Election to receive Cash
Consideration, then the Company shall cooperate with Parent in contacting any
such holder and, if any such holder replaces its previous Election with an
Election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration, then such
Eligible Holder shall be deemed to have made a valid Election to receive
Stock    11    Consideration or Mixed Consideration, as applicable.
Each holder shall make the same Election with respect to all of such
holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock. All Certificates so surrendered and
all Uncertificated Shares subject to irrevocable instructions to transfer
shall be subject to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.7. The
Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by this Section
2.1 and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders
of Company Common Stock absent manifest error. In the case of shares that are
certificated, the Exchange Agent shall not accept guarantee of delivery of
Certificates in lieu of physical delivery of Certificates. An Election may
not be revoked, provided that Parent, in its sole discretion, may permit (i)
an Election by an Eligible Holder to receive Cash Consideration to be revoked
in exchange for an election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed
Consideration and (ii) an Election by an Eligible Holder to receive Mixed
Consideration to be revoked in exchange for an Election to receive Stock
Consideration. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the
provisions hereof and any Certificates have been transmitted to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to the provisions hereof, such Certificates shall be promptly
returned without charge to the person submitting same and any irrevocable
instructions to transfer, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, shall be
deemed null and void.   (f) Rounding Principles.   (i) To the extent any
calculation provided for in this Section 2.1 results in fractional numbers,
then except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 2.1 and in
Section 2.1(f)(ii), (A) all fractional dollar or cash amounts shall be
rounded to the nearest three decimal places and (B) all fractional share
amounts shall be rounded to the nearest four decimal places.   (ii) To
determine the amount of cash or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that a holder of Company Closing Shares is entitled to receive with respect
to such holder\'s Company Closing Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the
following rounding principles shall apply:   (A) the amount of cash each
holder of Company Closing Shares shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(i) shall be determined by aggregating the Per Share Cash Value
for all Company Closing Shares held by such holder and rounding such
aggregate amount to the nearest second decimal place;   (B) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock each holder of Company Closing Shares shall be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii) shall be determined by
aggregating the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock for all Company
Closing Shares held by such holder and rounding such aggregate amount to the
nearest third decimal place;   (C) the amount of cash each holder of Company
Closing Shares shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii)
shall be determined by aggregating the cash amount determined pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(iii)(A) for all Company Closing Shares held by such holder and
rounding such aggregate amount to the nearest second decimal place, and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock such holder of Company Closing Shares
shall be    12    entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(iii)(B) shall be determined by aggregating the fractional amount
determined pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) for all Company Closing Shares
held by such holder and rounding such aggregate amount to the nearest third
decimal place; and   (D) the amount of cash each Accredited Cash Elector or
Mixed Consideration Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to clause (y) of
Section 2.1(b) shall be determined by aggregating the cash amount to be
issued for all Company Closing Shares held by such Accredited Cash Elector or
Mixed Consideration Holder and rounding such aggregate amount to the nearest
second decimal place and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by each Accredited Cash Elector or Mixed Consideration Holder
pursuant to clause (y) shall be determined by aggregating the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received for all Company Closing Shares held by
such Accredited Cash Elector or Mixed Consideration Holder and rounding such
aggregate amount to the nearest third decimal place.   2.2 Anti-Dilution
Provisions.   (a) In the event that Parent changes the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend, or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock and if the record date therefor
(in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case
of a stock split, stock combination or similar recapitalization for which a
record date is not established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.   (b) In the event that,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall consummate a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or other reorganization, or any other transaction with another
person or entity pursuant to which the holders of Parent Common Stock receive
or become entitled to receive securities, cash or other assets or any
combination thereof, each holder of Company Closing Shares subject to a valid
Election to receive Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration shall be
entitled to receive at the Effective Time for each Company Closing Share that
would otherwise be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
Parent Common Stock, the amount of securities, cash or other assets that such
holder would have received or become entitled to receive had such holder been
the record holder of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 had the Effective
Time occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction.  
2.3 Shares Held by Parent, the Company or Subsidiaries. Each of the shares of
Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled and retired at
the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.   2.4 Appraisal Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who has not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the    13    Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(b), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares (the "Appraisal Shares") in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and each of such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Cash Consideration with respect to such shares (without
regard to Section 2.1(b)(y)). The Company shall deliver prompt notice to
Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
any withdrawal of such a demand for appraisal and any other
instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 262, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.   2.5 Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock.
Each outstanding Company Option and share of Company Restricted Stock shall
be treated as provided in Section 5.6.   2.6 Fractional Shares.   (a) No
Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, no dividend or distribution of
Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent.   (b) In lieu of such fractional share
interests, Parent shall either (i) pay to each former holder of Company
Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by
such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Average Closing Price or
(ii) instruct the Exchange Agent to follow the procedures set forth in
Section 2.6(c).   (c) If Parent shall have instructed the Exchange Agent to
follow the procedures in this Section 2.6(c):   (i) The Exchange Agent
shall determine the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that would be distributed to holders of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 2.1 if no effect were given to
Section 2.6(a) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to Section 2.1, taking into account the effect of Section
2.6(a) (such excess, the "Excess Shares").    14     (ii) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell the
Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE, in the manner set forth
below.   (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of
the Excess Shares. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares
(or paid to Parent pursuant to Section 2.7(f)), the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares (the "Common Stock Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each holder of a
Certificate or an Uncertificated Share shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common
Stock Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest in the Parent Common Stock to which such holder of
a Certificate or an Uncertificated Share is entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in the Parent
Common Stock to which all holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares are entitled. Parent shall comply with the provisions of Rule 236(c)
under the Securities Act.   (iv) As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares in lieu of any fractional share
interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to such holders of Certificates that have surrendered their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 2.7.   2.7 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with Parent\'s transfer agent or such other bank
or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (provided that the Company agrees that Parent\'s transfer agent,
Computershare Shareholder Services, Inc., is acceptable to the Company) (the
"Exchange Agent") the Merger Consideration to be issued and paid in respect
of certificates representing Company Closing Shares (the "Certificates") and
uncertificated Company Closing Shares ("Uncertificated Shares") (the
"Exchange Fund"); provided that in the event the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or the amount of cash to be delivered to a holder of Company
Closing Shares as of the Effective Time shall be adjusted after the Effective
Time pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, then such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash, as applicable, shall be
delivered to the Exchange Agent promptly upon the determination of any such
adjustment. From time to time as necessary, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares as contemplated
by Section 2.6 and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of
Company Closing Shares are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than five business
days thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each Cash Consideration Holder that did not
previously submit the appropriate Election Materials to the Exchange Agent:
(i) appropriate    15    transmittal materials and instructions for the
surrender of Certificates (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), (ii) a FIRPTA Affidavit, and (iii)
an IRS Form W-9 (in the case of a U.S. person) or appropriate IRS Form W-8
(in the case of a non-U.S. person), or applicable substitute thereof, or
instructions regarding where to obtain such forms (unless the Exchange Agent
already possesses such materials with respect to such holder); provided that,
in the sole discretion of Parent, in the case of a Cash Consideration Holder
that is an Eligible Holder that did not previously submit Eligible Holder
Election Materials to the Exchange Agent, Parent may cause such holders to
receive the Eligible Holder Election Materials and may permit such holders to
elect to receive either Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration if such
Eligible Holder Election Materials are completed, executed and submitted
to the Exchange Agent with an Election to receive Stock Consideration or
Mixed Consideration within 30 days after the Effective Time. The Certificate
or Certificates so delivered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent
may reasonably require. The Exchange Agent shall not accept guarantee of
delivery of Certificates in lieu of physical delivery of Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt
of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to
be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity
as Parent and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, (iii) such
processing fee as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require and (iv) any
other documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange
thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the consideration into
which the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed
Certificate shall have been converted. The Exchange Agent may establish such
other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its
duties as it may deem appropriate. For purposes of this Agreement, "business
day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or other day on which
banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in New York, New York or
Dallas, Texas.   (b) Each holder of Company Closing Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled promptly to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt by the Exchange Agent of a shipment control list from the
Depository Trust Company (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Closing Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, together
with all undelivered dividends or distributions in respect of such shares
(without interest) pursuant to Section 2.7(d). The shares of Parent Common
Stock issued as Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless such Parent Common Stock is issued in exchange for Certificates,
in which case the holder will receive Parent Common Stock in certificated
form unless such holder elects to receive book-entry shares.   (c) Each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
and will deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Closing Shares such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law, including any required withholding of excise taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts shall    16    be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Closing
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and,
with respect to any such withholdings that are compensation, shall not be
treated as a dividend.   (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed as to holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Company Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered or transferred for exchange in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.7(a), each Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing Company Closing Shares shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been
declared or made by the Company in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared
by Parent on the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or
after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions on all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
this Agreement, but after the Effective Time no dividend or other
distribution payable to the holders of record of Parent Common Stock as of
any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of
any Certificate or Uncertificated Share until such holder surrenders
such Certificate or transfers such Uncertificated Share for exchange as
provided in Section 2.7(a). If any portion of the Cash Consideration is to be
paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. No Mixed Consideration or Stock Consideration shall be paid to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered as of the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented or Uncertificated Shares
are transferred to the Surviving Corporation for any reason other than to
perfect statutory appraisal rights, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.7. Shares of Parent Common Stock held in the
Exchange Fund, until their issuance in the Merger upon surrender
of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares or until such shares
are delivered to a public official or Parent as contemplated by Section
2.7(f), shall be deemed issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock.
In connection with any meeting of stockholders of Parent, the Exchange Agent
shall be directed to cause such shares to be present and counted for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum, and the Exchange Agent shall be
directed to cause such shares to be voted for, voted against, abstained and
not voted in the same proportion as the shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding and not held in the Exchange Fund. From and after such time as
any shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Exchange Fund are returned to
the Company as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 2.7(f), such
shares shall be deemed to be held in treasury and shall not be considered
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock.    17     (e)
Any portion of the Exchange Fund and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock made available to the Exchange Agent that remain
undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received
the Merger Consideration and cash and other dividends or distributions to
which they are entitled under this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock.   (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for such
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares at such date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any governmental entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.   2.8 Expiration of
Company Rights. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the rights to
purchase Company Common Stock in accordance with the Company Rights Agreement
(each, a "Company Right") shall expire as provided in the Rights Agreement
Amendment.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1

Form S-1 filed by the Company with the SEC on April 6, 2006 (Registration No.
333-129504), or as qualified by matters reflected on the disclosure schedule
dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent
on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule")

representation and warranty to the extent specified therein and such other
representations and warranties contained herein (regardless of whether or not
such representation or warranty contains a reference to such disclosure
schedule) to the extent a matter in such disclosure schedule is disclosed in
such a way as to make its relevance to the information called for by such
other representation or warranty readily apparent on its face)):   (a)
Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries

partnership duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good

and (iii) is duly qualified and licensed, as may be required, and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification and licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions    18    where the failure so to be qualified and
licensed could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein). The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, and
correct and complete copies of its Subsidiaries\' organizational documents,

changes, violations, events or effects (whether or not such result,

its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) would materially impair the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, (y) would
materially impair the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to own,
hold, develop or operate their assets and properties, or (z) would prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall any change in conditions affecting
the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect (except for any changes referred to in this
proviso which, individually or in the aggregate, disproportionately affect
the financial condition, properties, business or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as compared to other industry
participants); and (ii) "Subsidiary" means, with respect to the Company or

favorable determination letter from the IRS that has not been revoked or is a

or for the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the Company Employee
Benefits Plans have been timely reported, fully paid and discharged. There
are no material unpaid fees, penalties, interest or assessments due from the

any Company Employee Welfare Benefit Plan\'s welfare benefit fund (as such

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any
prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA, as a fiduciary or party in interest with respect to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in
any material liability, and, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (A) no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan and (B) no fiduciary has any liability for
breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection
with the administration or investment of assets of any Company Employee
Benefit Plan.   (viii) Neither the Company nor any entity that is or has
been a Company ERISA Affiliate within the six years preceding the date of
this Agreement has, within the six year period preceding the date of this
Agreement sponsored, maintained, or contributed to any employee benefit plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA. No Company Employee Welfare Benefit Plan is a
multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA.   (ix) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not offered to
provide life, health or medical benefits or insurance coverage to any
individual, or to the family members of any individual, for any period
extending beyond the termination of the individual\'s employment, except to
the extent required by the COBRA provisions in ERISA and the Code or similar
provisions of state law.   (x) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in connection with

Subsidiaries to severance pay, any change in control payment or any other
material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, change the form or method of

independent contractor, director or officer, or (C) entitle any such
employee, independent contractor, director or officer to any gross up or
similar material payment in respect of the excise tax described in
Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has taken any action that would result in its incurring any
obligation for any payments or benefits described in subsections (A), (B) or
(C) of this Section 3.1(j)(x) (without regard to whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated) except to the extent required
in a written contract or agreement in existence as of the date of this
Agreement.    30     (xi) As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, claims or orders pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Employee Benefit Plan related to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan (other than claims in the Ordinary Course of
Business). As of the date of this Agreement, no Company Employee Benefit Plan
is subject to any ongoing audit, investigation or other administrative
proceeding of any governmental entity, and no Company Employee Benefit Plan
is the subject of any pending application for administrative relief under any
voluntary compliance program or closing agreement program of the IRS or the
Department of Labor.   (xii) The Company has the right to amend or terminate
each Company Employee Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any
liability other than with respect to benefits that have already accrued under
a Company Employee Pension Benefit Plan.   (xiii) Neither the Company nor
any Company ERISA Affiliate has a formal plan, commitment or proposal,
whether legally binding or not, nor has any of them made a commitment to
employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors to
create any additional Company Employee Benefit Plan or modify, change or
terminate any existing Company Employee Benefit Plan, and no such plan,
commitment or proposal is under serious consideration. To the knowledge of
the Company, no events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to
any Company Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the
cost of providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a
material change in the cost of providing for other liabilities of such
plan.   (xiv) None of the assets of any Company Employee Pension
Benefit Plan include "qualifying employer securities" or "qualifying employer
real property" within the meaning of Section 407(d) of ERISA.   (xv) As

health plan," as defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA, Section 5001(b)(1) of
the Code or 45 C.F.R. 160.103, has been operated at all times in material
compliance with the provisions of COBRA, HIPAA and any applicable, similar
state law. As used in this Agreement, "HIPAA" means the provisions of ERISA
and the Code enacted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, including any regulations thereunder, and the regulations
promulgated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services as
set forth in 45 C.F.R. Parts 160, 162, and 164.   (xvii) Each Company
Employee Pension Benefit Plan that is not qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded
plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
pursuant to Section 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No assets of
the Company are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar vehicle
with respect to any such plan.    31     (k) Labor Matters.   (i)

Intangible Property, except, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) of this
Section 3.1(l)(i), for any such conflict,    33    infringement,

Subsidiaries\' directors\' and officers\' liability insurance, primary and
excess casualty insurance policies providing coverage for bodily injury and

hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, all such insurance policies are in
full force and effect and all related premiums have been paid to date. As of
the Closing Date, all such insurance policies (or comparable replacement
policies) shall be in full force and effect and all related premiums shall
have been paid to date. There is no material claim by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending under any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
insurance policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriters of such policies. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice, which remains outstanding, of
cancellation or termination with respect to any material insurance
policy.   (o) Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of
the Company has received the opinion of Raymond James and Associates, Inc.
addressed to such Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,
the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders. The Company has provided a copy of such opinion to Parent.  
(p) Board Recommendation; Company Action; Vote Required. The Board
of Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly adopted by the directors
and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement, the Merger, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable
and in the best interests of the Company, (ii) approved and adopted this
Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) directed that the Merger and this Agreement be submitted for
consideration by the stockholders of the Company at a meeting of the
Company\'s stockholders and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of the
Company approve the Merger and this Agreement (provided that any change in or
modification or rescission of such recommendation by the Board of Directors
of the Company in accordance with Section 4.2(d) or Section 5.5(b) shall not
be a breach of the representation in this clause (iv)). The directors of the
Company have advised the Company that, as of the date hereof, they intend to
vote or cause to be voted all of the shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them and their affiliates in favor of approval of the
Merger and this Agreement. The    36    affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of Company capital stock necessary
to approve the Merger and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company (the "Stockholder Approval"). Other than the
Stockholder Approval, no vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company capital stock is necessary to approve the Merger and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other antitakeover statute or
similar statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws applies or purports to
apply to the Company Common Stock, this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be prohibited from
entering into a "business combination" with the Company as an "interested
stockholder" (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL or
the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation) as a result of the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (q) Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.1(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company,

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for claims for accrued vacation
pay or accrued benefits under any Company Employee Benefit Plan existing on
the date hereof, (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, has made, on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any payment or commitment to pay any

entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions    37    contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.  
(t) Amendment to Rights Agreement.   (i) The Board of Directors of the
Company, by execution of the Rights Agreement Amendment, has taken all
necessary action to amend the Company Rights Agreement so that none of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Article II of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby will cause: (A) the Company Rights to
become exercisable under the Company Rights Agreement; (B) Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the
Company Rights Agreement); (C) a "Shares Acquisition Date" (as defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event; or (D) a
"Distribution Date" (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) to occur
upon any such event.   (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company
Rights have not separated from Company Common Stock and no distribution of

adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Company has made available to Parent a summary
of (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect the Company\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, (B) any material weaknesses in
the Company\'s internal controls, and (C) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting.   (v)
Governmental Regulation. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries of
the Company is subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act, the
Interstate    38    Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940

SEC. The Company has no knowledge of any material errors in such underlying
factual information supplied to Cawley, Gillespie and Associates, Inc. for
purposes of preparing such report and the conclusions in such report are not
in any material way unreasonable when compared with the Company\'s own
evaluation of the properties included in such report as of December 31, 2005
taken as a whole. Except for changes (including changes in commodity prices)
generally affecting the oil and gas industry, to the knowledge of the Company
there has been no material adverse change with respect to the matters

to such disclosure schedule qualifies the referenced representation and
warranty to the extent specified therein and such other representations and
warranties contained herein (regardless of whether or not such representation
or warranty contains a reference to such disclosure schedule) to the extent a
matter in such disclosure schedule is disclosed in such a way as to make its
relevance to the information called for by such other representation or
warranty readily apparent on its face)):   (a) Organization, Standing and
Power. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and its Significant Subsidiaries (as

jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation,
ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification
and licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions   
43    where the failure so to be qualified and licensed could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has heretofore delivered or made

Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as compared to other industry
participants).   (b) Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the authorized

and timely obtained or made, any judgment, order, decree, statute, law,

or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clause (B) or (C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, liens,
security interests, charges, encumbrances or detriments that, individually or
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   (iii) No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from
any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this

failure to obtain or make could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (d)
SEC Documents. Parent has made available to the Company a true and complete
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement, definitive
proxy statement and exhibit to the foregoing documents filed by Parent with
the SEC since December 31, 2003 (the "Parent SEC Documents"), which include
all the documents (other than preliminary material) that Parent was required
to file with the SEC since December 31, 2003. As of their respective dates,
the Parent SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents were
prepared from the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X    46    of the SEC) and
fairly present in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP (subject,
in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments,
none of which are material) the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and
the consolidated results of operations and the consolidated cash flows of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein.
As of the date hereof, Parent is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act.   (e) Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Except as disclosed in, or reflected in the financial statements
included in, the Parent SEC Documents, or as contemplated by this Agreement,
since December 31, 2005, Parent has conducted its business only in the
Ordinary Course of Business, and there has not been: (i) any material damage,
destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not covered by insurance)
affecting the business or assets owned or operated by the Parent and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) any event, condition, action or occurrence that, if taken
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
would constitute a breach of Section 4.1(b); or (iii) any other transaction,
commitment, dispute or other event or condition (financial or otherwise) of
any character (whether or not in the Ordinary Course of Business) that has
resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   (f) Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(f) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no
suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent ("Parent
Litigation"), and Parent and its Subsidiaries have no knowledge of any facts
that are likely to give rise to any Parent Litigation, that (in any case)
could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent that could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty in this Section 3.2(f) is made with respect to Environmental Laws,
which are covered exclusively by the provisions in Section 3.2(o).   (g) No
Undisclosed Material Liabilities. As of the date hereof, there are no
liabilities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise, that have resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, other than: (i) liabilities adequately
provided for on the balance sheet of Parent dated as of March 31, 2006
(including the notes thereto) contained in Parent\'s Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006; (ii) liabilities incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice since March
31, 2006; (iii) any other liabilities that, taken as a whole, do not exceed
$500,000 in the aggregate and (iv) liabilities under this Agreement.   (h)
No Default. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of Parent (each as amended to date) or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument, permit, concession,    47    franchise or license to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is bound
(except for the requirement under certain of such instruments to file
supplemental indentures as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby)
or (iii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of (ii)
and (iii) for defaults or violations which in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (i)
Compliance with Applicable Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of
all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses (the "Parent Permits"), except where the failure
so to hold could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms
of the Parent Permits, except where the failure so to comply could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity,
except for possible violations which could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this Section
3.2(i) is made with respect to Taxes, ERISA matters or Environmental Laws,
which are covered exclusively by the provisions set forth in Sections 3.2(j),
(k) and (l). As of the date of this Agreement, no investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, threatened,
other than those the outcome of which could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (j) Taxes. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.2(j) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule:   (i) Each of Parent,
each of its Subsidiaries and any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary
or similar group of which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a

account any extensions) all material Tax Returns required to be filed or sent
by or with respect to it and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects, (B) duly paid or deposited on a timely
basis all material Taxes that are shown to be due and payable on or with
respect to such Tax Returns, and all material Taxes that are otherwise due
and payable for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, (C)
established reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes
not yet due and payable with respect to the results of operations of Parent
and its Subsidiaries through the date hereof, and (D) complied in
all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
relating to the reporting, payment and withholding of Taxes that are required
to be withheld from payments to employees, independent contractors,
creditors, stockholders or any other third party and has in all material
respects timely withheld from employee wages and paid over to the proper
governmental authorities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid
over.   (ii) Parent has previously made available to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of (A) all income and other material Tax
Returns filed by or on behalf of Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent and any
Parent Group for the last three completed Tax years    48    that
remain open for audit or review by the relevant taxing authority and (B) all
material ruling requests, private letter rulings, notices of
proposed deficiencies, closing agreements, settlement agreements and any
similar documents or communications sent or received by or on behalf of
Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any Parent Group relating to Taxes. No
unresolved audits or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings
are pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, with regard to any
Taxes for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries would be liable, and no
unpaid material deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or
assessed (whether by examination report or prior to completion of examination
by means of notices of proposed adjustment or other similar requests or
notices) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by any taxing authority
with respect to any period that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. All material Hedging transactions entered into by Parent and its
Subsidiaries have been properly identified for federal income tax purposes.
No material claim is pending and no material claim has ever been made that
has not been resolved by an authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent does not file Tax Returns that Parent or such
Subsidiary of Parent, as the case may be, is or may be subject to Tax in that
jurisdiction.   (iii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
executed or entered into with the IRS or any taxing authority (A) any
unexpired agreement or other document extending or having the effect of
extending the period for assessment or collection of any Taxes for which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries would be liable or the filing of any Tax
Return required to be filed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) a
closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local, foreign or other income tax law, which will
require any increase in taxable income or alternative minimum taxable income,
or any reduction in tax credits, for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent is subject to any private letter ruling of the IRS or
comparable ruling of other tax authorities that will be binding on Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent with respect to any period following the Closing
Date. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has granted any power of
attorney, which is currently in force with respect to any income, franchise
or similar Taxes or any income, franchise or similar Tax Returns.   (iv)
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has
any obligation under any Tax sharing, indemnity or allocation agreement or
similar agreement, arrangement or practice in effect under which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries could be liable for any material Taxes of any person
or entity other than Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of another person
or entity (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6, any similar provision of state and local law, as
a transferee, by contract, or otherwise.   (v) There are no requests for
material rulings or outstanding material subpoenas from any taxing authority
for information with respect to Taxes of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
and no material reassessments (for property or ad valorem Tax purposes) of
any assets or any property owned or leased by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries have been proposed in written form.   (vi) Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any material amount in
income for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date as a   
49    result of a change in accounting method for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or pursuant to any agreement with any
taxing authority with respect to any such taxable period. Neither Parent nor
any Subsidiary of Parent will be required to include in any period ending
after the Closing Date any income that accrued in a prior period but was not
recognized in any prior period as a result of the installment method of
accounting, the completed contract method of accounting, the long-term
contract method of accounting, the cash method of accounting, or
otherwise.   (vii) None of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any
affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of which any of
Parent or its Subsidiaries is or was a member has participated, directly or
indirectly, in any (A) reportable transaction within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) or (B) Tax shelter required to be registered
under Section 6111 of the Code. Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent has
disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that
could, if not so disclosed, give rise to a substantial understatement penalty
within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.   (k) Employee Benefit
Plans; ERISA. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement:   (i) There
are no Parent Employee Benefit Plans established, maintained, contributed to
or required to be contributed to, by Parent or any entity with which Parent
is considered a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code ("Parent ERISA Affiliates") or which Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate has established, maintained, contributed to, or been required to
contribute to, within six years prior to the Effective Time. As used in this
Agreement, "Parent Employee Benefit Plan" means any plan, program, policy,
practice, agreement or other arrangement providing compensation or benefits
in any form to any current or former employee, independent
contractor, officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent or
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, whether written or unwritten, formal or
informal, including without limitation any "employee welfare benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Parent Employee Welfare Benefit
Plan"), any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) ("Parent
Employee Pension Benefit Plan") and any other pension, profit-sharing, bonus,
incentive compensation, deferred compensation, vacation, sick pay, stock
purchase, stock option, phantom equity, equity compensation, severance,
employment, consulting, unemployment, hospitalization or other medical, life
or other insurance, long or short-term disability, change of control,
material fringe benefit, or any other plan, program or policy.   (ii) With
respect to each Parent Employee Benefit Plan, Parent has provided Company
with a true, correct and complete copy of: (A) each writing constituting a
part of such Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including, but not limited to, the
plan document(s), adoption agreement, prototype or volume submitter
documents, trust agreement, annuity contract, third party administrative
contracts and insurance contracts) and all amendments thereto; (B) the three
most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) including all applicable
schedules, if required; (C) the current summary plan description and any
material modifications thereto, if required to be furnished under ERISA,
or any written summary provided to participants with respect to any plan for
which no summary plan description exists; (D) the most    50   recent
determination letter (or if applicable, advisory or opinion letter) from the
IRS, if any, or if an application for a determination letter is pending,
the application with all attachments; (E) all notices given to such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan, Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate by the IRS,
Department of Labor, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or other
governmental agency relating to such Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and (F) a
written description of each oral Company Employee Benefit Plan.   (iii)
Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable,
Section 401(k) of the Code ("Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plan"), has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that has not been
revoked or is a prototype plan subject to an IRS opinion letter, and no event
has occurred and no condition exists that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent Employee Benefit
Plan. Any favorable determination letters referenced in this Section
3.2(k)(iii) cover "GUST" as defined in footnote 2 of IRS Notice 2003-49. Each
Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plan has timely made "good faith"
amendments to comply with the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Relief
Act of 2001 as required by IRS Notice 2001-42. The trusts established under
the Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plans are exempt from federal income
taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code and any potential excise taxes.  
(iv) Parent has (A) filed or caused to be filed all returns and reports on
the Parent Employee Benefit Plans that are required to be filed and (B) paid
or made adequate provision for all fees, interest, penalties, assessments or
deficiencies that have become due pursuant to those returns or reports or
pursuant to any assessment or adjustment that has been made relating to those
returns or reports. All other material fees, interest, penalties
and assessments that are payable by or for Parent and its Subsidiaries
relating to the Company Employee Benefit Plans have been timely reported,
fully paid and discharged. There are no material unpaid fees, penalties,
interest or assessments due from Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, from
any other person or entity, relative to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan.
Parent and its Subsidiaries have collected or withheld all amounts that are
required to be collected or withheld by them to discharge their obligations
with respect to the Parent Employee Benefit Plans, and all of those amounts
have been paid to the appropriate governmental authority or set aside in
appropriate accounts for future payment when due.   (v) The funding, if
any, under each Parent Employee Welfare Benefit Plan does not exceed and has
not exceeded the limitations under Sections 419A(b) and 419A(c) of the Code.
Parent and its Subsidiaries are not subject to taxation on the income of any
Parent Employee Welfare Benefit Plan\'s welfare benefit fund (as such term is
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) under Section 419A(g) of the Code. All
Parent Welfare Employee Benefit Plans required to comply with the COBRA
provisions of ERISA and the Code have complied with such requirements in all
material respects.   (vi) Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
provisions. All contributions required to be made to any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan (or to any person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been
timely made or the amount of such payment or contribution obligation has been
reflected in the Parent SEC Documents which are publicly available prior to
the date of this    51    Agreement. All such contributions
representing participant contributions have been made within the time
required by Department of Labor regulation section 2510.3-102.   (vii)
Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all
material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
regulations applicable to the Parent Employee Benefit Plans. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any prohibited transaction, within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, as a
fiduciary or party in interest with respect to any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, (A) no prohibited transaction has occurred with
respect to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan and (B) no fiduciary has
any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or
comply in connection with the administration or investment of assets of any
Parent Employee Benefit Plan.   (viii) Neither Parent nor any entity that
is or has been a Parent ERISA Affiliate within the six years preceding the
date of this Agreement has within the six year period preceding the date of
this Agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. No Parent Employee Welfare Plan is a
multiple employee welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA.   (ix) Parent and its Subsidiaries have not offered to provide life,
health or medical benefits or insurance coverage to any individual, or to the
family members of any individual, for any period extending beyond
the termination of the individual\'s employment, except to the extent
required by the COBRA provisions in ERISA and the Code or similar provisions
of state law.   (x) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in connection with termination
of employment, (A) entitle any current or former employee, independent
contractor, director or officer of Parent or its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, any change in control payment or any other material payment, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, change the form or method of payment or increase the amount of
compensation due, any such employee, independent contractor, director or
officer, or (C) entitle any such employee, independent contractor, director
or officer to any gross-up or similar material payment in respect of the
excise tax described in Section 4999 of the Code. Neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent has taken any action that would result in its incurring
any obligation for any payments or benefits described in subsections (A), (B)
or (C) of this Section 3.2(k)(x) (without regard to whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated) except to the extent required
in a written contract or agreement in existence as of the date of this
Agreement.   (xi) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, claims, or orders pending or, to
the knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent, any Subsidiary
of Parent, or any Parent Employee Benefit Plan related to any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan (other than claims in the Ordinary Course of Business).
As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no Parent
Employee Benefit Plan is subject to any ongoing audit, investigation or other
administrative proceeding of    52    any governmental entity, and no
Parent Employee Benefit Plan is the subject of any pending application for
administrative relief under any voluntary compliance program or closing
agreement program of the IRS or the Department of Labor.   (xii) Parent has
the right to amend or terminate each Parent Employee Benefit Plan at any time
without incurring any liability other than with respect to benefits that have
already accrued under a Parent Employee Pension Benefit Plan.   (xiii)
Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has a formal plan, commitment
or proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has any of them made a
commitment to employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent
contractors to create any additional Parent Employee Benefit Plan or modify,
change or terminate any existing Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and no such
plan, commitment or proposal is under serious consideration. To the knowledge
of Parent, no events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to
any Parent Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the
cost of providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a
material change in the cost of providing for other liabilities of such
plan.   (xiv) None of the assets of any Parent Employee Pension
Benefit Plan include "qualifying employer securities" or "qualifying employer
real property" within the meaning of Section 407(d) of ERISA.   (xv) Each
Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan," as defined in
Section 607(1) of ERISA, Section 5001(b)(1) of the Code or 45 C.F.R. 160.103,
has been operated at all times in material compliance with the provisions of
COBRA, HIPAA and any applicable, similar state law.   (xvi) Each Parent
Employee Pension Benefit Plan that is not qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is exempt from part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded
plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No assets of
Parent are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar vehicle with
respect to any such plan.   (l) Labor Matters.   (i) Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or
other current labor agreement with any labor union or organization, and there
is no current union representation question involving employees of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, nor does Parent or any of its Subsidiaries know of
any activity or proceeding of any labor organization (or representative
thereof) or employee group (or representative thereof) to organize any such
employees.   (ii) As of the date hereof, there is no unfair labor
practice charge or grievance arising out of a collective bargaining agreement
or other grievance procedure against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
pending, or, to the knowledge or Parent, threatened, that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.    53     (iii) As of the date hereof, there is no complaint,
lawsuit or proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any present or former
employee, any applicant for employment or any classes of the foregoing
alleging breach of any express or implied contract of employment, any law or
regulation governing employment or the termination thereof or other
discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship against Parent pending, or, to the knowledge of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  
(iv) There is no strike, dispute, slowdown, work stoppage, or lockout
pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against or involving
Parent, or any of its Subsidiaries that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (v) Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health, except
for non-compliance that does not constitute, and could reasonably be expected
to result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (vi) As of the date
hereof, there is no proceeding, claim, suit, action or governmental
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, threatened, in respect to which any current or former director,
officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
entitled to claim indemnification from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to (A) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws (each as amended to date) of Parent or any provision of the comparable
charter or other organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any
indemnification agreement to which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is a
party or (C) applicable law, in each case under clauses (A), (B) and (C) that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   (m) Property.   (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries possess
or have adequate rights to use all material trademarks, trade names, patents,
service marks, brand marks, brand names, computer programs, databases,
industrial designs, domain names and copyrights necessary for the operation
of the businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Parent Intangible Property"), except where the failure to possess or have
adequate rights to use such properties could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All of the Parent Intangible
Property is owned or licensed by Parent or its Subsidiaries free and clear of
any and all liens, claims or encumbrances, except those that could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect and
neither Parent nor any such Subsidiary has forfeited or otherwise
relinquished any Parent Intangible Property which forfeiture could reasonably
be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge
of Parent, the use of the Parent Intangible Property by Parent or its
Subsidiaries does not, in any material respect, conflict with, infringe upon,
violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right, title,
interest or goodwill, including, without limitation, any intellectual
property right, trademark, trade name, patent, service mark, brand mark,
brand name,    54    computer program, database, industrial design,
domain name, copyright or any pending application therefor of any other
person. There have been no claims made and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice of any claim or otherwise knows that (A)
any of the Parent Intangible Property is invalid or conflicts with the
asserted rights of any other person or (B) any of the Parent Intangible
Property has not been used or enforced or has failed to have been used or
enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of any of the Parent Intangible Property, except, in the
case of clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 3.2(m)(i), for any such conflict,
infringement, violation, interference, claim, invalidity, abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability that could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) All material items of
operating equipment owned or leased by Parent and its Subsidiaries (A) are,
in the aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be adequate in all material
respects for reasonably prudent operations in the areas in which they are
operated and (B) are adequate, together with all other properties of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, to comply in all material respect with the requirements
of all applicable contracts, including sales contracts. Except for goods and
other property sold, used or otherwise disposed of since January 1, 2006 in
the Ordinary Course of Business, Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and
defensible title to all oil and gas properties forming the basis for the
reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports (as hereinafter defined) as
attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and to all
other properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal,
reflected in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement as owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of
any liens, except: (A) liens reflected in the Parent SEC Documents filed

schedule of Parent\'s and each of its Subsidiaries\' directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance, primary and excess casualty insurance
policies providing coverage for bodily injury and property damage to third

controls which could adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, (B) any material weaknesses in Parent\'s
internal controls, and (C) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

internal control over financial reporting.   (ii) Parent has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent required to be disclosed in Parent\'s Exchange Act reports is made
known to Parent\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within Parent and its Subsidiaries, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent\'s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in Parent\'s periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act.   (iii) Parent is, or will timely be, in compliance in all
material respects with all current and proposed listing and corporate
governance requirements of the NYSE, and is in compliance in all material
respects, and will continue to remain in compliance in all material respects
from the date hereof until immediately after the Effective Time, with all
rules, regulations and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
SEC.   (s) Investment Company. Neither Parent nor any of the Subsidiaries
of Parent is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.   (t) Reserve

and Parent\'s Subsidiaries\' oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2005,
audited by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. and Wright
and Company, Inc. (the "Parent Reserve Reports"). As concerns the Parent
Reserve Reports, (i) the factual, non-interpretive data on which the Parent
Reserve Reports were based for purposes of estimating the oil and
gas reserves set forth in the Parent Reserve Reports was accurate in all
material respects as of the time of delivery and (ii) the estimates of proved
reserves used by Parent in connection    57    with the preparation of
the Parent Reserve Reports and provided by Parent to each of DeGolyer and
MacNaughton, H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. and Wright and Company, Inc. in
connection with its audit of the Parent Reserve Reports are in accordance
with definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X promulgated by
the SEC.   (u) Hedging. The Parent SEC Documents accurately summarize
the outstanding Hedging positions attributable to the production of Parent
and the Subsidiaries of Parent as of the date reflected therein. Parent has
previously delivered to the Company a schedule of all material Hedging
positions of Parent and its Subsidiaries in place as of the date hereof
(including those entered into in contemplation of this Agreement).   (v)
Natural Gas Act. No gas gathering system constituting a part of the
properties of Parent or its Subsidiaries has as its primary function
the provision of natural gas gathering services, as the term "gathering"
is interpreted under Section 1(b) of the NGA; none of the properties have
been or are certificated by FERC under Section 7(c) of the NGA or to the
knowledge of Parent are now subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA; and
none of the properties have been or are providing service pursuant to Section
311 of the NGA.   (w) Certain Contracts and Arrangements. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any agreement or other
arrangement that limits or otherwise restricts Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective
Time, materially limit or restrict Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of Parent\'s other Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, from engaging or
competing in the oil and gas exploration and production business in any
significant geographic area, except for joint ventures, area of mutual
interest agreements entered into in connection with prospect reviews and
similar arrangements entered into the Ordinary Course of Business. Documents
filed or incorporated by reference in Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2005 set forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, a true and complete list of each agreement to which Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent is subject (other than this Agreement) that is of a type
that is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 601 of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC (collectively, the "Parent Contracts"). Except as
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is in breach or default
under any Parent Contract nor, to the knowledge of Parent, is any other party
to any such Parent Contract in breach or default thereunder. Other than as
contemplated by Section 3.2(c), no consents, assignments, waivers,
authorization or other certificates or material payments are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of the Parent Contracts after
the Closing, except to the extent the failure to obtain any such consent,
assignment, waiver, authorization or other certificate, individually or in
the aggregate, has not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (x) Reorganization
Classification. Parent has not taken any action that causes the Merger and
the LLC Sub Merger not to qualify as a reorganization, within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and has not failed to take any action which if
taken would have prevented the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger from not
qualifying as such a reorganization. Merger Sub has not taken any action that
causes the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger not to qualify as such a
reorganization and has not failed to take any action which if taken
would have    58    prevented the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger from
not qualifying as such a reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
except as required by clause (y) of Section 2.1(b), under no circumstances
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to alter or amend the Merger
Consideration to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and under no circumstances shall the
failure so to alter or amend the Merger Consideration be deemed a breach of
this Section 3.2(x).   ARTICLE IV  COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT  OF

or inquiry to the extent not previously provided to Parent; provided that
this clause (B) does not affect the restrictions on the delivery of
information to any such person otherwise imposed by this Section 4.2.  
(ii) The Company shall provide Parent with seventy-two (72) hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of
its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its
Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 4.2(a) and under circumstances in which the Company has complied with
all of its obligations under Section 4.2(a) and 4.2(b), in the event that,
prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the    65    Company
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
its Board of Directors (or a special committee thereof) has in good faith
concluded (following consultation with and the receipt of advice from its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) is, or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Offer, the Company may then take the following
actions prior to, but not after, the Stockholder Approval if the Company\'s
Board of Directors, after consultation with and the receipt of advice from
its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such actions are
required by the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties
imposed by applicable law: (i) furnish nonpublic information to the third
party making such Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A) (1) prior to or
concurrently with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such party,
the Company gives Parent written notice of its intention to furnish nonpublic
information and (2) the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such
third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as
the terms (including the standstill terms regarding limitations on actions,
transactions and proposals with respect to the Company and its securities)
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and containing additional
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of
this Section 4.2), and the Company provides a copy of such confidentiality
agreement to Parent, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any nonpublic
information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to
Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished); and (ii) engage in negotiations with the third party with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal, provided that concurrently with entering into
negotiations with such third party, it gives Parent written notice of its
intention to enter into negotiations with such third party.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt
of the Stockholder Approval, to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify,
or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, its
recommendation in favor of the Merger, and, in the case of a Superior Offer
that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its stockholders, may
recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer (any of
the foregoing actions, whether by a Board of Directors or a committee
thereof, a "Change of Recommendation"), if, after consultation with and the
receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel, the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith that withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation is required by such Board of Directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties imposed by applicable law and, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, if all of the following conditions in clauses (i)
through (iv) are met: (i) a Superior Offer shall have been made and shall not
have been withdrawn; (ii) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent
written notice which shall state expressly (1) that the Company has received
a Superior Offer, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer
(including the most current version of any definitive agreement proposed to
be entered into in connection therewith) and the identity of the person,
entity or Group making the Superior Offer, and (3) that the Company intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do
so, and (B) made available to Parent all materials and information made
available to the person, entity or Group making the Superior Offer
in connection with such Superior Offer that were not previously made
available to Parent; (iii) at least five business days shall have elapsed
since the Company provided the written notice to Parent described in clause
(ii)(A) of this Section 4.2(d) and Parent shall not have made an offer that
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have concluded in good
faith    66    (following consultation with and receipt of advice from
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable,
from a financial point of view, to the Company stockholders as such Superior
Offer; (iv) and the Company shall not have breached the provisions in Section
4.2(a) or Section 4.2(d) and shall not have breached, in any material
respect, any of the other provisions set forth in this Section 4.2 and shall
not then be in breach of this Section 4.2.   (e) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and subject to Section 5.3(b),
the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold its
stockholders\' meeting as contemplated in Section 5.3 shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by a Change of Recommendation unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(g). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the Company shall not (i) submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) enter into any
agreement, agreement-in-principle or letter of intent (other than the
confidentiality agreement referenced in Section 4.2(c)) with respect to
or accept any Acquisition Proposal (or resolve to or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing).   (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a
third party pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to
the extent required by applicable law; provided that the content of any such
disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the Company shall not make a Change
of Recommendation to recommend that its stockholders accept a tender or
exchange offer unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section
4.2(d).   (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have
the following meanings: (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates) relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (A) any purchase from the Company or acquisition by
any person, entity or "Group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent
(15%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person, entity or Group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company, (B) other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more than fifteen

whole, or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide

Company (A) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company has in good
faith concluded (following consultation with and the receipt of advice from
its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser), taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
offer, the person, entity or Group making the offer, the source of financing
and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.2, to be    67    more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company\'s stockholders (in
their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the Merger and
is reasonably capable of being consummated, (B) for which financing, to the
extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, following consultation
with and the receipt of advice from the Company\'s financial advisor, is
reasonably capable of being financed by such third party, and (C) that the
Board of Directors of the Company, in its good faith reasonable judgment,
following consultation with and the receipt of advice from the Company\'s
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, determines is reasonably capable
of being consummated without undue delay on the terms proposed.   ARTICLE
V  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   5.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement.   (a)
Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, but in any event by no later than May 19, 2006, prepare and

"Proxy Statement"). The Proxy Statement shall (i) include copies of Parent\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, Parent\'s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and
Parent\'s Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 19,

incorporate such documents by reference into the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement shall also include pro forma financial information for Parent and
the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.   (b) The
information supplied by each of Parent and the Company in the Proxy Statement
shall not, at the date such materials (or any supplement thereto) are first
mailed to such stockholders, at the time of the Stockholders\' Meeting or at
the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates is discovered by Parent or
the Company that should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
Parent and the Company, as the case may be shall supplement such
material.   (c) The materials to be included in the Proxy Statement in the
mailing to holders of Company Common Stock shall include (i) with respect to
Eligible Holders, the Eligible Holder Election Materials and (ii) with
respect to holders of Company Common Stock that are not Eligible Holders, the
Non-Eligible Holder Election Materials. In the event Parent determines any
supplemental information or materials are appropriate to be provided to the
holders of Company Common Stock (x) prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval or (y) after receipt of the Stockholder Approval if there is a Stock
Consideration Shortfall, to determine whether such holder qualifies as an
accredited investor and otherwise satisfies the investor suitability
standards required as set forth in the Investor Questionnaire and Election
Form, then the Company shall cooperate with Parent in providing such
materials to or communicating with such holders and obtaining appropriate
representations and certifications or any clarification or   
68    further communication with such holders as appropriate in accordance
with applicable securities laws, as reasonably determined by Parent as
necessary to enable the Parent to effect an issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(y)).   5.2
Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, Parent and the Company, as the
case may be shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, as well as to its officers and employees
and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company, as the case may be,
shall (and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed with the SEC or received by it from the
SEC and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Each of Parent and the
Company agree that it will not, and will cause its respective representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2 for any
purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of February 15, 2006
between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall apply
with respect to information furnished thereunder or hereunder and any other
activities contemplated thereby.   5.3 Stockholders\' Meeting.   (a) The
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its
organizational documents to call, hold and convene a special meeting of the
Company\'s stockholders to consider the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger (the "Stockholders\' Meeting"), to be held as promptly as practicable
after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders, but in no event
later than June 19, 2006 (unless the Stockholders\' Meeting is adjourned or
postponed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.3(a));
provided that, the Company shall not be in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence if the Stockholders\' Meeting is not held on or before
June 19, 2006, because Parent failed to provide to the Company information
regarding Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (which information both
Parent and the Company mutually agreed to include in the Proxy Statement) in
order for the Proxy Statement to be distributed to holders of Company Common
Stock on or before May 19, 2006. Subject to Section 4.2(d) and 5.3(b), the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and shall
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
its stockholders required by the DGCL to obtain such approvals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 7.1(c), (i) the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders\' Meeting if as of the time for which the Stockholders\' Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of capital stock of the Company represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Stockholders\' Meeting, and (ii) Parent may require the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Stockholders\' Meeting if as of the time for which
the Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(h) shall not be satisfied;
provided that, in the event the Stockholders\' Meeting is delayed to a date
after the Initial Termination Date as a result of the reasons set forth
in this sentence, then the Initial Termination Date shall be extended to a
date no later than the    69    fifth business day after the Initial
Termination Date. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Stockholders\' Meeting without
the consent of Parent. The Company shall ensure that the Stockholders\'
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all
proxies solicited, by it in connection with the Stockholders\' Meeting are
solicited in compliance with the DGCL, its organizational documents and all
other applicable laws.   (b) Except to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 4.2(d): (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall unanimously
recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
of this Agreement and the Merger at the Stockholders\' Meeting, (ii) the
Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of
Directors of the Company has unanimously recommended that the Company\'s
stockholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
at the Stockholders\' Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Company\'s Board of Directors
that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger.   5.4 Third Party Consents; Approvals.   (a) The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in
promptly obtaining the written consent, waiver or approval from any party to
a Company Contract identified on Schedule 3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as requiring the consent, waiver of approval of another party
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, in obtaining any such consent, without the prior
written consent of Parent, (i) take any action prohibited by Section 4.2, or
(ii) otherwise modify or amend any Company Contract or agree to or incur any
liability or obligation for which the Surviving Corporation would have any
responsibility after the Effective Time.   (b) Each party hereto shall
cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity required to be
obtained or made by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.   5.5 Employee and Benefit Plan
Matters.   (a) Parent and the Company agree that all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time solely on an "at will" basis, it being
understood that the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligations to
continue employing such employees for any length of time thereafter.   
70    (b) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that on
and after the Effective Time employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue in the
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time shall be provided employee benefits, plans and programs which,
in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those made available by
Parent and its Subsidiaries to similar situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.   (c) Parent shall, no later than sixty days following the end
of the calendar year that includes the Effective Time, pay to each employee
of the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof on and after the
Effective Time who was an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who, as of the Effective Time,
had paid or incurred deductible(s) for benefits under the Company\'s or its
Subsidiary\'s medical plan in the plan year that includes the Closing Date in
an amount in excess of $500, an amount equal to the difference of (i) the
amount equal to the sum of (A) the deductible(s) paid or incurred by such
employee for benefits under the Company\'s or its Subsidiary\'s medical plan
in the plan year that includes the Closing Date, and (B) the deductible(s)
paid or incurred by such employee for benefits under the Range Resources
Corporation Welfare Benefit Plan in the plan year that includes the Closing
Date, minus (ii) $1,000.00 (to the extent such amount is a positive
number).   (d) Parent shall take all reasonable steps necessary to cause
the Company\'s 401(k) plan to be merged with and into Parent\'s 401(k) plan
in which employees of the Surviving Corporation will participate after the
Effective Time on or before January 1, 2007 (it being expressly agreed that
the participants in the Company\'s 401(k) plan shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.5(d), each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this Section 5.5(d)).   (e) Parent has previously delivered to the
Company copies of each of the letters offering employment to the employees of
the Company listed on Schedule 5.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and
Parent will offer to employ such employees as of the Effective Time on the
terms set forth in such letters.   (f) In the event that, within the period
beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the last day of the twelfth
full calendar month following the calendar month in which the Effective Time
occurs, any person who is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than those
employees listed on Schedule 5.5(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
incurs an "Involuntary Termination of Employment" (as defined in Parent\'s
Employee Change of Control and Severance Pay Plan as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) from the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall pay
severance benefits to such employee in an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of
such employee\'s Base Salary (as defined in Parent\'s Employee Change of
Control and Severance Pay Plan as in effect on the date of
this Agreement).   (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will make
cash payments to certain employees of the Company in the amounts set forth on
Schedule 5.5(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.    71     (h)
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt (or cause the
sponsoring Subsidiary to adopt) a resolution fully vesting all employer
contributions made prior to the Closing Date under the 401(k) plan in which
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries participate.   (i) Parent and
Company agree that Patrick J. Noyes ("Noyes") will resign as President, Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company at
the request of Parent as of the Effective Time and that (i) such resignation
will be deemed to constitute an involuntary termination of employment other
than for "Cause" for purposes of the Employment Agreement between Noyes and
the Company dated October 1, 2005, (ii) Noyes will be entitled to the
severance payment specified on Schedule 5.5(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the health insurance continuation benefits specified in Section
6(c) of that agreement, and (iii) all Company Options held by Noyes shall be
fully vested and all restrictions on Company Restricted Stock held by Noyes
shall lapse immediately prior to his resignation.   5.6 Stock Options and
Restricted Stock.   (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be (i) assumed by Parent in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan
and option agreement, together with amendments thereto, by which it is
evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, as the case may be, shall be
substituted for the Company and its Board of Directors and Compensation
Committee administering any such Company Stock Plan, and (ii) converted into
an option to acquire the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, which converted option shall be exercisable
on the terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option and
the applicable Company Stock Plan (except as described below) for the
aggregate exercise price equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock stated in such Company Option (such that, upon
conversion of the Company Option into an option for an aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, then the exercise price per whole share of
Parent Common Stock for that converted option will be equal to the quotient
of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock stated in such
Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio). "Company Options" means
any option granted, and not exercised, expired or terminated, to a current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any
Subsidiaries of the Company or any predecessor thereof to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or any other
contract or agreement entered into by the Company or any Subsidiaries of the
Company. In the event that the exercise of any Company Option would result in
the issuance of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock, then (i) if the
Company Option is subject to a Company Stock Plan that addresses the
treatment of such fractional share, such fractional share shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of such Company Stock Plan, or (ii) if the Company
Option is subject to a Company Stock Plan that does not address the treatment
of such fractional share, such holder shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment for such fractional share based upon the last reported sale price per
share of Parent Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
date of exercise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of   
72    any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
its qualification under any of Sections 422-424 of the Code, the option
price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to
comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 5.6, the term, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code, if applicable, all applicable restrictions or limitations on
transfer and all other terms and conditions of the Company Options will, to
the extent permitted by law and applicable agreements and plans and otherwise
reasonably practicable, be unchanged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
Company Options shall be fully exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the provisions of this
Section 5.6(a).   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time and in any event within two business days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Company Options to be assumed under paragraph (a) above that
are held by holders the issuance to which is eligible to be covered on a Form
S-8 to be registered on Form S-8 (or any successor form), and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Options remain
outstanding (it being expressly agreed that the holders of the assumed
Company Options shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6(b),
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.6(b)).   (c) As
soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to each holder of an assumed Company Option an appropriate notice
setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant to such Company Option.
The Company and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable actions which
are necessary in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6
as of the Effective Time. Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of the Company Options.   (d) Concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company is delivering to
Parent the Option Cancellation Agreements and Option Modification Agreements
listed on Schedule 5.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule executed by the
applicable optionees and shall take all actions necessary to enforce such
agreements prior to the Effective Time. Within three days of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to Parent the Option
Conditional Exercise Agreements listed on Schedule 5.6(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule executed by the applicable optionees and shall take all
actions necessary to enforce such agreements prior to the Effective Time.  
(e) All restrictions on shares of Company Restricted Stock shall lapse and
the restricted period shall end immediately prior to the Effective Time.
As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the provisions of this
Section 5.6(e).    73     5.7 Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance.   (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification
by the Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
or an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or who acts as
a fiduciary under any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each a "Company
Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof,
copies of which have been provided to Parent, including provisions relating
to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit,
shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses,
judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions
in such person\'s capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to pay and perform in a timely manner such
indemnification obligations.   (b) The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.7
applies for a period of six years from the Effective Time without the consent
of such affected Company Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that
the Company Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 5.7).   (c) Within two days after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall execute and deliver to Parent letters
changing the broker of record on the Company\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policies to an insurance broker designated by Parent.
Upon delivery of such letters, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange to procure, and shall prior to the Effective Time procure
(and the Company shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these
efforts), through such insurance broker designated by Parent a run-off
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy for the
Company\'s current policies to be effective from and after the Effective Time
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to
the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such
insurance, which policy, without any lapse in coverage, will provide coverage
for a period of six years after the Effective Time (or the Surviving
Corporation otherwise will maintain coverage for such period) and contain
terms and conditions which are substantially comparable to the Company\'s
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy.   (d) In
the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, in each such case, Parent shall ensure that proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or all or substantially all of its assets shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7 (it being agreed that this Section
5.7(d) shall be deemed satisfied if such obligations become the obligations
of any such successor or assign by operation of law).    74     5.8
Agreement to Defend. In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or
other proceeding by any governmental body or other person or other legal or
administrative proceeding is commenced that questions the validity or
legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto.   5.9 Public Announcements. The parties hereto will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the consent of the other parties, except as may be reasonably
determined to be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or transaction

disclosing party of such press release or public statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, (a) promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by all of the parties
hereto, each of Parent and the Company shall issue separate press releases
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement (provided that, prior
to the public dissemination of each such press release, each shall provide to
the other a draft of such press release and an opportunity to provide
comments thereon, which comments such party shall not unreasonably refuse to
incorporate into such disclosure), (b) within four business days after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall file with the SEC a Current Report on
Form 8-K to disclose this Agreement and attach a copy of the press release to
such Form 8-K, and (c) on the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to holders
of Company Common Stock, Parent shall file an amendment to such Form 8-K
attaching a copy of this Agreement (but not the Company Disclosure Schedule
or Parent Disclosure Schedule) as an exhibit to such Form 8-K amendment.  
5.10 Other Actions. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent
nor the Company shall, nor shall Parent or the Company permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, take or agree or commit to take any action that is
reasonably likely to result in any of its respective representations or
warranties hereunder being untrue in any material respect or in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in
this Agreement.   5.11 Notification of Certain Matters; Governmental
Filings. Parent and the Company, as the case may be, shall confer on a
regular basis with each other, report on operational matters and promptly
advise each other orally and in writing of any change or event constituting
or which could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. The Company
agrees to give prompt notice to Parent of, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (a) the occurrence or
failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) or 6.2(b); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Parent agrees to give
prompt notice to the Company of, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the occurrence or
failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur,    75    of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would
be reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b); provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Parent and
the Company shall promptly provide each other (or their respective counsel)
copies of all filings made by such party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or
any other state or federal Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   5.12 Conveyance
Taxes. Parent and the Company will (a) cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales,
use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time,
(b) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any applicable
exemptions to any such Tax or fee, and (c) each pay any such Tax or fee which
becomes payable by it on or before the Effective Time.   5.13 Plan of
Reorganization and Certain Tax Matters.   (a) Parent and the Company
represent and agree:   (i) Parent and the Company shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Integrated Transaction to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and before
or after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company shall knowingly
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could
cause the Integrated Transaction to fail to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.   (ii) Parent and the Company shall comply with
the record keeping and information reporting requirements set forth in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3.   (iii) This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and an integrated plan within the meaning of
Rev. Rul. 2001-46.   (iv) In connection with the delivery by Thompson and
Knight LLP, Tax counsel to the Company (or, if Thompson and Knight LLP is not
able to deliver such opinion, such other legal counsel that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company), of the opinion of counsel pursuant to Section
6.1(c), officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and
deliver to Thompson and Knight LLP or such other legal counsel certificates
substantially in the form agreed to by the parties and such law firm at such
time or times as may reasonably be requested by such law firm, including
prior to the Effective Time (which certificates shall not, without the
consent of the party delivering the certificate, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, cover matters in addition to those set forth in this
Section 5.13 (or cover such matters more broadly than this Section 5.13) with
respect to such party).    76     (v) The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other fees and similar
Taxes that become payable in connection with the Integrated Transaction that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. Each
of Merger Sub and the Company shall pay, without deduction from any amount
payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without reimbursement from the
other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any governmental entity
that becomes payable in connection with the Integrated Transaction
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax imposed on the holders of
Company Common Stock).   (b) Parent and Merger Sub represent, with respect
to themselves and their Subsidiaries, and agree that:   (i) The Merger and
the LLC Sub Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement, and there are no other written or oral agreements relating to the
Merger or the LLC Sub Merger other than those expressly referred to in this
Agreement.   (ii) The Merger and the LLC Sub Merger are a part of
an integrated plan for Parent to acquire the assets of the Company. The
parties intend that, provided the continuity of interest requirement set
forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) is met, the Merger and the
LLC Sub Merger will together be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as
if parent had directly acquired the Company\'s assets through a "statutory
merger" as that term is used in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.   (iii)
Following the Integrated Transaction, Parent, LLC Sub or one or more members
of Parent\'s "qualified group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will either continue the historic businesses or use a
significant portion of the Company\'s assets in a business within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).   (iv) In connection with the
Merger, no shares of Company Common Stock have been acquired or will be
acquired by Parent or a Parent Related Person for consideration other than
shares of Parent Common Stock other than (A) the Cash Consideration, (B) cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock paid pursuant to Section
2.6, (C) consideration paid to holders of Appraisal Shares pursuant to
Section 262 and (D) amounts payable pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement. Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or
intention to adopt such a plan other than a stock repurchase program that
complies with Rev. Rul. 99-58.   (v) Neither Parent nor any Parent Related
Person will in connection with the Merger purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of the Parent Common Stock that is issued in the Merger other
than any fractional share for which Parent or any such related person pays
cash as part of the Merger or other than in open market purchases of Parent
Common Stock that are described in Rev. Rul. 99-58.    77     (vi) The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to
Parent of issuing fractional shares and is not separately bargained for
consideration.   (vii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will, when the Merger
occurs, be an "investment company," within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code, and will not at that time be under the jurisdiction
of a court in a title 11 or similar case, within the meaning of Section
368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.   (viii) There is no intercorporate indebtedness
existing between Parent and the Company that was issued, acquired or will be
settled at a discount.   (ix) None of the compensation received by
any shareholder-employees of the Company will be separate consideration for,
or allocable to, any of their shares of Company Common Stock; none of the
shares of Parent Common Stock received by any shareholder-employees will be
separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement; and
the compensation paid to any shareholder-employees of the Company who
continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger and
LLC Sub Merger will be for services actually rendered and will not exceed
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm\'s length for similar
services.   (x) The assumption of liabilities of the Company pursuant to
the Merger and LLC Sub Merger is for a bona fide business purpose and the
principal purpose of the assumption is not the avoidance of federal income
tax on the transfer of assets of the Company to LLC Sub pursuant to the
Merger and the LLC Sub Merger.   (xi) No liabilities of any person other
than the Company will be assumed by LLC Sub in the Merger and the LLC Sub
Merger, and none of the shares of Company Common Stock to be surrendered in
exchange for Parent Common Stock in the Merger will be subject to any
liabilities.   (xii) Parent and Merger Sub will each pay their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.  
(xiii) Neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person owns, nor has it owned
during the past year, any shares of stock of the Company. Neither Parent nor
any Parent Related Person has caused any other person or entity to acquire
stock of the Company on behalf of Parent or any Parent Related Person, and
will not directly or indirectly acquire any stock of the Company
in connection with the Merger, except as described in this Agreement.  
(xiv) Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or
property to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by
the Company) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not
made any loan to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly
by the Company) in anticipation of the Merger.   (xv) Merger Sub is a
Delaware corporation wholly and directly owned by Parent and has been newly
formed solely to consummate the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will have no assets other than cash to satisfy capital requirements under
state    78    law, and has not, and will not, conduct any business
activities or other operations of any kind other than the issuance of its
stock to Parent or as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement.  
(xvi) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will not have or issue any warrants,
options, convertible securities or any other type of right pursuant to which
any person or entity could acquire any stock in Merger Sub.   (xvii) Parent
has no plan or intention to liquidate or merge the Company or LLC Sub with or
into another corporation (other than the merger of the Company with and into
LLC Sub pursuant to the LLC Sub Merger) or to sell or otherwise dispose of
any of the assets of the Company, except for (A) dispositions made in the
ordinary course of business, (B) sales to a person or entity other than a
Subsidiary of Parent or (C) transfers described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of
the Code or Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k).   (xviii) Parent is
paying no consideration for the shares of the Company Common Stock other than
(A) the Merger Consideration, (B) amounts paid in respect of Appraisal Shares
pursuant to Section 262 and (C) any amounts payable pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement.   (xix) No stock or securities of Parent will
be issued for any indebtedness owed to any Company stockholder in connection
with the Merger.   (xx) No stock of Merger Sub will be issued to any person
or entity other than Parent in connection with the Merger.   (xxi) After
the Effective Time, and at all times prior to and as of the effective time of
the LLC Sub Merger (the "Second Effective Time"), Parent will be a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of Delaware. Subject to the accuracy of the representations made by
the Company in Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, after the Effective Time,
and at all times prior to the Second Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Delaware.   (xxii) After the Effective Time,
and at all times prior to the Second Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation\'s issued and outstanding capital stock will consist solely of
10,000 shares of common stock, all of which will be owned directly by
Parent.   (xxiii) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to
the Second Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not dispose of any
assets held by the Surviving Corporation.   (xxiv) After the Effective
Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will not incur any additional liabilities, other than liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business.    79     (xxv) After the
Effective Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective Time, there
will be no indebtedness existing between the Surviving Corporation and
Parent.   (xxvi) After the Second Effective Time, LLC Sub will not
transfer any of the assets of the Surviving Corporation except for (A)
dispositions made in the ordinary course of business, (B) sales to a person
or entity other than a Subsidiary of Parent or (C) transfers described in
Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(k)..   (xxvii) No stock or securities of Parent issued in
connection with the Merger will be issued to any Company stockholder for
services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
(except to the extent of outstanding Company Options described in Section 5.6
and Company Restricted Stock).   (xxviii) For federal tax purposes, LLC Sub
is classified as disregarded as an entity separate from Parent in accordance
with Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 and neither Parent nor LLC Sub
has any plan or intention to change the classification of LLC Sub as a
disregarded entity for federal tax purposes.   For purposes of this Section
5.13(b), a "Parent Related Person" with respect to Parent or Merger Sub shall
mean:   (i) a corporation that, immediately before or immediately after
a purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition of Parent Common
Stock, is a member of an Affiliated Group (as defined herein) of which Parent
(or any successor corporation) is a member, or   (ii) a corporation in
which Parent (or any successor corporation), owns, or which owns with respect
to Parent (or any successor corporation), directly or indirectly, immediately
before or immediately after such purchase, exchange, redemption, or other
acquisition, at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote or at least 50% of the total value of shares of all
classes of stock, taking into account for purposes of this clause (ii) any
stock owned by 5% or greater stockholders of Parent (or any successor) or
such corporation, a proportionate share of the stock owned by entities in
which Parent (or any successor) or such corporation owns an interest, and any
stock which may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of options.   (c) The
Company represents, with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries, and agrees
that:   (i) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement and the Company is not a party to any other written or
oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to
in this Agreement.   (ii) The Merger and the LLC Sub Merger are part of an
integrated plan for Parent to acquire the assets of the Company. The parties
intend that, provided the continuity of interest requirement set forth in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) is met, the Merger and the LLC Sub
Merger will be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as if Parent
had    80   directly acquired the Company\'s assets through a "statutory
merger" as that term in used in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.   (iii)
Neither the Company nor any Company Related Person has redeemed or acquired
any Parent Common Stock or any Company Common Stock since September 23, 2005,
or otherwise in connection with the Merger.   (iv) The Company has not made
any distribution with respect to Company Common Stock since September 23,
2005, or otherwise in connection with the Merger.   (v) The liabilities of
the Company assumed by LLC Sub and the liabilities to which the transferred
assets of the Company are subject were incurred by the Company in the
ordinary course of its business.   (vi) There is no intercorporate
indebtedness existing between Parent and the Company that was issued,
acquired or will be settled at a discount.   (vii) The fair market value
and the federal income tax basis of the assets of the Company to be
transferred to LLC Sub in the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger will equal or
exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by LLC Sub, plus the amount of
liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.   (viii)
None of the compensation received by any shareholder-employees of the Company
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of
Company Common Stock; none of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by
any shareholder-employees will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any employment agreement; and the compensation paid to any shareholder-
employees of the Company who continue as employees of the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger will be for services
actually rendered and will not exceed amounts paid to third parties
bargaining at arm\'s length for similar services.   (ix) The payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger is solely for the
purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional
shares and is not separately bargained for consideration.   (x) The Company
will not, when the Merger occurs, be an "investment company," within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F) of the Code, and will not at that time be
under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case, within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.   (xi) The assumption of
liabilities of the Company pursuant to the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger is
for a bona fide business purpose and the principal purpose of the assumption
is not the avoidance of federal income tax on the transfer of assets of the
Company to LLC Sub pursuant to the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger.   (xii)
No liabilities of any person other than the Company will be assumed by LLC
Sub in the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger, and none of the shares of   
81    Company Common Stock to be surrendered in exchange for Parent Common
Stock in the Merger will be subject to any liabilities.   (xiii) The
Company and Company stockholders will each pay their respective expenses, if
any, incurred in connection with the Merger.   (xiv) No debt of the Company
is guaranteed by any Company stockholder.   (xv) The Company owns no Parent
Common Stock.   (xvi) No assets of the Company have been sold, transferred
or otherwise disposed of which would prevent Parent and the Surviving
Corporation from continuing the historic business of the Company or from
using a significant portion of the Company\'s historic business assets in a
business following the Integrated Transaction, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).   (xvii) The fair market value of the assets
of the Company transferred to Merger Sub in the Integrated Transaction will
equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed or paid by Parent or
Merger Sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred
assets are subject.   (xviii) The total adjusted basis of the assets of the
Company transferred to Merger Sub in the Integrated Transaction will equal or
exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed or paid by Parent or Merger Sub,
plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are
subject.   (xix) The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in
a title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
Code.   (xx) No stock or securities of the Company will be issued to
any Company stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of
Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company in connection with the Merger (except to
the extent of outstanding Company Options described in Section 5.6 and
Company Restricted Stock).   (xxi) No stock or securities of Parent or of
the Company will be issued to any Company stockholder for any indebtedness
owed to any Company stockholder in connection with the Merger.   (xxii) No
assets were transferred to the Company, nor did the Company assume any
liabilities, in anticipation of the Merger.   (xxiii) At one or more times
during the five-year period leading up to and ending as of the Effective Time
of the Merger, the Company was a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.   
82     (xxiv) At the Effective Time, except as contemplated by
Section 3.1(b)(i), the Company will not have outstanding any warrants,
options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which
any person or entity could acquire stock in the Company.   For purposes of
this Section 5.13(c), a "Company Related Person" with respect to the Company
shall mean:   (x) a corporation that, immediately before or immediately
after a purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition of the Company
Common Stock, is a member of an Affiliated Group (as defined herein) of which
the Company (or any successor corporation) is a member, or   (y) a
corporation in which the Company (or any successor corporation), owns, or
which owns with respect to the Company (or any successor
corporation), directly or indirectly, immediately before or immediately after
the relevant purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition, at least
50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to
vote or at least 50% of the total value of shares of all classes of stock,
taking into account for purposes of this clause (ii) any stock owned by 5% or
greater stockholders of the Company (or any successor) or such corporation, a
proportionate share of the stock owned by entities in which the Company (or
any successor) or such corporation owns an interest, and any stock which may
be acquired pursuant to the exercise of options.   For purposes of Section
5.13(b) and (c), "Affiliated Group" shall mean one or more chains of
corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent
corporation, but only if:   (aa) the common parent owns directly stock that
possesses at least 80% of the total voting power, and has a value at least
equal to 80% of the total value, of the stock in at least one of the other
corporations, and   (bb) stock possessing at least 80% of the total voting
power, and having a value at least equal to 80% of the total value, of the
stock in each corporation (except the common parent) is owned directly by one
or more of the other corporations.   For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "stock" does not include any stock that (a) is not entitled to
vote, (b) is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate
in corporate growth to any significant extent, (c) has redemption and
liquidation rights that do not exceed the issue price of such stock (except
for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium), and (d) is not
convertible into another class of stock.   (d) In no event will the
aggregate Liquidated Damages (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement) that are paid in cash and other damages that are paid in cash
under the Registration Rights Agreement and under this Agreement exceed an
amount that would prevent the Merger from satisfying the continuity of
interest requirement under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e). Such
continuity of interest determination shall be made by the Tax counsel
that delivered the opinion of counsel described in Section 6.1(c) of this
Agreement or such other Tax counsel as may be selected by Parent in its
reasonable discretion. To the extent that Liquidated Damages and such other
damages cannot be paid in cash, they will be paid in shares of Parent Common
Stock using the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Registration   
83    Rights Agreement) on the dates they accrue. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Company does not receive the opinion of counsel described
in Section 6.1(c) of this Agreement, then this Section 5.13(d) shall not
apply and shall have no effect.   5.14 Financing. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, Parent\'s financing sources,
and Parent\'s auditors and attorneys in connection with Parent\'s financing
efforts with respect to the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall provide, and the Company shall instruct its
auditors to provide, to Parent such financial and other information that
Parent reasonably requests for inclusion in any materials, including offering
materials for the issuance of debt securities, to be used by Parent in
connection with such financing. In addition, the Company shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, use its best efforts to cause the Company\'s
auditors to provide the consent of such auditors to the inclusion of any
financial statements of the Company in any such materials used by Parent.  
5.15 Resignations. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain
the resignation, effective as of a time no later than the Effective Time, of
each of its and its Subsidiaries\' officers, directors and limited liability
company managers, including those persons whose names are listed on Schedule
3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from all such positions such
persons hold with the Company and each such Subsidiary, including offices,
board positions and committee positions (but not including any person\'s
employment with the Company or any such Subsidiaries).   5.16 Hedge
Transactions. The Company has entered into the transactions set forth on
Schedule 3.1(x) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Hedge Transactions"), each of which is subject to either the ISDA Master
Agreement dated as of August 12, 2005 between the Company and BNP Paribas or
the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of February 23, 2006 between the Company
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ("JPMorgan"). The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly cause BNP Paribas and
JPMorgan to enter into a Novation Agreement with the Company, on terms
acceptable to Parent, pursuant to which all rights, liabilities, duties and
obligations of BNP Paribas under and in respect of each Hedge Transaction
entered into between the Company and BNP Paribas will be transferred to
JPMorgan by novation, effective as of prior to the Closing. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Hedge Transactions
outstanding between the Company and JPMorgan at the Closing to terminate no
later than the close of business on the Closing Date.   5.17 Sparling Stock
Voting Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the signature of Donald P. Sparling to the Stock Voting Agreement as
soon as practicable after the date hereof and shall, once obtained, furnish
the Stock Voting Agreement executed by Donald P. Sparling and the Company to
Parent.    84     ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   6.1 Conditions
to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective obligation
of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction prior
to the Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a) Company Stockholder
Approval. The Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.   (b) No
Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger
shall have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or any other
Governmental Entity and shall remain in effect, and no federal, state, local,
municipal, foreign or other law, statute, rule, regulation or decree
that makes consummation of the Merger illegal shall have been enacted,
adopted or deemed applicable to the Merger and shall remain in effect.  
(c) Opinion of Counsel. The Company shall have received the opinion
of Thompson and Knight LLP, counsel to the Company (or, if Thompson and Knight
LLP is not able to deliver such opinion, such other legal counsel that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company dated as of the Closing Date, rendered on the
basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion and
the certificates obtained from officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company, all of which are consistent with the state of facts existing as of
the Effective Time, as applicable, to the effect that (i) the Integrated
Transaction will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) the Company and Parent will each be a "party to
the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. In
rendering the opinion described in this Section 6.1(c), Thompson and Knight LLP
(or such other legal counsel) shall have received and may rely upon the
representations and agreements referred to in Section 5.13, provided,
however, that this Section 6.1(c) shall not be a condition to Closing if the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is to be paid as Merger
Consideration, after giving effect to clause (y) of Section 2.1(b), is less
than the number required in order for the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger to
satisfy the continuity of interest requirement under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e) (provided that the determination of whether the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that are to be paid as Merger Consideration,
after giving effect to clause (y) of Section 2.1(b), is sufficient in order
for the Merger and the LLC Sub Merger to satisfy such requirement must be
made by no later than five business days after the date that the Stockholder
Approval is obtained and if such determination is not made on or before such
time this Section 6.1(c) shall not be a condition to Closing).   6.2
Conditions of Obligations of Parent. The obligations of Parent to effect the
Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, any or
all of which may be waived in whole or in part by Parent:   (a)
Representations and Warranties of the Company. Each of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such
representations and    85    warranties speak as of an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall remain true and correct
as of such earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of
the Closing Date except for inaccuracies of representations or warranties the
circumstances giving rise to which or the effects of which, individually or
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect (provided that, in determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties for purposes of this Section 6.2(a), all
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and materiality qualifications contained in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded), and Parent shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to such

deemed to mean the average of the daily closing prices for the shares of
Parent Common Stock for the fifteen consecutive full trading days on which
such shares are actually traded on the NYSE (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source selected
by Parent) ending at the close of trading on the fifth trading day prior to
the date written notice of termination of this Agreement is delivered by the
party electing to terminate this Agreement), plus (2) an amount equal to the
difference of (a) the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are subject to Company Options that are outstanding on the
business day immediately preceding the date of termination of this Agreement,
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Cash Value, minus (b) the aggregate exercise
price for all of such Company Options (the "Termination Fee"). If the
Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to subsection (b)(i) of this
Section 7.2 in connection with a termination by Parent, the Termination
Fee shall be paid in same-day funds no later than one business day after the
date written notice of termination of this Agreement is delivered by Parent
to the Company. If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to
subsection (b)(i) of this Section 7.2 in connection with a termination by the
Company or pursuant to subsection (b)(ii) of this Section 7.2, the
Termination Fee shall be paid in same-day funds concurrently with the
delivery of the notice of termination, and as a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of any termination, of this Agreement.   (c) If (i) Parent or
the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), (ii)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) other than under
the circumstances described in any of clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section
7.1(f), or (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) and, at the time of such termination, Parent is entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or 7.1(f), and, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal has not been proposed
to the Company or otherwise publicly announced or communicated to the holders
of Company Common Stock, then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal
to the product of (A) 0.30 multiplied by (B) the Termination Fee, with such
payment to be made, if the termination is    91    by the Company, in
same-day funds concurrently with the delivery of the notice of termination,
and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any termination, of this
Agreement or, if the termination is by Parent, in same-day funds no later
than one business day after the date written notice of termination of this
Agreement is delivered by Parent to the Company; provided that, if the
Company shall consummate an Acquisition Proposal within twelve months of the
date of such termination, then the Company shall pay, in addition to the
amount described above in this sentence, an amount equal to the balance of
the Termination Fee in same-day funds at or prior to the date of
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.   (d) The parties hereto
acknowledge that the agreements contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any fee payable
by it pursuant to this Section 7.2, then the Company shall pay to Parent
Parent\'s costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with
collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the
rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points from the date such payment was due under
this Agreement until the date of payment. The fees payable by the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be paid by the Company without reservation
of rights or protests, and the Company upon making any such payment shall be
deemed to have released and waived any and all claims that it may have to
recover such amounts.   (e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall
constitute or shall be deemed to constitute liquidated damages for the breach
by the Company of the terms of this Agreement or otherwise limit the rights
of Parent.   7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval,
but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   7.4 Extension;

the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas and the Federal
courts of the United States sitting in Tarrant County, and any appellate
court from any such state or Federal court, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to any such claim may be
heard and determined in such Texas court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such Federal court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in
this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to
bring any claim relating to this Agreement or any related matter against any
other party or its assets or properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.   Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any related matter in any Texas state or Federal court located in Tarrant
County and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
claim in any such court.    95     8.10 Severability. If any term or
other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under any
rule of applicable law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein
are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.   8.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)

preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   8.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to this Agreement to
perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise to comply with such obligations, including its failure to take all
actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Merger, will
cause irreparable injury to the other parties to this Agreement for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
of the parties hereto consents to, in addition to any other remedies which
may be available, the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of any party\'s obligations, including an
injunction to prevent breaches, and to the granting by any such court of the
remedy of specific performance of the terms and conditions hereof, without
the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages.   8.13 Schedule
Definitions. All capitalized terms in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein,
