### then all remaining disputed items shall be submitted for resolution to

the disputed items within 30 Business Days after such submission, and such
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm arising under

in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted. Any subsequent adjustments to the sum of the Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities shall be reflected in the Allocation in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder.
 For all Tax purposes, the Purchaser and the Seller agree that
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall be reported in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the Allocation,
and that none of them will take any position inconsistent therewith in any
Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise (and the
Seller shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing). The Seller
and the Purchaser agree to cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form
8594, and to furnish the other with a copy of such Form prepared in draft
form within a reasonable period before its filing due date.

required to keep such information confidential. The Seller agrees and
acknowledges that remedies at law for any breach of its obligations under

consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement which the
Purchaser in its sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the
Purchaser or the Purchased Business.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, in the event that any
consent, approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the
Purchased Business any right or benefit under any lease, license,
contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement (as it relates to the
Purchased Business) to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party
is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Seller will, subsequent to the
Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such consent,
approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such
consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, the Seller shall use

benefits, the Purchaser shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.

of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage,
operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or other assistance to
or participate in or be connected with, as an officer, employee, partner,
stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any Person that competes with the
Purchased Distribution Centers in the Covered Territory; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, for the purposes of this Section 5.06, ownership
of securities having no more than five percent of the outstanding voting
power of any competitor which are listed on any national securities exchange
shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Section 5.06 as long as the
Person owning such securities has no other connection or relationship with
such competitor; and _provided_ , _further_ that this Section 5.06(a) shall
not apply to any retail food or non-food business owned or operated by the

stock of the Seller, or any Affiliate of the Seller that directly or
indirectly participates in the conduct of the Purchased Business, or (2) all
or substantially all of the assets of the Seller or of any of such Affiliates
from engaging in the Covered Business in the Covered Territory, provided that
such purchaser shall not use any of the assets or employees of the Seller or
any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date, including any Confidential
Information, to engage in the Covered Business in the Covered Territories for
the remainder of the Restricted Period. The provisions of this Section 5.06(a)
shall not apply following a change of control of the Seller, as such term is
defined in Section 5.06(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

### (b) As a separate and independent covenant, the Seller agrees with the
Purchaser that, during the Restricted Period, the Seller will not, and will
cause its agents, representatives, employees, officers and directors (for so
long as they are such) not to, in any way, directly or indirectly, for
the purpose of conducting or engaging in any business that distributes,
supplies or sells products of the kind distributed, supplied or sold by the
Purchased Business as of the Closing Date: (i) call upon, solicit, advise or
otherwise do, or attempt to do, or assist any third party to do or attempt to
do, business with any customers of the Purchased Business other than the
Chicago Customers (as defined below), or take away or interfere or attempt to
interfere with any custom, trade, business or patronage of the customers of
the Purchased Business; or (ii) call upon or solicit, or assist any third
party to call upon or solicit any customers of the Purchased Business that

reduce the volume of its business with the Purchaser or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , that this subparagraph (ii) shall not preclude the Seller or any
of its Affiliates from acquiring (by whatever means, including asset
acquisition, stock acquisition, merger or otherwise) any unrelated third
party wholesale supplier that, at the time of such acquisition, has a
supplier relationship with any of the Chicago Customers (a " _Pre-Existing
Chicago Supply Relationship_ "), or from succeeding to, continuing and
expanding such Pre-Existing Chicago Supply Relationship; or (iii) interfere
with or attempt to interfere with any officers, employees, representatives or
agents of the Purchased

### Business or induce or attempt to induce any of them to leave the employ
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates or violate the terms of their contracts,
or any employment arrangements, with the Purchaser or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not prohibit a general
solicitation to the public or general advertising or the hiring by the Seller
or any of its Affiliates of any such person after such person has terminated
his or her employment with the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Section 5.06(b) shall not apply to any retail food or non-food business
owned or operated by the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Seller acknowledges that the covenants of the Seller set forth in
this Section 5.06 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for the agreement of the Seller to comply with these covenants, the Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement. The Seller acknowledges that this
Section 5.06 constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be affected
by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by
the Purchaser. The Seller has independently consulted with its counsel and,
after such consultation, agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section
5.06 are reasonable and proper.

  

###

Purchaser as of the Closing.

  



  

SECTION 5.09. _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax

for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to
or furnishing information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase any
part of the Purchased Assets or the Purchased Business from the Purchaser.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules,
related work papers and documents in their possession relating to rulings or
other determinations by Tax authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
make themselves (and their respective employees) available on a basis
mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents
or information provided under this Section 5.09.  Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the Purchased Assets or the
Purchased Business for each

taxable period first ending after the Closing and for all prior
taxable periods for a period equal to the lesser of five years or until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except
to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for
the respective Tax periods. In the event that any party desires to retain
any such documents or other information which is in the possession of the
other party, the requesting party shall give the other party written notice
indicating the documents to be retained at least 90 days prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.  Any information obtained under this Section
5.09 shall be kept confidential in accordance with Section 5.03, except as
may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

hold the Purchaser harmless against any Conveyance Taxes which become payable

The Seller, after the review and consent by the Purchaser, shall file
such applications and documents as shall permit any such Conveyance Tax to
be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser shall execute and deliver
all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Seller to comply
with the foregoing and, with respect to any licensed or titled vehicles that
are included in the Purchased Assets, shall take title to such vehicles in a
subsidiary that holds such motor carrier licenses or permits as may be
appropriate to enable the Seller to qualify for exemptions from Conveyance
Taxes applicable to such vehicles.

  



  

SECTION 5.11. _Further Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, such reasonable efforts on the part of the
Purchaser shall include those relating to all actions reasonably required
under its Credit Agreement to cause the condition set forth in Section
7.02(e)(ii) to be fulfilled.

  



  

SECTION 5.12. _Risk of Loss_. (a) The risk of loss or damage by fire or
other casualty to any Real Property before delivery of the applicable deed
or assignment is assumed by the Seller. In the event that any Real Property
shall suffer any fire or casualty or any injury, subject to Sections 7.02 and
9.01, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the Seller
agrees to (i) repair the damage at its sole cost and expense before the date
set for delivery of the deed or assignment, as applicable, hereunder, or (ii)
make an appropriate reduction in the Purchase Price based on a reasonable
approximation of the cost of such repair as agreed by the parties, or (iii)

casualty or injury.

  



  

### (b) The risk of loss or damage to the Real Property by condemnation
before delivery of the applicable deed or assignment is assumed by the
Seller. In the event any condemnation proceeding is commenced, subject to
Sections 7.02 and 9.01, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect,
and the Seller shall assign to the Purchaser at the Closing all of the
SellerÂ’s right, title and interest in and to all awards made in respect of
such condemnation and

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

### shall pay over to the Purchaser all amounts theretofore received by the
Seller in connection with such condemnation.

  

### 

  

SECTION 5.13. _Proration of Certain Charges_. (a)  Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all installments of special assessments or other
charges on or with respect to the Purchased Assets payable by the Seller for
any period in which the Closing shall occur, including, without limitation,
base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all municipal, utility or
authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas charges, garbage or waste
removal, and cost of fuel, shall be apportioned as of the Closing and each
party shall pay its proportionate share promptly upon the receipt of any
bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such charges or rates
are assessed either based upon time or for a specified period, such charges
or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 a.m., central standard time, on the
Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed based upon usage of
utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter
readings taken on the Closing Date.

  



  

### (b) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional
rent, license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to
the extent attributable to the operation of the Purchased Business for any
period in which the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Seller
shall be entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any
period before the Closing Date, and if the Purchaser or the Seller, as
the case may be, shall receive any such payments after the Closing Date, it
shall promptly remit to the other party its share of such payments.

  

### 

  

### (c) The prorations pursuant to this Section 5.13 may be calculated after
the Closing, as each item to be prorated (including without limitation any
such obligation, assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment,
fee or revenue) accrues or comes due, _provided_ that, in any event, any such
proration shall be calculated not later than 30 days after the party
requesting proration of any item obtains the information required
to calculate such proration.

  

### 

  

SECTION 5.14. _Cooperation_. (a)  From the date hereof, in connection with
the PurchaserÂ’s financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Seller will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser, at the PurchaserÂ’s
cost, including (i) providing the financial institutions engaged by the
Purchaser and participating in financing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement all material information (financial and other) with respect to
the Purchased Business, the Purchased Assets and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement reasonably requested by the Purchaser as may
be necessary for the Purchaser to obtain the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter; and (ii) cause the SellerÂ’s chief financial officer, its
treasurer, members of the chief financial officerÂ’s staff, and the manager of
the Purchased Business, as well as SellerÂ’s accountants, to be reasonably
available (which may, at their option, be by telephone), to financial
institutions engaged by the Purchaser and participating in the financing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the PurchaserÂ’s counsel and
the PurchaserÂ’s accountants to participate in due diligence sessions as may
reasonably be necessary for the Purchaser to obtain the financing and any
audit or legal opinions customary therewith necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that the Purchaser
will use reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of time that the SellerÂ’s
officers and employees are required to devote to the activities

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

described in this Section 5.14(a), so that such activities do not detract
materially from the ongoing performance of such personsÂ’ regular duties and
responsibilities to the Seller.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof, the Seller shall cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel to
assist the Purchaser and its officers, employees, agents, accountants,
counsel, financing sources and representatives in the preparation on a timely
basis of any financial statements in respect of the Purchased Business
prepared in compliance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, the Purchaser may be required to include in any filing with any
Governmental Authority following the Closing Date.  All the reasonable
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Seller in
connection with complying with this Section 5.14(b) shall be borne by the
Purchaser.

  



  

SECTION 5.15. _Transitional Use of Seller Â’s Name_. The Seller hereby grants
to the Purchaser, for a period of 90 days following the Closing, a non-
exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the trademarks
"RoundyÂ’s" and "Old Time" (the " _Seller Â’s Marks_") to the extent necessary
to operate the Purchased Business without interruption, including on
vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationary, packaging materials,
displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms and computer software.
As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 90 days
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall remove, strike over or otherwise
obliterate all of SellerÂ’s Marks from the Purchased Assets, including, but
not limited to, all of the foregoing items. During the 90 days following the
Closing, the Purchaser shall have a right to sell off existing inventory of
products manufactured or packaged by or for the Purchased Business which may
bear any of the SellerÂ’s Marks, provided that the Purchaser shall sell such
products to retail supermarkets or other stores similar to the type
customarily supplied by the Seller prior to the date hereof. Any use of the
SellerÂ’s Marks by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall be in
conformity with the practices of the Seller as of the date of Closing
and shall be in a manner that does not in any way harm or disparage the

# EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  

# 

  

SECTION 6.01. _Offer of Employment_. (a) As of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment to all Covered
Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who are
employed by the Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date
(including all such Covered Employees on inactive status, e.g. employees who
are on layoff, short-term disability, receiving workersÂ’ compensation
benefits or are on other approved leave with a right to reemployment).
Any such Covered Employee on inactive employment status with the Seller or
any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date shall remain on inactive status
with the Purchaser and have such recall or reemployment rights as are
provided for by the applicable collective bargaining agreement or otherwise
required by Law.

  



  

(b) As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall
offer employment to all Covered Employees who are not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement (" _Non-Union Covered Employees_ ") and who are actively
employed by the Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date
(including such Covered Employees who are on vacation or are receiving
workersÂ’ compensation benefits while actively employed with the Seller). The
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment to any Non-Union
Covered Employee who is not actively employed by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date because such Non-Union Covered Employee is
out on short-term disability, receiving workersÂ’ compensation benefits or is
on other approved leave with a statutory right to reemployment (such as
Family and Medical Leave Act leave) as of the date such Non-Union Covered
Employee returns to active employment, provided that (x) such Non-Union
Covered Employee returns to active employment within 90 days of the Closing
Date (however, such 90-day time limitation shall not apply if a Non-Union
Covered Employee otherwise has continuing statutory reemployment rights) and
(y) the Purchaser or its Affiliate offering employment has a position
available for which such Non-Union Covered Employee is qualified or such Non-
Union Covered Employee has statutory rights of reemployment. As used herein, "
_Transferred Employee_ " shall mean each such Covered Employee who accepts
such offer under Section 6.01 (a) or (b). Nothing contained in this Section
6.01 shall obligate or commit the Purchaser to continue to employ
any Transferred Employee after the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 6.02. _Assumption of Collective Bargaining Agreements_. As of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall assume the
collective bargaining agreements listed on Section 3.23 of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Labor Agreements_ "). The Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates shall recognize and give full credit to each of the Transferred
Employees covered by the Labor Agreements (the " _Transferred Union
Employees_ ") for service and seniority with or recognized by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates to the extent required by the applicable
Labor Agreement. The cessation of employment of the Transferred Union
Employees with the Seller or any of its Affiliates and their subsequent
employment with the Purchaser or one its Affiliates shall not be deemed by
the Purchaser to be a break in service or seniority for purposes of the Labor
Agreements. The Purchaser and the relevant Affiliates shall recognize the

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

layoff status and current seniority status of Covered Employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement who are on layoff status as of the Closing
Date.

  



  

SECTION 6.03. _Provision of Benefits_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.03, as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall be
covered by the employee benefit plans, programs and policies established or
maintained by the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Â’s Plans_"). As of the Closing
Date, Transferred Employees (the " _Lima Transferred Employees_ ") covered by
the Warehouse Agreement or Drivers Agreement between Scot Lad-Lima, Inc. a
Division of RoundyÂ’s, Inc. and Truck Drivers Warehousemen and Helpers Union,
Local 908 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs,
Warehousemen and Helpers of America (the " _Lima Collective Bargaining
Agreements_ ") shall be covered under the Central States Southeast and
Southwest Areas Pension Fund (the " _Multiemployer Pension Plan_ ") and the
Ohio Conference of Teamsters Health and Welfare Plan VI (" _OCTVI_ ").
 Without limiting in any respect the obligation of the Purchaser to assume
and comply with the Labor Agreements, nothing contained in this Section 6.03
shall obligate or commit the Purchaser to continue the PurchaserÂ’s
Plans after the Closing Date or to maintain in effect any particular plans or
any level or type of benefits.

  



  

SECTION 6.04. _Assumption of Midland 401(k) Plan_. As of the Closing Date,
the Seller shall cause The Midland Grocery Company to transfer the
sponsorship of the Assumed 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser and the Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates shall assume from The Midland Grocery Company the
sponsorship of the Assumed 401(k) Plan and the duties and obligations of The
Midland Grocery Company as the sponsor of the Assumed 401(k) Plan. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Seller shall take any action necessary to permit the
Assumed 401(k) Plan to be adopted by the Purchaser. The Seller shall make,
or shall cause The Midland Grocery Company to make, matching contributions
under the Assumed 401(k) Plan with respect to all amounts deferred under the
Assumed 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date by Transferred Employees who
participate in the Assumed 401(k) Plan.

  



  

SECTION 6.05. _Withdrawal Liability_. Purchaser agrees to comply with the
requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA so that no complete withdrawal (as
defined in Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial withdrawal (as defined in
Section 4205 of ERISA) by the Seller from the Multiemployer Pension Plan will
occur by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In order
to comply with Section 4204 of ERISA with respect to the Multiemployer
Pension Plan, the Seller and the Purchaser hereby agree that (i) the
Purchaser shall make contributions to the Multiemployer Pension Plan for
substantially the same number of "contribution base units" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(11) of ERISA) with respect to the Purchased Business for
which the Seller had an obligation to contribute to the Multiemployer Pension
Plan and (ii) the Seller and the Purchaser shall use their best efforts to
obtain an exemption or variance from the requirements of Sections
4204(a)(1)(B) and (C) of ERISA, but if no such exemption or variance can be
obtained, (x) the Purchaser shall post a bond or provide an amount in escrow
that satisfies the requirements of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA and (y) if
the Purchaser withdraws from the Multiemployer Pension Plan in a complete
withdrawal or a partial withdrawal before the last day of the fifth plan year
beginning after the Closing Date, and the withdrawal liability of
the Purchaser with respect to the Multiemployer Pension Plan is not paid,
the Seller shall be secondarily liable to the Multiemployer Pension Plan for
any withdrawal 

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

liability the Seller would have had to the Multiemployer Pension Plan but for
Section 4204 of ERISA.

  



  

SECTION 6.06. _WARN_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing any
notice required pursuant to Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act
with respect to any layoff or plant closing relating to the Purchased
Business that occurs as a result of or after the Closing. The Seller shall
be responsible for providing any such notice with respect to a layoff or
plant closing occurring prior to the Closing.  The Seller agrees to provide
to the Purchaser at Closing a list of all employees of the Purchased
Business, or otherwise employed at any facility to be transferred to the
Purchaser, that have been laid off or otherwise terminated by Seller or any
of its Affiliates during the 90 days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 6.07. _Multiemployer Plan Obligations_. The Seller shall remain
liable for all contributions that were required to be made to the OCTVI and
the Multiemployer Pension Plan for the benefit of the Lima Transferred
Employees prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 6.08. _Personnel Files_. The Seller and its Affiliates shall provide
the Purchaser with copies of the personnel files of all Transferred
Employees, but, to the extent required by the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
or any applicable state laws protecting the privacy of medical records, shall
have no obligation to disclose or transfer to the Purchaser medical records
of any Transferred Employee unless the Seller receives a
written authorization from the Transferred Employee authorizing the Seller or
any of its Affiliates to release such records.  The Seller agrees to
cooperate with the Purchaser in PurchaserÂ’s efforts to obtain any required
consent from Transferred Employees.

arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section 8.02(i) or

may give rise to a claim for Loss under this Article VII, within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from

Indemnified Party within fifteen days of the receipt of such notice from the

Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party.  In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the
right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession or under the Indemnified
PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is

### reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event
the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s
possession or under the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may
be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.06. _Tax Treatment_. The Seller and the Purchaser agree that all
payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other party
hereto under this Article VII, under other indemnity provisions of this
Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or
covenants shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to
the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in
which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify
the relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

  



  

SECTION 8.07. _Provisions Regarding Environmental Remediation_. In the event
that a Remedial Action is required by any Environmental Law, any Governmental
Authority or as a result of any Third Party Claim in connection with an
Environmental Liability subject to the indemnification set forth in Section
8.02(i), the Seller shall perform the Remedial Action. In each case
concerning any particular Real Property that is either Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property (any such parcel, the " _Subject Property_ "):

  



  

### (a) Subject to the Seller complying with the provisions of this Section
8.07(a), the Seller, and those Persons acting on behalf of the Seller, may,
prior to the Remedial Action Approval Date, enter upon and use the
Subject Property, at reasonable times and with reasonable prior notice,
including use of roads and driveways, solely for the purpose of performing
the Remedial Action. " _Remedial Action Approval Date_ " means the date that
either (A) a "No Further Action" letter or other document issued by the
applicable Governmental Authority indicating that no additional Remedial
Action need be performed with respect to the environmental condition in
question, or (B) in the circumstance where no Governmental Authority is
involved, a document issued by a reputable environmental engineer, approved
by both the Seller and the Purchaser, indicating that, in such environmental
engineerÂ’s opinion, no additional Remedial Action need be performed with
respect to the environmental condition in question so as to protect health,
safety or the environment (the document described in either clause (A) or (B)
immediately preceding, a " _Remedial Action Approva_ l"), such Remedial
Action Approval being satisfactory to the Purchaser, is delivered to the
Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Seller shall perform the Remedial Action at the Subject Property
in compliance with all Laws, including Environmental Laws, and in such a
manner as to minimize, to the extent practicable, damage to the Subject
Property (including to the improvements, fixtures and appurtenances thereon)
and the disruption of or interference with the PurchaserÂ’s use of the Subject
Property (including the improvements, fixtures and appurtenances thereon).
The Purchaser shall not use the Subject Property in such a manner as would
exacerbate the condition that is subject to the Remedial Action.

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

### (c) The Seller shall be responsible for the cost of any repairs,
replacements or damages to the improvements, fixtures and appurtenances
within the Subject Property to the extent caused by the act or omission of
the Seller or caused by any Remedial Action performed by or on behalf of the
Seller.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Seller may connect to any utility lines which serve the Subject
Property, in order to provide water, electric, telephone, sanitary sewer,
storm sewer and other utility services to the Seller in connection with the
Remedial Action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Seller shall obtain all
necessary utility approvals and permits prior to making any connections; and
_provided_ _further_  that the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all
costs and expenses which the Purchaser incurs as a result of the SellerÂ’s use
of such utilities.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Seller shall provide copies to the Purchaser of all draft and
final correspondence, workplans and reports relating to the Remedial Action,
whether prepared by or on behalf of the Seller or received by or on behalf of
the Seller, and, with respect to any correspondence, workplans or reports
that the Seller contemplates submitting to any Governmental Authority, prior
to such submittal, the Seller shall give the Purchaser adequate time for
review and approval of all such documents. The Purchaser may, at its own
expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor the Remedial Action, including any fieldwork performed by or on
behalf of the Seller, and the Seller shall promptly and in good faith provide
the Purchaser (and those acting on behalf of the Purchaser) access to the
worksite and the results of such fieldwork.

SECTION 10.03. _Public Announcements_. Except for disclosures by the Seller to
its lenders and investors, neither party hereto shall make, or cause to be
made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any

otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, and the
parties hereto shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such
press release, public announcement or communication.

  



  

SECTION 10.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law
or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the

contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the

59   

     
   

  



  

SECTION 10.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of
the Seller or the Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Purchaser
or the Seller may assign this Agreement or any of their respective rights and
obligations hereunder to one or more of their respective Affiliates and (ii)
Purchaser may grant a security interest in its rights hereunder to its
creditors, in each case, without the consent of the other party,  _provided_
that the Purchaser and the Seller shall remain liable for all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of,

the Purchaser would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of

that any breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser could not be
adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly,
in addition to any other right or remedy to which the Purchaser may be
entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce any provision
of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking.

hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Minnesota or Wisconsin
state or federal court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in

PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.12.**

  



  

SECTION 10.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
