whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules, as applicable. The information set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely

 _SECTION 2.6_   _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities,
subject to _Section 2.7_ and _Section 2.8_:

  



  

(a)  All issued and outstanding limited liability company
interests of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, and such share shall constitute the only outstanding
share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock held by the
Original Stockholders shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, which shall be paid in Buyer Common Stock and
cash. The per share cash consideration payable to the Original Stockholders
shall equal (i) the Available Cash, _plus_ the Adjusted Aggregate Exercise

Consideration_ "). The Buyer Common Stock consideration payable to the

shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration,  _less_ the Per Share Cash Consideration, if any, _divided by_
(ii) $10 (the " _Per Share Equity Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Per Share Cash Consideration payable to each Original
Stockholder and RSU Holder that makes an election pursuant to _Section
2.6(d)_ or _Section 2.8(f)_, as applicable, and the Option Cash
Consideration payable to each Optionholder that makes an election pursuant to
_Section 2.8(f)_, shall be decreased, in each case, by the percentage of the
Per Share Merger Consideration that such Original Stockholder, RSU Holder or
Optionholder elected to receive in additional shares of Buyer Common Stock,
and the aggregate amount of all additional cash available to the Original
Stockholders, RSU Holders and Optionholders as a result of such elections
shall increase the Per Share Cash Consideration payable to each
Original Stockholder, RSU Holder and Optionholder that did not make such an
election, pro rata based on the ownership of the Adjusted Aggregate Shares
held by all Original Stockholders, RSU Holders and Optionholders that did not
make such elections. The Per Share Equity Consideration payable to each
Original Stockholder, RSU Holder and Optionholder that does not make the
election described in the preceding sentence shall be decreased to reflect
the increase in the Per Share Cash Consideration described in the preceding
sentence.

  



  

(c)  Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock held by

(d)  Notwithstanding _Section 2.6(b)_, any Original Stockholder
that is or was an Optionholder or RSU Holder may, by written notice to Buyer
at any time prior to (i) the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the
SEC, in the case of the Optionholders and RSU Holders set forth on _Schedule
2.6(d)_, and (ii) fifteen (15) calendar days following the initial filing of

Consideration that it would otherwise receive pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_
with respect to the shares of Common Stock received upon exercise of its
Options or settlement of its RSUs prior to the Closing (and as a result
receive a corresponding increase in the Per Share Equity Consideration as
calculated pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ equivalent to such reduced Per Share
Cash Consideration amount).

  



  

As of the Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any shares of Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive consideration described above in this _Section 2.6_, in accordance
with _Section 2.8_, without interest.

  



  

 _SECTION 2.7_   _Exchange of Common Stock_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall deposit with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or such other
bank or trust company as may be designated by Buyer and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in
accordance with this _Section 2.7_, through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
2.6_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide the Exchange
Agent with the cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_ as of
the Closing (such shares of Buyer Common Stock and cash, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Buyer shall
assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock.
Buyer shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the
Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares and to pay any cash consideration payable at or
after the Closing. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures_. At least one (1) Business Day prior
to the Closing, the Company will deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) a duly
executed letter of transmittal in the form set forth on _Exhibit D_ from each
Stockholder, including Levy Newco and Levy Newco II (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) any physical certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") that represent outstanding shares of Common Stock held by
such Stockholder, in each case, to the extent received by the Company at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing. Upon the surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, together with a
Certificate, if any, representing the shares of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Company or the Exchange Agent, the
Stockholder that surrendered such documents shall be entitled after the
Effective Time to receive, in exchange for the shares of Common Stock held by
such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
(together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) and other
cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
Merger, and any shares of Common Stock so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until such time as a certificate representing Buyer Common Stock is
issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered Letter of
Transmittal and Certificate, if any, such Buyer Common Stock shall be deemed
not outstanding and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.7_, any shares of Common
Stock held by a Stockholder and each Certificate representing any shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the consideration
contemplated by _Section 2.6_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Letter of Transmittal or Certificate. Each
certificate representing Buyer Common Stock that is issued in the Merger
shall have the legend set forth below:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE " _ACT_ "), OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE
OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT AND SAID LAWS OR AN
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS THEREOF."

  



  

(c)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
uncertificated Common Stock or any Certificate formerly representing Common
Stock with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.6_, until the surrender by such
Stockholder to the Exchange Agent of the Letter of Transmittal and such
Certificate, if any, in accordance with this _Section 2.7_. Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Letter of Transmittal and
Certificate, if any, there shall be paid to the holder of such shares of
Common Stock surrendered thereby in respect of the whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.6_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock.

  



  

(d)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The
consideration issued (and paid) in the Merger in accordance with the terms of
_Section 2.6_ and this _Section 2.7_ shall be deemed to have been issued
(and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of Common
Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior
to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time,
and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.7_.

(e)   _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Buyer Common
Stock shall be issued pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
holder of Buyer Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 2.7(e)_, all
fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be
aggregated. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Common Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled
to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to
the _product_ of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share
of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled under _Section
2.6_ and (B) $10. The Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts,
without interest, after the Effective Time to the holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive such cash upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed, together with a Certificate, if any,
representing the shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Company or the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(f)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Common Stock or Warrants
who has not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.7_ shall thereafter
look only to Buyer for payment of its claim for consideration for its Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger.

  



  

(g)   _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Buyer Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Letter of
Transmittal and Certificate, if any, in respect of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time has not been surrendered
prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the consideration contemplated by _Section 2.6_ or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock as contemplated
by  _Section 2.7_ in respect of such Letter of Transmittal and Certificate,
if any, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Body), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Letter of Transmittal and Certificate, if any, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h)   _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer, on a
daily basis; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody's Investors Service or Standard and
Poor's, respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments

(i)   _Withholding Rights_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

 _SECTION 2.8_   _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)  In accordance with the terms of the Del Taco Holdings, Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to
cause all unvested Options to become fully vested on the Stock Purchase
Closing Date immediately following the purchase of Common Stock by Levy Newco
and Levy Newco II from the Company and immediately prior to the purchase of
Common Stock by Levy Newco and Levy Newco II from the Stockholders, (ii) use
its best efforts to cause all vested Options to be exercised on the Stock
Purchase Closing Date immediately following the purchase of Common Stock by
Levy Newco and Levy Newco II from the Company and immediately prior to the
purchase of Common Stock by Levy Newco and Levy Newco II from the
Stockholders, and (iii) take all actions necessary to cause each Option that
remains outstanding as of the Closing to be converted into the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Common Stock underlying such Option,
the Per Share Option Consideration, which shall be paid in Buyer Common Stock
and cash (the aggregate amount payable in respect of Options pursuant to this
_Section 2.8(a)_, the " _Option Amount_ "), in each case, _less_ required
withholding Taxes.

  



  

(b)  The portion of the Per Share Option Consideration payable in
cash in respect of each Option held by an Optionholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall equal (i) the Per Share Option Consideration
_multiplied by_ (ii) the  _quotient_ of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration
_divided by_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such cash amount the "
_Option Cash Consideration_ "). The portion of the Per Share Option
Consideration payable in Buyer Common Stock in respect of each Option held by
an Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be a number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to (1) the Per Share Option Consideration
_less_ the Option Cash Consideration, _divided by_ (2) $10.

  



  

(c)  In accordance with the terms of the Del Taco Holdings, Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to
cause all unvested RSUs to become fully vested on the Stock Purchase Closing
Date immediately following the purchase of Common Stock by Levy Newco and
Levy Newco II from the Company and immediately prior to the purchase of Common
Stock by Levy Newco and Levy Newco II from the Stockholders, (ii) use its
best efforts to cause each RSU to be settled on the Stock Purchase Closing
Date immediately following the purchase of Common Stock by Levy Newco and Levy
Newco II from the Company and immediately prior to the purchase of Common
Stock by Levy Newco and Levy Newco II from the Stockholders and (iii) take all
actions necessary to cause each RSU that remains outstanding as of the
Closing to be settled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger
Consideration, which shall be paid in Buyer Common Stock and cash in the same
proportions as payable to the Original Stockholders under _Section 2.6(b)_
(the aggregate amount payable in respect of RSUs pursuant to this _Section
2.8(c)_, the " _RSU Settlement Amount_ "), in each case, _less_ required
withholding Taxes.

(d)  The cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the
Optionholders and the RSU Holders shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation
through payroll processing and distribution at the next administratively
practicable payroll date following the Closing to each Optionholder and RSU
Holder (less required withholding Taxes). All disbursements to each
Optionholder or RSU Holder shall be made only after delivery by such
Optionholder or RSU Holder of an equity award payment letter in
substantially the form attached as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Equity Award Payment
Letter_ ") and such other documents, in each case, as reasonably satisfactory
to the Company. Buyer and the Company shall establish procedures to enable
each Optionholder and RSU Holder to deliver an Equity Award Payment Letter
prior to the Closing and to receive cash payment for the shares of
Common Stock underlying the Options or RSUs covered thereby that were
outstanding at the Effective Time at the next administratively
practicable payroll date following the Closing or, if the Equity Award
Payment Letter is delivered after the Closing, at the next
administratively practicable payroll date following the delivery thereof.

  



  

(e)  Each Optionholder and RSU Holder shall be entitled after the
Effective Time to receive, in exchange for the shares of Common Stock
underlying the Options or RSUs held by such Optionholder or RSU Holder at the
Effective Time, a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock that such Optionholder or RSU Holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this  _Section 2.8_. No fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the Optionholder or RSU Holder
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Buyer Common Stock. In lieu
of fractional shares, the Optionholder shall be entitled to a payment
calculated in the same manner as applies to a holder of Common Stock under
_Section 2.7(e)_ and added to the cash portion of the merger
consideration payable to the Optionholder or RSU Holder in accordance with
this _Section 2.8_.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding _Section 2.8(b)_ or _2.8(c)_ , any
Optionholder or RSU Holder may, by written notice to Buyer at any time prior
to (i) the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, in the case of
the Optionholders and RSU Holder set forth on _Schedule 2.6(d)_, and (ii)
fifteen (15) calendar days following the initial filing of the Proxy
Statement with the SEC, in the case of each other Optionholder and RSU Holder,
elect to reduce (but not below zero) the Option Cash Consideration (in the
case of an Optionholder) or the Per Share Cash Consideration (in the case of
an RSU Holder) that it would otherwise receive (and as a result receive a
corresponding increase in the Buyer Common Stock that it receives pursuant to
the Merger as calculated pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ or _2.8(c)_ , as
applicable, equivalent to such reduced cash amount).

  



  

 _SECTION 2.9_   _Warrants_. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, all Warrant Holders shall exchange all of their Warrants
for Common Stock at or prior to the Closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

directors' and officers' liability insurance policy to the current policy for

more insurers with an A.M. Best rating no less than the A.M. Best rating of
the current insurer for the Company and its Subsidiaries, with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Closing and having coverage limits in
the same aggregate amount as currently provided for a six (6)-year period
following the Merger Closing Date. The costs of the DandO Tail shall be borne by

Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Proxy

Date under the Company's vacation and sick leave policies as in effect
immediately prior to the Merger Closing Date, and (ii) allow each of the
Transferred Employees to use such accrued vacation and sick leave days at such
times as each would have been allowed under the Company's vacation and sick
leave policies as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Closing Date.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Surviving
Corporation shall timely pay or cause to be paid all sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of
any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the Transactions.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.2_   _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section
9.1_, each party to this Agreement shall bear its respective fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions (including legal,
accounting, financial advisor and other professional fees, collectively, "
_Transaction Expenses_ "), _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall
pay and be solely responsible for the Approved Transaction Expenses.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.3_   _Entire Agreement_ . This Agreement (including
the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, and each
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or to
be executed in connection with the Transactions, represent the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements among
the parties respecting the Transactions. The parties hereto have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the other agreements, documents, instruments
and certificates contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any of the agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates contemplated hereby.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.4_   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement can be
amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived,
only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed
by Buyer and the Company; _provided_  that the observance of any provision of
this Agreement may be waived in writing by the party that will lose the
benefit of such provision as a result of such waiver; _provided_ , _further_
, that, after receipt of the Stockholder Written Consent, if any such
amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law require further approval of the
Stockholders, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject
to the approval of the Stockholders; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
_Sections 5.7_,  _5.11_ , _5.13_ , _5.15_ , _5.16_ and _9.14_ , each of
which provisions is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to
therein and may be enforced by any such Person, and any related defined terms,
may not be amended without the prior written consent of such Persons. No
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on
behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power
or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, this _Section 9.4_ and _Sections 9.5_, _9.6(b)_ , _9.9_
and _9.11_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification or supplementation of such provision would modify the substance
of such Sections) may not be amended, modified or supplemented in a manner
that adversely affects the rights of the Debt Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 _SECTION 9.5_   _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement of this
Agreement, including all claims (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any claim, suit controversy, dispute, action or
proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, to which any of the Debt Financing Sources is a party arising out
of, or in any way relating to, the Transactions contemplated hereby,
including to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Credit
Agreement Amendment, shall be governed by, and constructed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.6_   _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

  



  

(a)  Any litigation against any party to this Agreement arising
out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (unless the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware located in New Castle County) (together with the appellate
courts thereof, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and each of the parties hereby
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of
any such litigation. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to
assert (i) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of
any such litigation in any Chosen Court, (ii) any claim that any such
litigation brought in any Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum and (iii) any claim that any Chosen Court does not have jurisdiction
with respect to such litigation. To the extent that service of process by
mail is permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process in any such litigation in such courts by the mailing of
such process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party
at its address for notices provided for herein.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not bring
or support any claim, suit, action, proceeding, cross-claim or third-party
claim against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Credit Agreement
Amendment or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any state or
federal court of competent jurisdiction within the State of New York located
in New York County, and any appellate court thereof, and each of the parties
hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and (ii) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which such party may have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such claim, suit, action or proceeding in any such court.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, each party hereto agrees
that none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation
to any party hereto relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions
contemplated hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, it being understood and agreed that nothing herein shall limit the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' rights and the Debt Financing
Sources' obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement
Amendment.

 _SECTION 9.8_   _Severability_. If any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
Law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.9_   _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party
Beneficiaries_ . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as contemplated by _Section 2.6_ (with respect to the Stockholders'
and the Warrant Holders' rights to receive the merger consideration described
therein),  _Section 2.8_ (with respect to the Optionholders' right to
receive the Option Amount and the RSU Holders' right to receive the RSU
Settlement Amount), and _Sections 5.7_, _5.11_ , _5.13_ , _5.15_ , _5.16_ , 
_9.4_ and _9.14_ (each of which provisions is intended to be for the benefit
of the Persons referred to therein and may be enforced by any such Person),
and except for rights of the Debt Financing Sources, each of which is an
intended third party beneficiary of the rights set forth in _Sections 9.4_,
_9.5_ , _9.6(b)_ , this _Section 9.9_ and _Section 9.11_ , nothing in this
Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the
right to enforce the rights of the Original Stockholders, the Warrant
Holders, the Optionholders and the RSU Holders to pursue damages in the event
of Buyer's or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party,
directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment without the required consents shall be void.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.10_   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy
of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. A signature delivered by facsimile or
by electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance thereof shall be deemed to be an original signature.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.11_   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, including any
Proceeding involving the Debt Financing Sources, any Company Documents, any
Buyer Documents, any Merger Sub Documents or any Transaction. Each party
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the Company Documents, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.11_.

 _SECTION 9.12_   _Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions, to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of any other party, in the Chosen Courts, and
appropriate injunctive relief (including any Order sought by the Company to
cause Buyer to perform its covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement) may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Each of
the parties hereto hereby waives: (i) any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate;
and (ii) any requirement to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

 _SECTION 9.13_   _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company
acknowledges that Buyer is a blank check company with the powers and
privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar
business combination involving Buyer and one or more businesses or assets (a
" _Business Combination_ "). The Company further acknowledges that, as
described in the prospectus dated November 13, 2013 (the " _Prospectus_ ")
available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of Buyer's assets consist of the
cash proceeds of Buyer's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in the
Trust Account for the benefit of Buyer, certain of its public stockholders
and the underwriters of Buyer's initial public offering. As described in the
Prospectus, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account that may be released to Buyer to pay its franchise and income
tax obligations, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to
Buyer in limited amounts from time to time in order to permit Buyer to pay
its operating expenses; (ii) if Buyer completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, as defined in the Prospectus, then to
those Persons and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; and (iii) if
Buyer fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time
period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Buyer
in limited amounts to permit Buyer to pay the costs and expenses of its
liquidation and dissolution, and then to Buyer's public stockholders (as such
term is defined in the agreement governing the Trust Account). For and in
consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company, on behalf of itself
and its directors, officers, Affiliates and stockholders, hereby irrevocable
waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have or may have
in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and agree not to seek
recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a
result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with Buyer; _provided_ that (x) nothing herein shall serve to
limit or prohibit the Company's right to pursue a claim against Buyer for
legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account or
for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (including a claim for Buyer to specifically
perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the
balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to
the Buyer Stockholder Redemption) to the Sellers in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not
affect Buyer's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Buyer
Stockholder Redemption, and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit any claims that the Company may have in the future against Buyer's
assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds
that have been released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been
purchased or acquired with any such funds).

 _SECTION 9.14_   _Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a)  In any dispute or Proceeding arising after the Closing under
or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other agreements
contemplated hereby, the parties agree that any of the Original Stockholders,
the Optionholders, the RSU Holders or the Warrant Holders shall have the
right, at its election, to retain the firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") to represent such Original Stockholder,
Warrant Holder, Optionholder, or RSU Holder in such matter, and Buyer and the
Company (on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and representatives and their respective successors and
assigns) hereby irrevocably waive and consent to any such representation in
any such matter.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties further agrees that all communications
among Fried Frank, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and any Original
Stockholder, Warrant Holder, Optionholder or RSU Holder related to this
Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby, together with
the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all
other rights to any evidentiary privilege, belong to such Original
Stockholder, Warrant Holder, Optionholder, or RSU Holder, as applicable,
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Company or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(c)  If the Transactions are consummated, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have no right of access to or control over any of Fried
Frank's records related to such transactions, which shall become the property
of (and be controlled by) the Original Stockholders, the Warrant Holders, the
Optionholders, or the RSU Holders, as applicable, and (ii) it would be
impracticable to remove from the records (including emails and other
electronic files) of the Company and its Subsidiaries any privileged
communications with or among Fried Frank, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
and any Original Stockholder, Warrant Holder, Optionholder or RSU Holder. The
Company, its Subsidiaries, Buyer and Merger Sub agree not to access, review or
otherwise use, examine or rely upon such privileged communications that may
remain in the records of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the parties
agree that no attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or other
privilege or protection is waived or intended to be waived by allowing such
material to remain in the files of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(d)  Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between any Original
Stockholders, Warrant Holders, Optionholders or RSU Holders, on the one hand,
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, arising out of
or relating to any matter in which Fried Frank acted for them both, none of
the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any
other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to the
Original Stockholders, the Warrant Holders, the Optionholders or the RSU
Holders, as applicable, any information or documents developed or shared
during the course of Fried Frank's joint representation of the Original
Stockholders, the Warrant Holders, the Optionholders and the RSU Holders and
the Company and its Subsidiaries.
