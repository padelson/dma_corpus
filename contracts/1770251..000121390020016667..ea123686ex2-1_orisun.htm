ARTICLE XI 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

11.1  _Indemnification of the Purchaser_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article XI and from and after the Closing Date, the Principal
Shareholders (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") hereby jointly and severally
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser (the " _Indemnified Party_
"), against and in respect of any and all out-of-pocket loss, cost, payment,
demand, penalty, forfeiture, expense, liability, judgment, deficiency or
damage, and diminution in value or claim (including actual costs of
investigation and attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses) (all of the
foregoing collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with any breach,
inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and
covenants of the Company contained herein.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for Fraud Claims against the Company,
(i) the Indemnified Party shall not assert any claim, and shall not
be entitled to indemnification, unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Losses indemnifiable hereunder exceeds an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the "
_Threshold_ "), in which event the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
the aggregate amount of all Losses from the first dollar, regardless of the
Threshold, and (ii) any liability incurred pursuant to the terms of this
Article XI shall be paid exclusively from the Escrow Shares valued at the then
market value per share and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

11.2  _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by
the Indemnified Party for indemnification:

  



  

(a) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt notice
(an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party action with respect to
which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.1 or
11.2 (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in reasonable detail
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The
failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights
or benefits of such Indemnified Party under Sections 11.1 or 11.2, except to
the extent such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the
Indemnifying Parties to defend such claim or increases the amount of such
liability.

  



  

(b) In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is
sought by the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Parties, to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim
unless the Indemnifying Parties, within a reasonable time after the giving of
an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party (but in any event within
ten (10) days thereafter), shall (i) deliver a written confirmation to such
Indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of Sections 11.1 or 11.2
are applicable to such action and the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify
such Indemnified Party in respect of such action pursuant to the terms of
Sections 11.1 or 11.2 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall do
so without asserting any challenge, defense, limitation on the Indemnifying
Parties liability for Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii) notify such
Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Indemnifying Parties to
assume the defense thereof, and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third-
Party Claim.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in connection
with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept
fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel with
respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and
in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Indemnified Party shall not pay,
or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such
asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or fail to
vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a
judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the
Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately
prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the
Indemnified Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties) shall be
entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that
part of any Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third-
Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than the amount as to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e) If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Sections 11.1 and 11.2 and proposes to settle the same
prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto,
then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written
notice thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or
prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The
Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment
with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than
the payment of money damages is or may be sought against the Indemnified
Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be reasonably expected to
impose or create a monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party
(such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income Tax) other than the
monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid
pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii) which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting
such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such Third-
Party Claim and all other actions (known or unknown) arising or which might
arise out of the same facts.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(f)  Following the Closing, the disinterested independent directors of the
Purchaser shall have the authority to institute and prosecute any claims for
indemnification hereunder in good faith on behalf of the Purchaser to enforce
the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

11.3  _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Shareholders_. The Company, the Principal
Stockholders and the Shareholders' Representative hereby authorize the
Purchaser to issue the Escrow Shares to the Escrow Agent to hold in escrow
(the " _Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(a)  _Escrow Shares; Payment of Dividends; Voting_. Any dividends, interest
payments, or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the Escrow
Shares will be delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow.
The Shareholders shall be entitled to vote the Escrow Shares on any matters
to come before the shareholders of the Purchaser.

  



  

(b)  _Distribution of Escrow Shares_. At the times provided for in Section
11.3(d), the Escrow Shares shall be released and transferred by the Escrow
Agent to the Shareholders' Representative for distribution to the
Shareholders. The Purchaser will take such action as may be necessary to
cause such securities to be issued in the names of the appropriate persons.
Certificates representing Escrow Shares so issued that are subject to resale
restrictions under applicable securities laws will bear a legend to that
effect. No fractional shares shall be released and delivered from the Escrow
Fund to the Shareholders' Representative and all fractional shares shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(c)  _Assignability_. No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest therein may
be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law, by
the Shareholders or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the Shareholders, prior to the
transfer and delivery to such Shareholders by the Shareholders'
Representative of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

  



  

(d)  _Release from Escrow Fund_. Within five (5) business days following
expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "), the Escrow Shares
will be released from escrow to the Shareholders' Representative less the
number or amount of Escrow Shares (valued at the then market value per share)
equal to the amount of any potential Losses set forth in any
Indemnification Notice from the Purchaser with respect to any pending but
unresolved claim for indemnification. Prior to the Release Date,
the Shareholders' Representative shall issue to the Escrow Agent a
certificate executed by him (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
instructing the Escrow Agent to release such number of Escrow Shares
determined in accordance with this Section 11.4(d). Any Escrow Shares
retained in escrow as a result of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
released and transferred to the Shareholders' Representative promptly upon
resolution of the related claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this Article XI. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any indemnification payments will be made to Purchaser or
its successors. Any Escrow Shares received by Purchaser as an indemnification
payment shall be promptly cancelled by Purchaser after its receipt thereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Fraud Claim shall not be limited by the Escrow
Fund.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

11.4  _Payment of Indemnification_. In the event that the Purchaser is
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, the Purchaser
shall be paid exclusively from the Escrow Shares.

  



  

11.5  _Insurance_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take into
account any insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement actually
received.

  



  

11.6  _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits
hereto and all certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings furnished
pursuant to this Agreement) shall survive until six(6) months following the
Closing (the " _Survival Period_ "). After the expiration of the Survival
Period, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no further liability for
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI other than with respect to the
claims already made pursuant to this Article XI.

  



  

11.7  _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this Article XI
shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Party,
from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any and all claims arising
out of or related to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

ARTICLE XII 
 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  



  

12.1  _Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) The parties shall promptly submit any dispute, claim, or controversy

enforcement of this Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any
action in tort, contract, equity, or otherwise), to binding arbitration before
one arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). Binding arbitration shall be the sole
means of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect,
validity, termination, interpretation, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any claim in tort,
contract, equity, or otherwise).

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(b) If the parties cannot agree upon the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall be

Arbitrator shall apply in rendering his decision. The Arbitrator shall issue a

within the period referred to in Section 12.1(c).

  



  

(f)  The Arbitrator may, at his discretion and at the expense of the party
who will bear the cost of the arbitration, employ experts to assist him in
his determinations.

  



  

(g) The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to
confirm any arbitration award (including actual attorneys' fees and costs),
shall be borne by the unsuccessful party and shall be awarded as part of the
Arbitrator's decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise allocate such
costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly
consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in
New York, New York to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to render any
provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or in aid of
the arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and subject
matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be
submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the parties hereto shall challenge
any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to such
arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent from such
arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have been the
subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(i) The parties shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any experts employed by
the Arbitrator and hold them harmless from and against any claim or demand
arising out of any arbitration under this Agreement, unless resulting from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the person indemnified.

ARTICLE XIII 
 TERMINATION

  



  

13.1  _Termination Without Default_.

  



  

(a) In the event that the U.S. GAAP Financial Statements have not been
delivered by August 21, 2020, the Purchaser Parties shall have the right, at
their sole option, to terminate this Agreement without liability to the
Company. Such right may be exercised by the Purchaser Parties, as the case
may be, with a written notice to the Company at any time after August 21, 2020
and prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder
has not occurred by December 31, 2021 (the " _Outside Closing Date_ ") and no
material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement shall have occurred or have been made (as provided in Section 13.2
hereof), the Purchaser Parties or the Company, as the case may be, shall have
the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Agreement without liability
to the other side. Such right may be exercised by Purchaser Parties or the
Company, as the case may be, by giving written notice to the other at any time
after the Outside Closing Date.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

13.2  _Termination Upon Default._

  



  

(a) The Purchaser Parties may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to
the Company Group on or prior to the Closing Date, without prejudice to any
rights or obligations the Purchaser Parties may have, if the Company Group
shall have materially breached any of its representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants contained herein or in any Additional Agreement to be
performed on or prior to the Closing Date or this Agreement, the Plan of
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby fail to be authorized or
approved by the shareholders of the Company and such breach shall not be cured
within fifteen (15) days following receipt by the Company Group of a notice
describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach. For avoidance of
doubt, (i) any Equity Financing below $25,000,000 pursuant to Section 9.7 or
any breach of Section 9.8 shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement, (ii) the failure to deliver the U.S. GAAP Financial Statements by
August 21, 2020 shall not constitute a material breach.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to any
Purchaser Party, without prejudice to any rights or obligations the Company
Group may have, if any Purchaser Party shall have materially breached any of
its covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties contained herein
or in any Additional Agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date
and such breach shall not be cured within fifteen (15) days following receipt
by such Purchaser Party(s) of a notice describing in reasonable detail the
nature of such breach.

  



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.2
hereof, the breaching party shall be obligated to pay the non-breaching party
a break-up fee of $3,000,000 (the " _Break-up Fee_ "), promptly after
termination of this Agreement by the non-breaching party. The Company and the
Purchaser Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Break-up Fee is a fair
and reasonable estimate of the actual damages suffered by the non-breaching
party, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, (ii) the Break-up Fee constitutes liquidated damages hereunder and
is not intended to be a penalty, and (iii) the Break-up Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to the non-breaching party against the
breaching party; provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this
Section 13.2(c)(iii) shall not apply to the liabilities arising from any
Fraud Claim against the breaching party.

  



  

13.3  _Survival_. The provisions of Article XI through Article XIII shall
survive any termination hereof.

or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not
