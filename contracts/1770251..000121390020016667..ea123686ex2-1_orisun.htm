to have their Parent Common Stock redeemed in conjunction with the stockholder vote on the Parent Stockholder Approval Matters
as defined below. The Proxy Statement shall include proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from Parent stockholders
to vote, at an extraordinary general meeting of Parent stockholders to be called and held for such purpose (the &ldquo;<U>Parent

by this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and applicable proxy solicitation and registration statement rules set forth
in Parent&rsquo;s organizational documents, Delaware Law, Cayman Law and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. The Purchaser
shall cooperate and provide the Company Group (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration

Parties with such information concerning the Company Group and its equity holders, officers, directors, employees, assets, Liabilities,

Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, which information provided by the Company Group shall be true and correct
and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made not materially misleading (subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth in the materials provided by the Company
Group). If required by applicable SEC rules or regulations, such financial information provided by the Company Group must be reviewed

necessary in order to make the statements made not materially misleading. The Purchaser will use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing

contemplated hereby.</P>
