procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the

dissolution or other incapacity of the Purchaser or the Company or any change
in the status, control or ownership of the Purchaser or the Company. This
guarantee is in addition to, without limiting and not in substitution for, any

Agreement) which may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the

limitation, disability or incapacity on or of the Purchaser or the Company (as
the case may be) or any fact or circumstance (other than any limitation
imposed by this Agreement or the relevant Transaction Document, as the case
may be) shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor and the Purchaser\'s Guarantor were the sole or
principal obligor in respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor on demand.

|

require the consent of its shareholders or of any other person.

documents filed by the Purchaser's Guarantor since the Applicable Date and
those filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments
thereto, are referred to in this sub-clause 11.5 as the "Company Reports".

or, if not yet filed, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley

extent such Company Report has been amended, modified or superseded in any
subsequent Company Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement, in which
case as of the date of such amendment, modification or superseding filing),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

Schedule 5 
(Transitional Services)

1. Transitional Service Standards 


| 
---|--- 

1.1

|

In consideration of the Purchaser agreeing to pay the charges specified in the
Schedule of Charges to Attachment 1-A, the Seller agrees to provide (or
procure the provision of) each of the Transitional Services to the Purchaser
(or, if requested by the Purchaser, to or for the benefit of the Company) for
the period and in accordance with the service descriptions and service levels
set out in Attachment 1-A to this Schedule 5 (Transitional Services) and to at
least the same volume and standard as such services were provided during the
Comparison Period (or, if not provided during the Comparison Period, using
reasonable care and skill) having regard to changes necessary as a result of
the sale of the Business and to any exclusions and conditions set out in
Attachment 1-A. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2

|

Without prejudice to any other provisions of this Agreement, the Seller agrees
to provide (or procure the provision of) any services in good faith diligently
and with reasonable care and skill ,to at least the same volume and standard
as such services were provided during the Comparison Period (or, if not
provided during the Comparison Period, using reasonable care and skill),
having regard to changes necessary as a result of the sale of the Business and
to any exclusions and conditions set out in Attachment 1-A, which satisfy all
the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs 1.2(A) to (E) ("Additional
Services"), being services which: 

(A) are not specified in Attachment 1-A but which have been provided by the
Seller (or any member of the Seller\'s Group) to the Business during the
Comparison Period;

(B) are reasonably required by the Purchaser;

(C) the provision of which has been requested in writing within the period of
three months following the Completion Date;

(D) the Seller is, at the time of such request, providing to other members of
the Seller\'s Group and is technically and operationally able to provide to
the Purchaser without causing any detriment to the ongoing operation of the
Seller\'s retained business; and

(E) which have not been explicitly excluded from the Transitional Services in
Attachment 1-A.

| 
---|--- 

1.3

|

Additional Services shall be requested and considered in accordance with the
change control procedures set out in paragraph 6 below. 

| 
---|--- 

1.4

|

Without limiting the generality of sub-paragraph 1.1 above, the Seller shall
not discriminate against or assign lower priority to the Purchaser in the
provision of the Transitional Services as compared against employees of the
Seller or other members of the Seller\'s Group who use the same services. 

| 
---|--- 

1.5

|

Notwithstanding sub-paragraph 1.1 above, the Seller shall perform the
Transitional Services in compliance with, and subject to, all applicable laws,
enactments, orders, regulations and other similar instruments. 

| 
---|--- 

1.6

|

Each Party shall comply with any obligation undertaken by it in Attachment
1-A. 


| 
---|--- 

1.7

|

The Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing and discuss with the
Purchaser before the Seller (or any member of the Seller\'s Group) removes or
replaces the Seller's Transitional Services Manager. 

| 
---|--- 

1.8

|

Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under this Agreement, if the
Seller fails to meet any service level under this Agreement in respect of any
Transitional Service for a period of: 

(A) 18 hours, in relation to any distribution service (including those
services set out in service number 4 (Customer Service and Logistics) or
service number 5 (Finance) of Attachment 1-A) or IT service (including those
services set out in service number 6 (IT) of Attachment 1-A); or

(B) seven days, in relation to any other Transitional Service,

and the Purchaser, acting reasonably, believes that such failure has had a
material adverse impact on the Business, the Purchaser and/or the Company
shall be entitled to engage a third party to provide a service equivalent to
such Transitional Service for the period of time for which, in the reasonable
opinion of the Purchaser, the relevant service level would not otherwise be
met under this Agreement. In such event, the Seller will reimburse the
Purchaser for the difference between: (a) any reasonable amounts paid by the
Purchaser to the relevant third party for the provision of such equivalent
service; and (b) the amount which would have been payable by the Purchaser to
the Seller had the Seller provided such service.

| 
---|--- 

1.9

|

If the Seller proposes to undertake any repair, upgrade, maintenance work or
other activity which is likely to interrupt or reduce the functionality of any
Transitional Service, then the Seller shall give the Purchaser reasonable
prior notice of the proposal, allow the Purchaser a reasonable period of time
in which to make representations to the Seller and consider such
representations (acting reasonably) before undertaking the proposal. In
implementing any such proposal, the Seller shall use reasonable endeavours to
minimise the disruption to the Business.

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

In consideration of the Seller providing the Transitional Services, the
Purchaser shall pay the Seller the charges for the Transitional Services set
out in Attachment 1-A. For the avoidance of doubt, the cost set out at
Attachment 1-A for the provision of each Transitional Service does not include
any amount in respect of VAT that may be chargeable thereon. To the extent
that the provision of any Transitional Service is a supply on which VAT is
chargeable, sub-clause 3.3 of the Business Purchase Agreement shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

The Seller has made the Purchaser aware of all material third party costs in
relation to the Transitional Services of which it is aware having made all
reasonable and diligent enquiries and such costs are contained within the
Schedule of Charges. The Seller shall use reasonable endeavours to provide the
Transitional Services without incurring third party costs other than those:
(i) expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Schedule of Charges; or
(ii) otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties but in the event that third
party costs (other than those: (i) expressly provided for in this Agreement;
or (ii) otherwise agreed 



in writing by the Parties) are to be incurred in relation to the provision of
the Transitional Services, the Purchaser shall elect either: (i) not to
require the Seller to provide the relevant Transitional Service (in which case
the Seller shall have no obligation to provide, and shall have no liability
for any failure to provide such Transitional Service); or (ii) bear such third
party costs equally with the Seller in relation to the provision of such
Transitional Service.

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Without prejudice to sub-paragraph 2.1 above, the Seller shall be responsible
for any costs incurred by it in relation to the provision of electronic data
relating to the Business from the Seller\'s IT and related systems in
accordance with Attachment 1-A in order to facilitate the termination of any
Transitional Service. Such data shall be provided to the Purchaser in the
standard output format of the relevant system. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Purchaser requires the electronic data to be provided in another format,
the Seller shall arrange for such reformatting at the Purchaser's cost (such
costs to be subject to the Purchaser\'s prior approval). 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Unless specified otherwise in Attachment 1-A, in respect of the charges
relating to Transitional Services, the Seller shall invoice the Purchaser on
an Accounting Period basis in arrear. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Each invoice issued in respect of Transitional Services shall specify to a
reasonable level of detail: 

(A) what each element of the charges on the invoice relates to, and how the
sums have been calculated; and

(B) the Taxes, disbursements or other expenses included within the invoice
(and any relevant rates).

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

All undisputed invoices properly issued by the Seller in respect of the
Transitional Services are payable in full by the Purchaser within 30 days of
receipt of the invoice, in cleared funds to the bank account nominated in
writing by the Seller. Where the Purchaser (acting reasonably and in good
faith) disputes a particular Transitional Services invoice, it shall notify
the Seller of the dispute as soon as is reasonably practicable following
receipt of the invoice, and such dispute shall then be resolved in accordance
with the procedure described in paragraph 11 below. Notwithstanding the
dispute, the Purchaser shall make payments against any undisputed elements of
the invoice within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. Upon resolution of the
dispute, the Purchaser shall pay any sums agreed, pursuant to the procedure
described in paragraph 11 below, to be payable by the Purchaser within 5
Business Days of such agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

Clause 19 (Default Interest) of the Business Purchase Agreement shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, to invoices relating to Transitional Services. 

| 
---|--- 

2.8

|

Upon termination or expiry of a Transitional Service, the Seller shall invoice
the Purchaser for all amounts due or payable to the Seller in respect of such
Transitional Service which was provided in the period prior to termination and
which have not yet been invoiced. Such invoice is to be paid in accordance
with sub-paragraph 2.6 above. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Consents 


| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

The Seller shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain and maintain any consents
licences, sub-licences or approvals necessary from third parties in order to
provide the Transitional Services ("TSA Third Party Consents") and the Seller
confirms that it has no reason to believe that any such TSA Third Party
Consents will not be obtained. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

Save to the extent that any failure to obtain or maintain a TSA Third Party
Consent is attributable to a failure or delay by the Seller to comply with its
obligations under sub-paragraph 3.1 above (in which case any resulting costs
shall be for the account of the Seller), the costs of obtaining and
maintaining TSA Third Party Consents shall be taken into account in the
charges for the Transitional Services and, if any costs and expenses are
incurred in connection with obtaining or maintaining TSA Third Party Consents
in addition to the costs so taken into account in the charges for the
Transitional Services, including costs that may be incurred by any agent,
contractor or sub-contractor of the Seller (a "Third Party Provider"), which
are outside the ordinary course of business, or could not have been reasonably
anticipated by Premier (having made all reasonable enquiries), at the date of
this Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall bear such third party costs
equally, provided that: 

(A) the Seller shall at all times use reasonable endeavours to minimise such
costs, using reasonable endeavours to negotiate with Third Party Providers to
minimise or waive any such costs; and

(B) prior to incurring any such cost with a Third Party Provider, the Seller
shall seek the Purchaser's written consent to such costs.

| 
---|--- 

3.3

|

Save to the extent that any failure to obtain or maintain a TSA Third Party
Consent is attributable to a failure or delay by the Seller to comply with its
obligations under sub-paragraph 3.1 above, the Seller shall have no obligation
to provide, and shall have no liability for any failure to provide or delay in
providing, Transitional Services for which a TSA Third Party Consent is
necessary but is not obtained or is refused, terminated or withdrawn. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

records and assistance as the other may reasonably request for the purpose of
preparing for, performing or receiving any Transitional Services and shall,
and shall procure that its contractors, agents and employees shall, comply
with their respective obligations under all applicable laws in the provision

Seller nor the Purchaser shall have a right to request information for the
sole or primary purpose of validating the suitability or effectiveness of the
other Party's systems and procedures.

4.2

directors, employees, contractors, sub-contractors, agents or other
representatives.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Transitional Services Liability Limitations and Exclusions 

The following provisions shall describe each Party\'s liability in respect of
the Transitional Services and the other matters described in this Schedule 5

other or to any member of the Purchaser's Group or the Seller's Group (as
appropriate) whether in contract, tort (including negligence and breach of

arise in connection with the Transitional Services and the other matters
described in this Schedule 5 (Transitional Services).

paid in respect of the relevant Transitional Service in the six months prior
to the date of the relevant claim; or (b) in the event of a claim in the first
six months of the duration of the relevant Transitional Service sums not yet
paid but which would be payable in accordance with paragraph 2 above if the
relevant Transitional Service had subsisted for the full first six months of
its duration, as specified in the Schedule of Charges at Attachment 1-A.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Termination of Transitional Services 


| 
---|--- 

10.1

Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 5
(Transitional Services): (i) each Rolling Service shall terminate at 11.59
p.m. on the first anniversary of the Completion Date; and (ii) each Fixed Term
Service shall terminate on the "Fixed termination date" assigned to such Fixed
Term Service in the Schedule of Charges in Attachment 1-A. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Subject to sub-paragraph 10.3, the Purchaser may terminate all or any of the
Rolling Services without cause, by giving the period of notice specified in
the Schedule of Charges in Attachment 1-A for the relevant Rolling Service,
provided that such period of notice does not expire before the date which
falls one calendar month after the Completion Date. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

The Rolling Services set out in sections 4 (Customer Service and Logistics), 5
(Finance) with the exception of 5.1(C), 6 (IT) and 9 (Project Management) are
linked and may not be terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to sub-paragraph
10.2 unless all of the aforementioned Rolling Services are terminated on the
same date. However, the Seller agrees that the Purchaser may terminate
sections 4 (Customer Service and Logistics) and 5 (Finance) sections 5.1(B),

a Change Notice (as described in paragraph 6 above).

The Seller may terminate all or any of the Transitional Services immediately
by notice in writing to the Purchaser if the Purchaser (i) fails to pay the
cost associated with the Transitional Services when due; or (ii) otherwise

within 30 days of receipt of written notice setting out reasonable details of
the same; or

(B) immediately with written notice to the other Party if the other Party is
unable to pay its debts or enters into compulsory or voluntary liquidation
(other than for the purpose of effecting a reconstruction or amalgamation in
such manner that the company resulting from such reconstruction or
amalgamation if a different legal entity shall agree to be bound by and assume
the obligations of the relevant Party under this Agreement) or compounds with
or convenes a meeting of its creditors or has a receiver or manager or an
administrator appointed of its assets or ceases for any reason to carry on
business or takes or suffers any similar action which in the reasonable
opinion of the Party giving notice means that the other may be unable to pay
its debts.

Any termination of any Transitional Service shall be subject to sub-paragraph
2.6 above. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7

|

Without prejudice to sub-paragraph 1.1 above, the Seller agrees, following
termination of any Transitional Service other than pursuant to sub-paragraph

services equivalent to the Transitional Services, in place thereof, prior to
the termination of that Transitional Service.

terminate under sub-paragraph 10.5, any reasonable cost incurred by the Seller
pursuant to sub-paragraph 10.7 above shall be borne by the Purchaser and
included in the next invoice sent to the Purchaser following the cost having
been incurred or a separate invoice in the event that no further invoices are
due in respect of such Transitional Service.

Transitional Services Disputes 

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

If a dispute or difference arises between the Parties out of or in connection
with any Transitional Service or other matter covered by this Schedule 5
(Transitional Services), the Parties shall seek to resolve such dispute or
difference through the following procedure: 

(A) at the written request of either Party, the resolution of a dispute or
difference shall be escalated for good faith consideration to the Seller's
Transitional Services Manager, on behalf of the Seller, and Robert Argyl, on
behalf of the Purchaser (or their respective designees as notified to the
other Party in writing); and

(B) failing agreement by the persons named in sub-paragraph 11.1(A) above
within 10 Business Days of such request for escalation to them, the resolution
of a dispute or difference shall be escalated (at the written request of

---|--- 

11.2

|

Nothing in sub-paragraph 11.1 above shall prevent any Party from initiating

The Claiming Party will not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable
to the other Party (the "Non-Claiming Party") for a delay in performing or
failure to perform any obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this

|

Analytical testing services 

| 
---|--- 

(xiv)

|

PAS will provide the Purchaser with all chemical analytical testing based on
2011 full year test volumes. 

| 
---|--- 

(xv)

|

Premier Foods will either a) conduct in-house or b) conduct through a Third

perform the analytical testing services. They will also ensure that test
methods used are adequately defined, documented and understood. 

| 
---|--- 

(xvi)

|

The chemical analytical testing requirements are split into two distinct
levels of priority: 


| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

routine chemical testing - meaning forecasted testing; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

emergency response chemical testing - meaning testing that is conducted as a
priority, in response to a potential or actual food safety issue. 

| 
---|--- 

(xvii)

|

Examples of testing that will be provided in either of the above scenarios
include: 

Chemistry

collection of the sample from their site and delivery to Premier Foods' PAS
laboratory/Third Party Service Provider (as per current Premier Foods'
Business as Usual). 


| 
---|--- 

(b)

Accordingly, the Seller and the Purchaser shall procure (to the extent that

Agreement, but only to extent that they include income or expenditure which is
referable to the period after Completion. For the avoidance of doubt, it is

Notional VAT Credit of the Company, together with reasonable explanatory
details, workings and calculations (the "VAT Statement"). Within fifteen
Business Days of the delivery of the VAT Statement, the Seller and Purchaser
shall procure that any payments necessary to ensure that the net amount paid
in respect of the Company's Notional VAT Liability or Notional VAT Credit
pursuant to the Tax Statement in sub-paragraph 4.1 is equal to what it would
have been if the Notional Tax Liability or Notional VAT Credit in the Tax
Statement had been the Notional Tax Liability or Notional Tax Credit in the
VAT Statement unless the Purchaser disputes the information in the VAT
Statement in which case the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 7
shall apply mutatis mutandis to determine that dispute as such provisions
apply in respect of disputes relating to the Draft Profit Accounts. If such a
dispute is raised, then the finally determined version of the VAT Statement
shall be used to determine the relevant Notional VAT Liability or Notional VAT
Credit (rather than the version of the VAT Statement provided by the Seller).

| 
---|--- 

4.3

|

For the avoidance of doubt, no amount shall be payable in respect of the same
liability both pursuant to this Schedule and in respect of any Warranty or
Business Purchase Agreement Warranty being breached or being inaccurate or
misleading, or in respect of any breach of, or under, any other provision of
this Agreement or under the other Transaction Documents. The Purchaser shall
procure that the Company complies fully with this sub-paragraph 4.3. 

| 
---|--- 

4.4

|

If the Tax Statement or the VAT Statement, as the case may be, shows that the
Company has a Notional VAT Credit, then the Seller shall procure that the
representative member of the VAT Group pays to the Company such amounts as are
equal to the Notional VAT Credit. If the Tax Statement or the VAT Statement,
as the case may be, shows that the Company has a Notional VAT Liability, then
the Purchaser shall procure that the Company pays to the representative member
of the VAT Group such amounts as are equal to the Notional VAT Liability. 

5. General

| 
---|--- 

5.1

|

All payments to be made under this Schedule shall be made in immediately
available funds in pounds sterling without any set-off, restriction or
condition and without any deduction or withholding (save only as may be
required by law) by telegraphic transfer to the account of the Purchaser or,
as the case may be, the Seller notified in advance to the Party making the
payment by the Party receiving the payment. 

| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

Any payment made by the Seller pursuant to paragraph 5.1 shall take effect as
an alteration to the consideration for the sale of the Shares.
