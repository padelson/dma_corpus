vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of October 16, 2007, by and among Munich-American Holding
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Monument Corporation, an
Ohio corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), and The Midland Company, an Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") and each share (a " _Share_ ") of the common stock,
without par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, other than Shares held by the
Company or Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company or of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, and other than the Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(d)), will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $65.00 per
Share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), all upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub are entering into a Voting
Agreement with certain significant shareholders of the Company (the " _Voting
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which each of those shareholders has agreed, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to vote all shares of the
Company owned by such shareholder in accordance with the terms of the Voting
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "),
acting upon the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors
(the " _Special Committee_ ") thereof has determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, (i) the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub have approved this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) the management board
of Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, the parent company of Parent ("
_Munich Parent_ "), has authorized the Merger, each on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:



 

1 ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2)
and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised Code (the " _ORC_ "), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). At
the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
ORC, including Section 1701.82.

SECTION 1.2. _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger, in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of, the ORC (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), together with any
required related certificates, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Ohio in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ORC (the time of
such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (or such later
time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Certificate of Merger) being the " _Effective Time_ "). The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb
Steen and Hamilton LLP, located at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, at 10
a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article V_ (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied only at the Closing), or at such other
time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the actual
date and time at which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

SECTION 1.3. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and Section 1701.82 of the ORC.

SECTION 1.4. _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended
and restated in their entirety to be identical to the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the ORC and as provided in
such articles of incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective
Time, Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is The Midland Company." At the Effective Time, the code of
regulations of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
be identical to the code of regulations of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the ORC and as provided in such code of regulations.

SECTION 1.5. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective
successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal.



 

2 SECTION 1.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any Shares, the following shall occur:

(a) _Company Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any (i) Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares, will be canceled and extinguished
and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate representing
such Share in the manner provided in Section 1.8 (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond or
indemnity, if required, in the manner provided in Section 1.10). At the
Effective Time, such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each Share held by the
Company or Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company or of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or the payment of any
consideration therefor.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of
the Surviving Corporation, which shares of common stock shall constitute the
only outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 1701.85 of
the ORC (" _Section 1701.85_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(a), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Shares in
accordance with, and only to the extent required by, the provisions of Section
1701.85. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.85. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 1701.85, or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under
Section 1701.85 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed  



 

3  to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(a).
The Company shall notify Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
ORC received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right and opportunity
reasonably to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

(e) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the applicable restrictions contained
in Section 4.1, if at any time between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of Shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares or any similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or similar event.

SECTION 1.7. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any stock options (each, a "
_Company Option_ ") granted pursuant to the Company stock plans listed in
Section 1.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Stock Plans_
") that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not vested, shall be converted into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of
such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares covered by such
Company Option, less any required withholding Taxes.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share of
restricted stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, vested or unvested
(each a " _Restricted Share_ "), shall as of the Effective Time become fully
vested and free of any forfeiture restriction and converted into the right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, less any
required withholding Taxes.

(c) _Performance-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive
shares of Company Common Stock or cash in respect of outstanding performance-
based awards under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Performance-Based
Award_ "), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Performance-Based Award to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation equal to (i) the number of shares issuable pursuant to
the Performance-Based Award calculated at 154% of the "target level" for 2007
and calculated at 100% of the "target level" for 2008 and 2009, multiplied by
(ii) the per share Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes.



 

4 (d) _Director Performance Share Equivalents_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall make such additional contributions to the
account of each non-employee director under the Companys Non-Employee
Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the " _Non-Employee Directors Plan_ ") as
are described in Section 11 of the Non-Employee Directors Plan. At the
Effective Time, and after giving effect to the preceding sentence, each
Company Common Share equivalent contained in each non-employee directors
deferred compensation account (each a " _Director Performance Share
Equivalent_ ") under the Non-Employee Directors Plan shall as of the
Effective Time entitle the beneficiary thereto to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to
(i) the total number of Director Performance Share Equivalents, multiplied by
(ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes. 

(e) _ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Purchase
Period (as that term is defined in the Companys 2000 Associate Discount
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) which ends on November 30, 2007 is the
last Purchase Period under the ESPP. No further elections to purchase Shares
may be made on or after the date hereof under the ESPP.

(f) _ESSAP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary so that no further
awards shall be made on or after the date hereof under the Companys 2006
Employee Stock Service Award Plan (the " _ESSAP_ ").

(g) _ASAP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary so that no further
Accounting Periods (as that term is defined in the Companys Agent Stock
Acquisition Program (the " _ASAP_ ")) shall begin on or after the date hereof
under the ASAP. No further elections to purchase Shares may be made on or
after the date hereof under the ASAP.

(h) _Further Actions_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary,
including, after consultation with Parent, making any plan amendments, for the
sole purpose of implementing the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.7.

SECTION 1.8. _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company with the Companys prior approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to act as the Paying
Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in the Merger and shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Merger Sub to, deposit in trust with
the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this Article I, the
aggregate consideration to which the holders of Shares are entitled pursuant
to this Article I. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter
be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".



 

5 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of Book-Entry Shares or of a Certificate or Certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash (after taking into account
all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares surrendered by such holder) to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and the Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than a Person in whose name in which the Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the
payment thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 1.8, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing any Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(e) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Shares or other securities such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis,
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the Companys shareholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to the
Companys shareholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to
Parent.



 

6 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates nine months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who have not surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
compliance with this Section 1.8 shall after such delivery to Parent look only
to Parent for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), with
respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to five (5) years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.8, neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

SECTION 1.9. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

SECTION 1.10. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver such customary indemnities or bonds which
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably require.

as follows:

SECTION 2.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. (a) The Company
is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all corporate power and

Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation
or entity authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the
character of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated or the nature

Adverse Effect.

(b) (i) Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each Subsidiary of the Company and the state or jurisdiction of its

Subsidiary Securities, except immaterial Liens (if any) relating to the
shares of Subsidiaries (provided that no shares of any Subsidiary are pledged
to secure indebtedness for money borrowed of the Company or any other Person).

_Company Agency Subsidiaries_ ") and the states in which the Company, the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries and the Company Agency Subsidiaries are
domiciled or, as applicable, "commercially domiciled" for insurance regulatory
purposes. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been notified by
any Governmental Entity that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has

by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors rights generally, general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board, acting upon and in

in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or require the consent
of any Person under, or (B) result in the loss of a material benefit under,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of, or (C) result in the creation of any Lien on any of the

in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, violation,
breach, default, loss, right or other occurrence, or consents not obtained
(disregarding consents with respect to agreements with Bell and Clements),
which would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

in Section 2.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (vi) any such

11 SECTION 2.6. _Compliance With Law_.

(a) The business and operations of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
are, and have been, conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws, except
for such non-compliance as would not constitute, individually or in the

foregoing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been marketing,
selling and issuing insurance products in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all applicable orders and directives of all insurance regulatory

before any Governmental Entity or other Person regarding whether any of the
Subsidiaries has violated any applicable Laws, nor is there any pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened investigation by any Governmental
Entity with respect to possible material violations of any applicable Laws,

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are not in violation or breach of, or default under, any Permit,
except where such violation, breach or default would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No event
or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation or
breach of, or a default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an
obligation of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries under, any
Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except

not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

filing), none of the SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes thereto) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC
Reports, as amended or supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "), comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in
accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes
in shareholders equity for the periods indicated therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material in
amount or significance, in each case as permitted by GAAP and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC). To the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of any ongoing review
or investigation by the SEC and there are no unresolved SEC comments with
respect to any of such documents.



 

13 (c) As used herein, the term " _Company SAP Statements_ " means all annual and
quarterly statutory statements, together with all exhibits, interrogatories,
notes and schedules thereto and any actuarial opinions, affirmations or
certifications or other supporting documents required in connection therewith,
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries as filed with the applicable insurance
regulatory authorities in their respective jurisdictions of incorporation for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the quarterly periods
ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries
has filed or submitted all Company SAP Statements required to be filed with or
submitted to the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the
jurisdiction in which it is domiciled or commercially domiciled on forms
prescribed or permitted by such authority, except for such failures to file
that would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company SAP Statements have each been delivered
to Parent prior to the date hereof and were prepared in all material respects
in accordance with SAP consistently applied for the periods covered thereby
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and the Company SAP
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the statutory financial
position of such Subsidiaries of the Company as at the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations of such Subsidiaries of the Company for
the respective periods then ended. No material weakness has been asserted
with respect to any Company SAP Statements filed prior to the date hereof by
any Governmental Entity that has not been cured, waived or otherwise resolved
to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity, except for those
deficiencies that would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The statutory balance sheets and income
statements included in the Company SAP Statements have been audited by
the Companys independent auditors, and the Company has delivered or made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all audit opinions related
thereto for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2004. Except as indicated
therein, all assets that are reflected as admitted assets on the Company SAP
Statements comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws with
respect to admitted assets. There are no permitted practices utilized by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in the preparation of the Company SAP Statements.

(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or its accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any nonexclusive ownership and
nondirect control that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this Section 2.7(d). The Company has
implemented and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that (i)
was effective as of December 31, 2005 and (ii) with respect to subsequent
periods was designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and such system of
internal control over financial reporting is effective. To the knowledge of
the Company, the Company has not identified any material weaknesses in its
system of internal control over financial reporting and has no reason to
believe that its officers will not be in a position to furnish the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company (i) has implemented and
maintains  



 

14  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
frames specified by the SECs rules and forms (and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective) and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (A) any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company has delivered to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by
the management of the Company since January 1, 2002. Since December 31, 2005,
any material change in internal control over financial reporting required to
be disclosed in any Company SEC Report has been so disclosed.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or
otherwise, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to be
recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, that would
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, other than liabilities, obligations or contingencies (i) reflected or
reserved against on the December 31 Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto or
(ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2006 (none of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would constitute, or could reasonably be expected to constitute, a
Company Material Adverse Effect). The " _December 31 Balance Sheet_ " means
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated as of December 31, 2006
included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006 filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof.

SECTION 2.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since December 31, 2006, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their business only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action since
December 31, 2006 that, if taken after the date of this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Parent, would constitute a breach of  _Section
4.1(a), (b), (c) (other than quarterly dividends heretofore paid in 2007),
(d), (j), (k), (l) or (u)_.

(b) Since December 31, 2006, there has not been (and there is not) any
change, condition, event, occurrence, fact, effect or development that has
had, or, to the knowledge of the Company, could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 2.9. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no claim, litigation, action,
suit, proceeding, arbitration, mediation or investigation (whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other, whether at law or in equity) (each, a "
_Proceeding_ ") before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against or relating to the Company or  



 

15  any of its Subsidiaries or any properties or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than any such Proceeding (i) that is ordinary course
claims litigation related to policies or contracts of insurance written by any
Company Insurance Subsidiary seeking benefits thereunder or (ii) that are not
reasonably likely to constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets is subject to
any outstanding order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any
Governmental Entity, except for those that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
No officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
defendant in any Proceeding before any federal, state, local or foreign court
in connection with his or her status as an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of the Company, since January
1, 2005 no such Proceeding has been threatened. Section 2.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of each
Proceeding before any federal, state, local or foreign court resolved or
settled since January 1, 2006 and requiring payment by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in excess of $250,000 or involving the imposition on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of injunctive or other non-monetary relief.

contracts, policies or arrangements contributed to, sponsored or maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or otherwise, as of
the date hereof for the benefit of any current, former or retired employee,
officer, consultant, agent, independent contractor or director of the Company
or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") (such plans,
programs, policies, agreements and arrangements, including the Company Stock
Plans, collectively, " _Company Plans_ ").

such Company Plan, (D) all prospectuses prepared in connection with any such

applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws, rules and
regulations.

the Code or Title IV of ERISA and (ii) single employer pension plans (within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, together with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, is or was treated as a single employer under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, together with the Company, an "
_ERISA Affiliate_ ") would reasonably be expected to incur liability under
Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, each with respect to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries maintains, contributes to or has any liability.

(e) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate contributes
to, or has contributed to, a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

(f) Since January 1, 2004, no Company Plan that is subject to Section 401(a)
of the Code has been completely or partially terminated. To the knowledge of
the Company, none of the Company Plans has been the subject of a

Effective Time.

(g) As of the date hereof, no Proceedings before a Governmental Entity (other

the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Plan that
would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
Company.

(h) Each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and
no condition exists which would adversely affect such
favorable determination.

(i) Neither the execution by the Company of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) constitute an
event under any Company Plan or any trust or loan related to any of those
plans or agreements that will or may result in any payment,
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee
or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or
limitations on the right of the Company to amend or terminate any Company
Plan.



 

17 (j) There have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions," as described in

Except pursuant to a Company Plan, no written or oral representations

option grants undertaken by the Company have not identified any problem with
respect to the timing of the option grants.

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (i) all reinsurance treaties or
agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material existing rights,
obligations or liabilities (the " _Company Reinsurance Agreements_ ") are in

recoverable by them pursuant to any Company Reinsurance Agreement, and all
such amounts have been properly recorded in its books and records and are
properly reflected in the Company SAP Statements. The Company Reinsurance

Reinsurance Agreements to be properly accounted for as reinsurance.

available to Parent a true and complete copy of all material actuarial
reports prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, from and after

and modifications thereto. There have been no actuarial reports of a similar
nature covering any of the entities referred to in those reports in respect of
any period subsequent to the latest period covered in such actuarial reports.

otherwise noted in such financial statements); (ii) were fairly stated in all
material respects in accordance with sound actuarial principles; (iii)

the Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the 2006 fiscal year, a copy of which

provisions for all actuarial reserves and related items  



 

27  which ought to be established in accordance with applicable Laws and in
accordance, in all material respects, with prudent insurance practices
generally followed in the insurance industry. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts or circumstances which would necessitate any
material adverse change in such reserves above those reflected in the Company
SAP Statements (other than increases consistent with past experience
resulting from the ordinary course of business).

(d) _Rates and Forms_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all binders,

any applications, supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary documents in

assumed by the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries that are

other than contingent commissions paid to licensed agents.

(f) _Agents_. The Company has disclosed to Parent a list of the top 50
agents (by gross written premiums sold) of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the gross written premium sold by
each of these agents in such year with respect to products issued by any
Company Insurance Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company, the contracts
and other agreements pursuant to which agents act on behalf of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries are valid, binding and in full force and effect in all
material respects in accordance with their terms and the parties to such
contracts and agreements are not in default thereunder in any material
respects. To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in Section
2.23(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2007 through the
date of this Agreement, none of the agents listed in Section 2.23(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule has (a) terminated its relationship with any of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries or (b) materially decreased the placement,
marketing or sales of products issued by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries.

business written, sold or produced in the particular jurisdiction in which
such agent wrote, sold or produced such business for such Company
Insurance Subsidiary and (ii) was duly appointed as an agent by such Company

Subsidiaries for new business as of the date hereof.

agreements and understandings that are explicitly defined in such reinsurance
or coinsurance contract. As used herein, the term "Finite Insurance Agreement"

of the Company been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
contemplating any such undertaking.

(i) _Certain Products_. To the knowledge of the Company, all of its products
and the products of its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed and
marketed as "insurance" are filed and marketed as insurance. Neither

insurance constitute or are subject to regulation as "insurance" under
applicable Law.

of each Vessel owned by it and has good title to each such Vessel free
and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Liens that collateralize indebtedness
that is properly reflected on the December 31 Balance Sheet and (ii) Permitted
Liens, provided that the obligations collateralized by such Permitted Liens
are not delinquent or are being contested in good faith.

the transactions described in this Agreement will not constitute a default
under or cause for termination or modification of any of the Maritime
Contracts, except, in the case of clauses (iii)-(vi) immediately above, for

Subsidiaries as a whole.



 

30 (d) With respect to each Vessel and except as would not be material to the

PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Subject to and as qualified by items set forth in the disclosure schedule (the
" _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being agreed that a
matter disclosed with respect to one representation or warranty shall also be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to each other representation or warranty
to the extent the applicability of such matter is reasonably apparent on the

respect to such matter), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, hereby
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

SECTION 3.1. _Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or
organized and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted except where the failure to be so
organized, existing, in good standing or to have such power or authority would
not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Merger Sub Material
Adverse Effect. Parent owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub
free and clear of all Liens. Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided to
the Company the name of the "ultimate parent entity" for purposes of
obtaining the approvals of the Governmental Entities contemplated by this

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no business
activities except as contemplated by this Agreement. " _Merger Sub Material
Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub, on or before the Outside Date, to perform their respective

by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly

to authorize this Agreement, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the ORC). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

SECTION 3.3. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. (a) The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, do not
and will not (i) conflict with or violate the respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b)
below have been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been
made, conflict with or violate any Law, any of its Permits or any rule or
regulation of any stock exchange applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by
which either of them or any of their respective properties are bound or (iii)
(A) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or require
the consent of any Person under or (B) result in the loss of a material
benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of, or (C) result in the creation of any Lien on
any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any Contracts
to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party
or by which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, acceleration,
loss, right or other occurrence which would not constitute, individually or
in the aggregate, a Merger Sub Material Adverse Effect.

Merger Sub Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective properties or assets is subject to any outstanding

hereby deemed superseded by this Agreement and shall have no further force or
effect.

obligations.

SECTION 4.3. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Subject to _Section 4.3(b)_, the
Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)

connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal or the making of any offer or
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any
Person non-public information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any

Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company or any of its
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party in each case
unless the Special Committee and the Company Board, after consultation with
its outside counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to do so would
violate its fiduciary  



 

39  duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law. The Company
shall request the prompt return of any confidential information provided to
any third party prior to the date hereof in connection with a possible
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
action by the Companys Representatives, Subsidiaries of the Company or
Representatives of Subsidiaries of the Company that would constitute a
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.3 if done by the
Company, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall constitute a breach of this Section
4.3 by the Company. The Company shall promptly inform its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 4.3

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 4.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company has
received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party, (ii) a breach by the Company of this _Section 4.3_ has not contributed
to the making of such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Special Committee or
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal;  _provided_ , that (x) the Company will not, and will not allow its
Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person unless
the Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality and standstill
agreement with such Person containing terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) the Company
will substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person
which was not previously provided to Parent; _provided_ _further_ , that with
respect to each of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), both (1) the Company
Board and the Special Committee have concluded, in good faith and after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
violate its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law and (2) the Company has provided Parent with notice of its
intent to take any such action prior to taking such action and has otherwise
complied with Section 4.3(c).

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary
course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any
inquiry, contact or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include the material terms of
the Acquisition Proposal or the inquiry, contact or request and, if in
writing, shall include a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or related inquiry,
contact or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis (and in any event within one Business Day) of the status of
any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, contact or request (including the material
terms and conditions thereof) and any material developments, discussions and
negotiations related thereto, and will provide Parent as soon as practicable
after receipt thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material
sent or provided to the Company from any third party in connection therewith.
The Company shall promptly notify  



 

40  Parent upon determination by the Company Board or Special Committee that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to provide Parent with any of the
aforementioned information to the extent that doing so would violate the terms
of any confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party on the date
hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) notify Parent if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to  _Section 4.3(b)_.

(d) Subject to the second sentence of this Section 4.3(d), neither the Company
Board nor the Special Committee shall, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or
the declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in items (i) and (ii), a " _Change of Board
Recommendation_ ") or (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to adopt, approve or recommend, or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, any merger agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, acquisition agreement,
joint venture agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding (A) constituting or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, or otherwise relating to, an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality and standstill agreement referred to in Section
4.3(b)) or (B) requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(other than any agreement entered into in accordance with this Section
4.3). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval the Company receives (without violation of this
Agreement) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party which the Special Committee and the Company Board conclude in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and their financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, including
pursuant to clause (C) below, the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, if the Special Committee or the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would violate its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation
and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(b) to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board
Recommendation unless (A) there shall not have been a breach of this Section
4.3, (B) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least three Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the per share value of the consideration offered therein
and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall
have contemporaneously provided Parent with a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") and (C) prior
to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation the Company shall, and shall
direct its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with  



 

41  Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the
event that any material revisions (or revisions that in the aggregate are
material) are made to the initial Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver
to Parent within one Business Day written notice of any such material
revisions (including a detailed description thereof) and a new Notice Period
shall be deemed to have commenced with respect to such modified Superior
Proposal on the date of delivery of such notice to Parent.

(e) Subject to Parents rights under Section 6.4, nothing contained in this
_Section 4.3_ shall prohibit the Special Committee or the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , that any such disclosure other than (i) a "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the shareholders of the Company), (ii) an express rejection of any applicable
Alternative Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of its recommendation
to its shareholders in favor of the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change of
Board Recommendation; and _provided_   _further_ that neither the Company
Board nor the Special Committee shall be permitted to recommend that the
Companys shareholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or
exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal or withhold, withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation), unless in
each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board effects a Change of
Board Recommendation in accordance with the terms of Section 4.3(d).

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, offer or proposal, written or oral, or any indication of interest in
making an offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time after the
date hereof relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to (A)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, tender offer or
exchange offer, sale of shares of capital stock or sale of assets or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the
Companys acquisition of a third party in a transaction in which the
shareholders of such third party immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction will own 20% or more of the Companys outstanding capital stock
immediately following such transaction, including the issuance by the Company
of 20% or more of any class of its voting equity securities as consideration
for assets or securities of a third party, (C) any transaction which
is structured to permit any Person or group, alone or together with any other
Person or group, to acquire beneficial ownership of (1) at least 20% of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (2) at least 20% of
the equity interests or voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries if such Subsidiaries own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the assets referred to in clause (1), pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets,
tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or
multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other
than the Merger or (D) any other transaction having a similar effect to those
described in clauses (A)  (C), in each case other than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal not arising from a
breach of this Section 4.3 (except the references therein to "20%" shall be
replaced by "50%") which the Special Committee and the Company  



 

42  Board determine in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and legal counsel) (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that the Company Board and the Special Committee have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal
counsel, is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the transactions provided for in this Agreement, in
each case with respect to clauses (A) and (B), taking into account, among
other things, the Person or group making such Acquisition Proposal and all
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of this Agreement and
such Acquisition Proposal, including any conditions relating to financing,
regulatory approvals or other events or circumstances beyond the control of
the party invoking the condition and taking into account any revisions made or
proposed in writing by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the time of such
determination.

SECTION 4.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth below, the Company will
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and from and after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with
their terms, all then-existing employment, change in control and severance
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that
the aggregate of all payments under such agreements triggered by the Merger
will not exceed $21,000,000 as shown in Section 03.03.39.03 of the Intralinks
electronic data room for this transaction (as in effect on the date hereof),
subject to such changes as Parent may approve.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second
anniversary thereof, to maintain for the individuals employed by the Company
at the Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") compensation and benefits
provided under employee benefit plans of Parent that are at least as
favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits maintained for and
provided to Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.4_ shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any Company Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations
right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with
applicable Law.

(c) Parent currently intends to continue the Cincinnati-based operations of
the Company.

(d) To the extent individuals employed by the Company at the Effective Time
Current Employees participate in employee benefit plans of Parent,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by such Current Employees prior to the Effective Time to be taken
into account for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual
purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) under such
employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under
the corresponding Company Plans for those purposes. To the extent Current
Employees participate in a health employee benefit plan of Parent, (i) they
will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation under any such
health employee benefit plan of  



 

43  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for
which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding
Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to
give such Current Employees credit under such employee benefit plans for co-
payments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time in the
applicable year.

(e) This _Section 4.4_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.4_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section 4.4_
or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or limit in any way
the right of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any of its respective employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

(f) In the event that the Closing Date is on or before December 31, 2007, all
Annual Incentive Plan, Sales Incentive Plan and Profit Sharing
Plan obligations relating to the 2007 Plan Year (each as defined under the
Company Plans) shall be calculated as if the Closing Date were on or after
January 1, 2008, and payment of such obligations shall be made in accordance
with past practices, except that any person employed by the Company at the
Closing Date shall be declared to be employed by the Company at the payment
date even if such is not the case (with the intended effect that employees
participating in such plan will receive their full award for 2007 thereunder,
regardless of when the Closing occurs).

(g) In the event the business of the Company Shipping Subsidiaries is sold
prior to January 1, 2008, the Company will pay to the employees engaged in
such business their full bonus for 2007, payable upon the consummation of such
sale.

SECTION 4.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation and code of regulations shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation from liabilities and indemnification of
the present (as of the Effective Time) or former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company than are currently provided in
the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the
expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or unless
amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights to indemnification or exculpation
that any Person may have under any agreement, Company Plan or
otherwise, which Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director, employee and
agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons
heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements, incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil,
criminal,  



 

44  administrative or investigative, arising out of, pertaining to or in
connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such service was at the request of the
Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of any
such proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of the proceeding from Parent (provided that
any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification). Parent shall cooperate with the Indemnified
Parties in the defense of any such matter and any determination made
or required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with standards under applicable Law shall be made by independent
legal counsel acceptable to Parent, as the case may be, and the Indemnified
Party. The Surviving Corporation shall perform its obligations under such
indemnification provisions in accordance with their respective terms.

(c) The Company shall purchase by the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain, tail policies to the current directors
and officers liability insurance policies maintained on the date of
this Agreement by the Company and with respect to the directors and officers
who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies, which tail policies (i) shall not have a premium in
excess of 300% of the annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof to maintain the existing policies (which amount is set
forth in Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) shall be
effective for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) shall contain coverage that is
at least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage
provided by such existing policies (complete and accurate copies of which have
been made available to Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if equivalent
coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying an aggregate
premium in excess of 300% of such amount, the Company shall only be required
to obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain)
as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an aggregate premium equal
to 300% of such amount.

(d) This _Section 4.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity
referred to in clause (a) of this _Section 4.5_ (whether or not parties to
this Agreement). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting
from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in
this _Section 4.5_.

SECTION 4.6. _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, each party
will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cooperate fully with the other
parties, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to  



 

45  comply as promptly as practicable with all requirements of Governmental
Entities applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent required
under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws, each party hereto agrees to make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act or other required filing or application under Foreign Antitrust Laws, as
applicable, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or such Foreign Antitrust Laws, as applicable, and to take all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain consent,
approvals or authorizations under Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act.

(b) The Company agrees reasonably to cooperate with Parent to effect a
strategy reasonably satisfactory to Parent so that the Companys operation
of the barge business following the Effective Time will not result in a
violation of Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended (46
U.S.C. Sections 12119 and 50501) (the " _Jones Act_ "). Without limitation,
such strategy may consist of one of the following, to become effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) Bareboat Charter Option: the
creation of a special purpose vehicle that is qualified as a "passive
investor" with the United States Coast Guard in accordance with the Jones
Act, whose sole purpose will be to hold Lien-free title to the Vessels and to
enter into bareboat charters with an unaffiliated third party qualified to
operate vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (a " _Jones Act Operator_ ") who
will bareboat charter the Vessels for a minimum term of three years and take
assignment of all applicable Maritime Contracts, (ii) Time Charter Option: the
sale of the Vessels to a Jones Act Operator who will operate the Vessels and
time charter the Vessels back to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or
(iii) Sale of the Barge Business: the sale of one or more of the Company
Shipping Subsidiaries (or of all or a portion of the assets thereof) to a
Jones Act Operator.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
4.6(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any Foreign
Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed
of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party and its
outside counsel to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.



 

46 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in  _Sections 4.6(a)_ and _(c)_ , (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
prepare and file with the relevant insurance regulators requests for approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use all
reasonable efforts to have such insurance regulators approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each party shall give the other party
prompt written notice if it receives any material notice from any insurance
regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and, in the case of any such written material notice, shall promptly furnish
the other party with a copy thereof, (iii) all applications and substantive
correspondence with the insurance regulators shall be submitted in advance to
the Company and the Company shall have an opportunity to provide comments
thereon and (iv) to the extent permitted, practicable and reasonable, each
party shall have the right to participate in and shall, to the
extent practicable, receive reasonable prior notice of, all telephone calls
and meetings of the other party with any insurance regulators in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If an insurance regulator
requires that a hearing be held in connection with its approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange for such hearing to be held promptly. Parent may seek to
obtain regulatory approval of a dividend, affiliated loan or similar
arrangement to be paid or made by Munich Reinsurance America, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and an Affiliate of Parent, to fund the full amount of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and the other amounts required to be paid by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_
that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require such regulatory
approval or the payment of such dividend, loan or similar arrangement prior to
or as a condition to Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with
Parent as reasonably requested by Parent to obtain such regulatory approval.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Sections 4.6(a), (c)_ and _(d)_ , if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR
Act, any Foreign Antitrust Law, any Insurance Law or any other applicable Law
(other than the Jones Act) or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of the HSR Act, any Foreign Antitrust Law, any Insurance
Law or any other applicable Law (other than the Jones Act) or which would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections
or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in
any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to consent
to a condition or burden imposed by any Governmental Entity if, in
the reasonable judgment of the burdened party, such condition or burden would
materially and adversely affect the business or operations of such burdened
party and its Subsidiaries, of such burdened partys parent companies, or of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries.



 

47 (f) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other
and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third
parties with respect to any Contracts to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party as may be necessary or appropriate for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or required by the terms
of any Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.7. _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall, upon
the request of Parent or Merger Sub, (a) take all reasonable steps to exclude
the applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby
of any Takeover Laws, (b) assist in any challenge by Parent or Merger Sub to
the validity, or the applicability to the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, of any Takeover Laws and (c) if any Takeover
Laws become applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions
provided for in this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Laws on this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.8. _Proxy Statement_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all
information as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall as
promptly as practicable provide Parent and Merger Sub with, and consult with
Parent and Merger Sub regarding, any comments that may be received from the
SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall, after consultation with Parent,
respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall cause the Proxy Statement
in definitive form to be mailed to the Companys shareholders at the earliest
practicable date. All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and all mailings to or other
communications with the Companys shareholders in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be subject to
the prior review of Parent. If at any time prior to the Closing, any
information relating to the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an  



 

48  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the shareholders of the Company.

SECTION 4.9. _Shareholders  Meeting_. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Article VI, the Company, acting through the
Company Board and the Special Committee, shall duly call and hold a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") as promptly as
practicable following the date on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC for the sole purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval and
shall, (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 4.3(d), make the Company
Board Recommendation and include such Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Requisite Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof,
unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article VI_ ,
the Company shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the
Company Shareholders Meeting even if the Company Board or the Special
Committee shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation
thereof or otherwise effected a Change of Board Recommendation or proposed or
announced an intention to do so.

SECTION 4.10. _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement or broad-based written
statement to the Company Employees or Parents employees concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement
may be required by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any
other stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent
so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to obtain the
consent of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with, or provide Parent or
Merger Sub the opportunity to comment on, any public announcement regarding a
competing Acquisition Proposal made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

SECTION 4.11. _Notification_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, upon obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event, which is likely (i) to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect if made as of any time at or prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) to result in any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied hereunder and (iii) in the case of the Company, any change or
development that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any change or development
that is reasonably likely to have a Merger Sub Material Adverse Effect. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.11_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
or otherwise limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
any party receiving such notice.



 

49 SECTION 4.12. _Confidentiality Agreement_. Subject to _Section 4.2(b)_,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii)
the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 4.13. _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall
not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the
date hereof against the Company or any of its directors or executive officers
by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent
of Parent.

SECTION 4.14. _Investments_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, conduct transactions in its or their investments only
in compliance in all material respects with its or their investment policies,
as applicable, in effect on the date hereof (copies of which have previously
been delivered to Parent).

SECTION 4.15. _Section 16(b)_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 4.16. _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each
of the other parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary
to delist the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and any other market or
exchange on which it is listed and to terminate registration under the
Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such delisting and termination
shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

earlier date which shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date),
disregarding for these purposes any exception in such representations
and warranties relating to materiality or a Merger Sub Material Adverse
Effect, except for such failures to be true and correct which would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or which
would prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the Merger.

(b) _Agreements and Covenants_. Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or

provided for herein.

has been executed with a third party but, with respect to the closing of
which, regulatory approval has not be obtained; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
6.2(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, any of the conditions
to the Merger set forth in _Article V_ having failed to be satisfied on or
before the Initial End Date or the Outside Date, as applicable; or

(c) a Government Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.3(a)_ if,

warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement
that would result in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ or
_5.2(b)_ , as applicable, not being satisfied; or

(b) prior to the obtaining of the Requisite Shareholder Approval in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal if: (i) in
light of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board and Special Committee shall
have determined in good faith by resolution duly adopted, after consultation

Special Committee to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would violate
their fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;

of the notice referred to in _Section 4.3(d)_, such Superior Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company, at or prior to any termination

contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Company such that the
closing condition set forth in _Section 5.2(b)_ would not be satisfied or
(ii) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in
_Section 5.2(a)_ would not be satisfied, and, in the case of either (i) or
(ii), such breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date or is
not cured by the Company within twenty (20) Business Days after the Company
receives written notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.4(a) if, at the time of such termination, there exists a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that would result in the closing
conditions set forth in  _Section 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as applicable, not
being satisfied; or

Change of Board Recommendation shall have occurred or the Company Board and

obligations under _Section 4.9_ (other than clause (a) of _Section 4.9_).

SECTION 6.5.  _Effect of Termination_. (a) Any termination of this Agreement

termination by Merger Sub.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 6.5(c)_, in the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this  _Article
VI_, this Agreement (other than _Section 4.2(b)_ and _Articles VI_ and _VII_
) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any
party (or of any of its Representatives);  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such termination shall relieve any Person of any liability or damages
resulting from fraud or an intentional breach of this Agreement.

(c) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_
or by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ or
by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ (provided that the
failure to consummate the Agreement by the Outside Date was not caused by
Parents breach of any of its obligations under the Agreement) or _Section
6.2(a)_ and (A) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to such
termination an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have
been made to the Company Board or the Company or publicly announced and, in
each case, not irrevocably withdrawn, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal which intention has not been irrevocably withdrawn, and (B) within 12
months after the date of such termination, the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company consummates or enters into an agreement with respect to
such transaction;



 

54 then in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$40,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by Parent. Such payment shall be made (1) concurrently
with such termination in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.3(b)_, (2) on the first Business Day following the date of such
termination in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.4(b)_, and (3) with respect to a termination pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_,
the Termination Expenses (as defined below) shall be paid in immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent (I)
concurrently with and as a condition to any such termination effected by the
Company and (II) on the first Business Day following any such termination
effected by Parent, in each case whether or not an event described in _Section
6.5(c)(ii)(B)_ occurs, and the termination fee (less any Termination Expenses
previously paid) shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the
first to occur of the events referred to in clause (B) of _Section
6.5(c)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to
pay a termination fee or the Termination Expenses pursuant to more than one
clause of this _Section 6.5(c)_. For purposes of this _Section 6.5(c)_,
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section
4.3(f)_ except that references in  _Section 4.3(f)_ to "20%" shall be
replaced by "40%". As used herein, " _Termination Expenses_ " means Parents
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all attorneys, accountants and
investment bankers fees and expenses), but not to exceed $3,750,000.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
6.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement.

SECTION 6.6. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, except that each of Parent and the
Company shall pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection
with obtaining the necessary approvals under the HSR Act and any applicable
Insurance Laws.

SECTION 6.7. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after approval of the Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company, no amendment that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such shareholders may
be made without further shareholder approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company.

SECTION 6.8. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to 
_Section 6.7_, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions  



 

55  contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this
Agreement by the Companys shareholders, there may not be any extension or
waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which
adversely affects the rights of the Companys shareholders hereunder without
the approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder.
