<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to an Indemnified
Party hereunder is overtly asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party
by a third party (a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), such Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in no
event later than 10&nbsp;days after the Third Party Claim is so asserted or sought against the
Indemnified Party) notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim enclosing a
copy of all papers served, if any, and specifying the nature of and specific basis for such Third
Party Claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then reasonably
determinable, which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim
(the &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to send or a delay in
sending a Claim Notice as provided above shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such Third Party Claim, except
and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at its sole cost and expense
the defense of such Third Party Claim if it acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such Third Party
Claim and may assert any defense of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party;
<U>provided</U> that the Indemnified Party has the right at its own expense to participate
jointly with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third Party Claim. Counsel
representing both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party must acknowledge in writing its
obligation to act as counsel for all parties being represented and must acknowledge and respect
separate attorney-client privileges with respect to each party represented. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to undertake the defense of any Third Party Claim

cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim,

Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the settlement or judgment involves only the

entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel and at
its own expense. The Indemnified Party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for

<U>Article&nbsp;XIII</U> which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such
claim and the amount or the estimated amount of such claim (the &#147;<U>Indemnity Notice</U>&#148;). The
failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this
<U>Article&nbsp;XIII</U>, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that
it has been actually materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party in writing within 30&nbsp;days from delivery of the Indemnity Notice that
the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim specified by the Indemnified
Party shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall for a period of 30&nbsp;days proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute may, at the option of either
party, be resolved by any method permitted by Law or in equity.
