 (b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of Closing Date Inventory set forth in the Inventory Certificate and such disagreement results in a discrepancy that exceeds $50,000, Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of the Inventory Certificate, deliver a notice to Sellers disagreeing with such calculation.

     ##### 

  

 

difference between Final Closing Date Inventory and Sellers calculation of
Closing Date Inventory set forth in the Inventory Certificate, (ii) by
Sellers if the first such difference is less than the second such difference
and (iii) otherwise, equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other. 

   

 (d) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate and assist each other in the preparation of the calculation of Closing Date Inventory and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this _Section 2.8_, including the making available to the extent necessary of relevant Records and personnel.

 Section 2.9 _Post-Closing Payments and Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Within 5 days after Final Closing Date Inventory has been determined, either by the passage of 30 days following delivery of the Inventory Certificate without the delivery by Buyer of a notice of disagreement or, following resolution of such notice of disagreement, in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_, (i) Sellers shall, if Final Closing Date Inventory is less than Base Inventory, jointly and severally pay to Buyer the amount of such deficiency or (ii) Buyer shall, if Final Closing Date Inventory exceeds Base Inventory, pay to Sellers the amount of such excess, either such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

     ##### 

  

 

Buyer and its Representatives full access during normal business hours to, and

the properties owned and operated by Sellers in relation to environmental
matters shall be subject to _Section 6.1(b)_. 

   

 (b) From the date hereof through the thirtieth business day prior to the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, Buyer and its Representatives shall have the right to conduct in relation to the Transferred Real Property a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conforming to ASTM E-1527-05 using such licensed and reputable consultant as shall be previously approved by Sellers, provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Sellers (a " _Phase I ESA_ "), which may include, if Buyer so desires, a limited compliance assessment. No later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide each Phase I ESA to Sellers. If such Phase I ESA identifies and describes a Potentially Material Environmental Condition and includes a recommendation to perform additional assessment or investigation at any Transferred Real Property, Sellers shall have the right within five (5) business days of receipt of the Phase I ESA to remove such Transferred Real Property from the Purchased Assets to be conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Transferred Real Property is a parcel of Transferred Owned Real Property, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value attributable to such Transferred Owned Real Property set forth in _Schedule 6.1_ ; and _further_ _provided_ that if any such Transferred Real Property is a Critical Property, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer, within 30 days of being invoiced therefor, the reasonably incurred moving expenses to transfer any Purchased Assets, other than Immovable Fixtures, associated with such Critical Property to an alternative facility selected by Buyer within 100 miles of such Critical Property. If Sellers do not notify Buyer of the removal of such Transferred Real Property from the Purchased Assets to be conveyed to Buyer within five (5) business days of receipt of the Phase I ESA, Buyer shall have the further right to conduct a subsurface investigation (" _Phase II ESA_ ") limited to the Potentially Material Environmental Condition so described using a licensed and reputable consultant previously approved by Sellers, provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Sellers. 

   

 (i) All environmental assessments of the Transferred Real Property by Buyer and its Representatives shall be conducted in the presence of a Representative of Sellers, and shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost and expense. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against all costs, loss, damage, liability and expense, including reasonable attorneys fees, relating to or arising from the activities Buyer or Buyers Representatives conducted pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)_; 

  

 (ii) Buyer shall not conduct any invasive testing at any Transferred Real Property prior to providing Sellers with a copy of the relevant Phase I ESA, a written description of the proposed invasive testing, and a reasonable period of time to provide comments, which Buyer agrees to consider in good faith, provided that approval to conduct any recommended Phase II ESA invasive testing shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Sellers. For any invasive sampling, Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take split samples; 

      #####

 (iv) Unless and until Closing occurs, unless otherwise required by Environmental Law, Buyer will not disclose the results of its environmental assessment activities to any Governmental Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer is compelled to disclose such results then Buyer shall notify Sellers not less than fourteen (14) days in advance of any such disclosure and will simultaneously furnish Sellers and their counsel with copies of all materials to be disclosed and shall at the expense of Sellers use reasonable efforts to assist counsel in resisting and/or preparing to make such disclosure; and 

  

 (v) While performing any Phase I ESA or Phase II ESA, Buyer and its Representatives must comply with Sellers written environmental and safety rules and policies at any Transferred Owned Real Property, and with the third-party owners written environmental and safety rules and policies at any Transferred Leased Real Property, to the extent copies of such rules and policies are provided to Buyer and its Representatives in advance of such activities. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Environmental Defects_. 

  

 (a) No later than the Environmental Defect Notice Date, Buyer may deliver to Sellers an Environmental Defect Notice for any Potentially Material Environmental Condition confirmed by a Phase II ESA prepared pursuant to _Section 6.1_. Such Environmental Defect Notice must (i) be in writing and received on or before the Environmental Defect Notice Date, (ii) name the affected Transferred Real Property, (iii) name the condition in, on or under the Transferred Real Property that causes the Potentially Material Environmental Condition, including the approximate date the Potentially Material Environmental Condition commenced, and (iv) provide factual substantiation for the Potentially Material Environmental Condition.

If Sellers elect to remove such Transferred Real Property from the Purchased Assets to be conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement and such Transferred Real Property is a parcel of Transferred Owned Real Property, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value attributable to such asset. If such Transferred Real Property is a Critical Property, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer, within 30 days of being invoiced therefor, the reasonably incurred moving expenses to transfer any Purchased Assets, other than Immovable Fixtures, associated with such Critical Property to an alternative facility selected by Buyer within 100 miles of such Critical Property.

If such Transferred Leased Real Property is a Critical Property, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer, within 30 days of being invoiced therefor, the reasonably incurred moving expenses to transfer any Purchased Assets, other than Immovable Fixtures, associated with such Critical Property to an alternative facility selected by Buyer within 100 miles of such Critical Property. 

   

 (f) With respect to a Critical Property that has been removed from among the Purchased Assets by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or this _Section 6.2_, Buyer may, upon written notice to Sellers, extend the Closing Date for a reasonable period of time in order for Buyer to make alternative arrangements in order to obtain the benefits previously associated with such Critical Property.

 (c) Each of the Sellers and Seller Parent acknowledges that the Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any violation of its obligations under this _Section 6.4_ and that, in addition to all other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, if either Seller or Seller Parent violates any of the covenants set forth in this _Section 6.4_, then, after Buyer has provided written notice of such violation to such Seller or Seller Parent without such Seller or Seller Parent immediately remedying such violation, Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief or such other relief against such Seller as may be provided at Law or in equity together with such damages as may be provided at Law or in equity.

 (d) Sellers and Seller Parent acknowledge that their obligations under this _Section 6.4_ are a material inducement to Buyers execution and performance of this Agreement and that the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.4_ are reasonable as to time, geographic area and scope of activity and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of Buyer. 

      ##### 

  

  

 (e) If the provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to contain unreasonable limitations as to time, geographic area or scope of activity, then such court is hereby directed to reform such provisions to the minimum extent necessary to cause the limitations contained therein as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be reasonable and enforceable. 

   

 (f) Buyer may, at any time and at its sole option, reduce the scope of this _Section 6.4_. 

   

 Section 6.5 _Records_.

The Sellers Disclosure Schedules shall constitute an integral part of this Agreement and, subject to the second sentence of this _Section 6.5_, shall modify or otherwise affect the respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto contained herein.

Should any such fact or condition set forth in such notice require any change to the Sellers Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, Sellers shall promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to the relevant section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules specifying such changes; _provided_ , _however_ , no such supplement shall be deemed a waiver of any breach by Sellers of a representation or warranty made by Sellers in connection with this Agreement or affect Buyers rights to indemnification under _Article XIII_.

After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their Representatives access, during normal business hours, such information and assistance (including the making available of employees) relating to the Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, the defense of any Tax claim or assessment, the performance of their obligations under this Agreement, or the defense or prosecution of any dispute, investigation, inquiry or Legal Proceeding.

If the parties are unable to obtain consent to transfer or are prevented by applicable Law from transferring any Transferred Lease, Transferred Permit or Assumed Contract, then for the remaining term thereof, Buyer shall act as the applicable Sellers agent in the performance of all obligations and liabilities under such Transferred Lease, Transferred Permit or Assumed Contract and such Seller shall act as Buyers agent in the receipt of any benefits (net of Taxes, required withholdings, and other costs reasonably incurred by such Seller), rights or interests which inure to such Seller thereunder. In the event that the foregoing arrangements are prohibited or commercially impracticable with regard to any Transferred Leases (and the associated Transferred Leased Real Property), Transferred Permits or Assumed Contracts, then Buyer, at its option, shall be permitted to designate same as a Retained Liability by notice in writing to the applicable Seller, whereupon the same shall revert to and be a Retained Liability of such Seller and such Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in making alternative arrangements to obtain the benefits previously associated with such Transferred Lease, Transferred Permit or Assumed Contract. 

   

 (d) With respect to a Critical Property for which a consent to lease assignment has not been obtained, Buyer may, upon written notice to Sellers, extend the Closing Date for a reasonable period of time in order for Sellers to obtain such consent or, if a Transferred Lease (and the associated Transferred Leased Real Property) that is a Critical Property is excluded from among the Purchased Assets pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_, for Buyer to make alternative arrangements in order to obtain the benefits previously associated with such Critical Property.

Any Qualifying Business Employee who accepts such offer of employment and becomes an employee of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer as of the Closing Date shall be a " _Transitioned Employee_." 

   

 (b) Except as provided in _Section 8.4(j)_, Sellers shall be responsible for payment of all obligations required or committed to the Business Employees with respect to the period prior to the Effective Time, including salaries, wages, payroll Taxes, retirement, vacation pay and any other obligations and expenses of any kind arising out of the employment by, or termination from the employment of, such Seller of such employees. Buyer shall be responsible for all obligations and costs with respect to Transitioned Employees arising after the Effective Time out of their employment by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or the termination by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer thereof or the hiring practices of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof. 

   

 (c) Buyer is not acquiring or succeeding to any obligations with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Sellers or any Commonly Controlled Entity of either Seller. 

   

 (d) The Seller Plans shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities that may arise with respect to the application of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to, and for extending continuation coverage under, COBRA to any employees and former employees of Sellers, or to any qualified beneficiaries of such employees and former employees, including Transitioned Employees, who incur a "qualifying event" (as that term is defined in Code Section 4980B(f)) on or before the Effective Time. Buyer shall be responsible for any Liabilities that may arise under COBRA with respect to, and for extending continuation coverage under COBRA to, all Transitioned Employees and qualified beneficiaries thereof who incur a "qualifying event" while covered under a Buyer group health plan subsequent to the Effective Time. Sellers will provide the certification described in Sections 9801 et seq. of the Code to the extent required by Law for all Transitioned Employees as of the Closing Date.

 (e) The Seller Plans shall be responsible for the payment of benefits to Transitioned Employees and their dependents or beneficiaries for any claims incurred under the Seller Plans prior to the Effective Time. Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer or its Affiliates (" _Buyer Plans_ ") shall be responsible for the payment of benefits to Transitioned Employees and their dependents or beneficiaries for claims incurred under such Buyer Plans on or after the Effective Time. For this purpose, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance benefits, upon the death, accident or other event giving rise to such benefits, and (ii) medical, dental and prescription drug 

       ##### 

  

     

benefits (including in respect of any hospital confinement), upon provision of
the applicable services, materials or supplies.

    

 (f) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to each Transitioned Employee, including those who are actively employed or on leave, disability or other absence from employment, compensation and benefits that, on the whole, are comparable to the benefits provided by Buyer to its own similarly situated employees as of the date thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed to require Buyer to continue the employment of any employee for any period or to restrict Buyer from making changes to any benefits provided to, or compensation paid to, any employee in the future. As of the Effective Time, all Transitioned Employees shall cease to participate in any Seller Plans. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall allow all Transitioned Employees and their eligible dependents to participate in the Buyer Plans as necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Law, without any gap or loss of benefits or coverage. Except as provided in _Section 8.4(e)_, as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause all Buyer Plans for which Transitioned Employees are eligible to participate on or after Closing to recognize for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes) the years of service of each Transitioned Employee with Sellers and/or their Affiliates (together with any predecessors thereof that previously employed any such Transitioned Employees and as to which a Seller Plan recognizes such years of service) prior to the Closing Date. With respect to each Transitioned Employee and such Transitioned Employees dependents, Buyer shall waive under the Buyer Plans any pre-existing condition exclusions to coverage (but only to the extent coverage was being provided under the Seller Plans to such enrolled Transitioned Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time), any evidence of insurability provisions, any active at work requirement and any waiting period or service requirements that did not exist or had been waived or otherwise satisfied under the Seller Plans. For each Transitioned Employee, Buyer shall apply toward any deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under its health plans applicable to the year of Closing, any amounts paid by such Transitioned Employee during such year toward such requirements and limits under the Seller Plans. 

   

 (g) Within 30 days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall notify Buyer of the total dollar value of all unused vacation days for the Transitioned Employees and shall promptly pay such amount to Buyer.

 (h) If Buyer or an Affiliate thereof maintains a Buyer Plan that is a qualified defined contribution plan, Buyer shall take all action necessary or appropriate to permit the Transitioned Employees to roll over their account balances (other than outstanding plan loans) under the applicable Seller Plan that is a defined contribution plan into such Buyer Plan to the extent it is determined that distribution of such balances from the applicable Seller Plan is permitted by applicable Law. 

   

 (i) Sellers shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of workers compensation claims of Business Employees for injuries sustained prior to the Effective Time whether or not reported to such Seller or any insurer prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be 

       ##### 

  

    

responsible for all costs and expenses of workers compensation claims of any
Transitioned Employees for injuries sustained after the Effective Time. 

   

 (j) _Schedule 4.19_ identifies the retention and severance benefits that have been offered to certain Business Employees. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment in full of all severance payments and payment of half of the retention bonuses so identified that are scheduled to become due and payable to Transitioned Employees; _provided_ that Buyers share of any such retention bonuses shall not exceed $900,000. Sellers shall pay to Buyer on the Closing Date an amount equal to the balance of all retention bonuses so identified that are scheduled to become due and payable to Transitioned Employees. The parties shall collaborate on the details and methodology regarding the delivery of retention bonuses to Transitioned Employees after the Effective Time. Sellers shall be responsible for the payment in full of all retention bonuses and all severance payments that become due and payable to Business Employees that are not Transitioned Employees. 

   

 (k) Nothing contained herein (i) shall confer upon any former, current or future employee of Sellers or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to any benefit or employment or continued employment of any nature, for any specified period, or (b) shall cause the employment status of any former, current or future employee of Sellers or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates to be other than terminable at will. If a person not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to an Employee Benefit Plan or another agreement, plan, program or document, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect. 

   

 Section 8.5 _Scrap Equipment_. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a reasonably complete list of Scrap Equipment related to the Purchased Business that is not located on the Transferred Real Property. Buyer shall have the right, within 180 days of receiving such notice and at Buyers sole expense, to inspect such Scrap Equipment at such other premises and may select to retain any such Scrap Equipment by providing to Sellers a list of Scrap Equipment to remain with the Purchased Business. Any such Scrap Equipment so selected by Buyer shall be actually removed from such location, at Buyers sole cost and expense, within such 180 day period, and any such Scrap Equipment not so selected and removed (the " _Non-Conveyed Scrap Equipment_ ") shall revert to and be retained by Sellers. Sellers shall dispose of the Non-Conveyed Scrap Equipment as scrap metal in the ordinary course of business.

 (b) Buyer and Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to schedule jobs such that there are no jobs related to the Purchased Business being performed as of the Effective Time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to send or a delay in sending a Claim Notice as provided above shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such Third Party Claim, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. 

   

 (b) In the event of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party, at its option, may assume (with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at its sole cost and expense the defense of such Third Party Claim if it acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such Third Party Claim and may assert any defense of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ that the Indemnified Party has the right at its own expense to participate jointly with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third Party Claim. Counsel representing both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party must acknowledge in writing its obligation to act as counsel for all parties being represented and must acknowledge and respect separate attorney-client privileges with respect to each party represented. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the defense of any Third Party Claim 

       ##### 

  

    

hereunder, (i) the Indemnifying Party and its counsel shall keep the
Indemnified Party reasonably informed as to its conduct of such defense, and
(ii) the Indemnified Party must cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim, including providing access to
information, making documents available for inspection and copying, and
making employees available for interviews, depositions and trial. The
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to settle or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the settlement or judgment involves
only the payment of money damages, contains a full and complete release of
the Indemnified Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party, by the 30th day after receipt of the Claim Notice (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding the day on which an answer or other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment by default in favor of the Person asserting such Third Party Claim), does not assume actively and in good faith the defense of any such Third Party Claim or action resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, defend against such Third Party Claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party is entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

   

 (d) The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives all Records and other materials required by the Indemnifying Party and in the possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party, for the use of the Indemnified Party and its Representatives in defending any such Third Party Clam, and shall in other respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense. 

   

 (e) If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party under this  _Article XIII_ which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such claim and the amount or the estimated amount of such claim (the " _Indemnity Notice_ "). The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this  _Article XIII_, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within 30 days from delivery of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim specified by the Indemnified Party shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall for a period of 30 days proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute may, at the option of either party, be resolved by any method permitted by Law or in equity. 

       #####

Sellers shall have the right to attend any such discussions, negotiations or proceedings at its own expense, and Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide Sellers with at least five business days notice in advance of any such discussions or meeting in order to allow Sellers the opportunity to attend the same. With respect to each Seller Environmental Liability: (i) Buyer shall provide Sellers with copies of any reports, studies, notices or filings regarding the Remedial Action prior to filing or otherwise submitting them to any applicable Government Authority and shall allow Sellers a reasonable opportunity to review them and, if requested, shall give reasonable consideration to any comments of Sellers prior to making such submittal to such Governmental Authority; and (ii) Buyer shall, from time to time and as may be reasonably requested by Sellers, provide reasonable details to Sellers regarding the status of the Remedial Actions. In conducting any Remedial Actions, Buyer may use risk-based remediation standards allowed under applicable Environmental Laws consistent with the Commercially Reasonable Remediation Cost. 

   

 Section 13.4 _Remedies_.

 (d) Regardless of the failure of Sellers to include any relevant information in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or any supplement thereto, to the extent that Sellers can demonstrate that Buyer had Knowledge of any information that should have been disclosed in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or any supplement thereto, such information shall not form the basis for a claim pursuant to _Article XIII_ of this Agreement or otherwise give rise to any claim on the part of Buyer.
