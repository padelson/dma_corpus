_AGREEMENT_

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, and
warranties herein made, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE TRANSACTION

1.01 _Basic Transaction_.

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Buyer shall purchase, acquire, and accept from the Seller,
and the Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, convey, and deliver to the Buyer
all right, title, and interest in and to all of the Purchased Securities, free
and clear of any and all Liens.

 

1.02 _Purchase Price_. __

 

Subject to the adjustments set forth in this _ARTICLE I_ , the aggregate
consideration for the Purchased Securities will be an amount of cash equal
to (a) __ the Purchase Price, plus (b) __ the Cash Amount, minus (c) __
the Debt Amount, minus (d) __ the Transaction Expenses Amount, minus (e) __
the amount by which Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target,
if any, plus (f) __ the amount by which Working Capital is greater than the
Working Capital Target, if any (the " _Closing Payment_ ").

 

(a) _Closing Payment_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall:

 

(i) Pay the Seller the Estimated Closing Payment; and

 

(ii) Pay, on behalf of the Seller, the Companies, and their respective
Subsidiaries, the Transaction Expenses Amount (other than any portion thereof
that is payable following the Closing).

(b) _Payments_. All payments to the Seller pursuant to this _Section
1.02_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

1.03 _Estimated Closing Payment_. Not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a written
statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_") that shall set forth the Sellers
good faith estimate of (a) the Cash Amount, (b) the Debt Amount, (c) the
Transaction Expenses Amount, (d) Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working
Capital_ ") and based on the Estimated Working Capital, the Working Capital
Surplus, if any, or the Working Capital Deficit, if any, and (e) based on the
foregoing clauses (a)-(d), the Closing Payment (the " _Estimated Closing
Payment_ "). The Pre-Closing Statement and the calculations contained therein
will be prepared in good faith by the Seller from the Books and Records of
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and the definitions contained herein. The Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in its review of the Pre-Closing
Statement and shall consider in good faith any comments the Buyer may have
thereon. The Seller shall redeliver an updated Pre-Closing Statement one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and all Closing Date payments to be
made under _Section_ __ _ 1.02(a)_ shall be calculated using such updated
Pre-Closing Statement.

 



-6- 

    

1.04 _Closing Payment Determination_.

 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As promptly as possible, but in any event within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the Seller an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time together with a
statement setting forth the Buyers good faith calculation of (i) the Working
Capital and the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any,
(ii) the Cash Amount, (iii) the outstanding amount of all Debt, (iv) the
Transaction Expenses Amount, and (v) based on the amounts set forth in
clauses (i)-(iv), the Closing Payment (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

 

(b) _Objections_. After delivery of the Closing Statement by the Buyer,
the Seller and its Representatives shall be permitted to make written
inquiries of the Buyer and its Representatives regarding questions, concerns,
or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof. If the Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement,
then the Seller will deliver to the Buyer a written statement (an " _Objection
Statement_ ") setting forth each particularized disputed or objected item (the
" _Objection Disputes_ ") to the Closing Statement including the basis for
such dispute or objection and the Sellers proposed resolution of each such
Objection Dispute. Any component of Buyers Closing Statement that is not the
subject of an Objection Dispute set forth in the Objection Statement shall be
final and binding on the Parties and will be the basis for the adjustments
described in _Section 1.06_. If an Objection Statement is not delivered to
the Buyer within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement
by the Seller, then the Closing Statement as originally received by the Seller
shall be final, binding, and non-appealable by the Parties. If an Objection
Statement is timely delivered within such forty-five (45) day period, then
the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
Objection Disputes within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement (as such thirty (30) day period may be extended pursuant to the
mutual written agreement of the Seller and the Buyer, the " _Negotiation
Period_ ") (and all such discussions and communications related thereto that
occur during such period shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence and any applicable similar state Law unless otherwise specified in
a writing by the Seller and the Buyer). If, during the Negotiation Period, the
Seller and the Buyer are able to resolve any Objection Disputes in written
statement jointly executed by the Buyer and the Seller, then such agreed upon
amounts shall become final, binding, non-appealable, and conclusive on the
Parties and not subject to further appeal or collateral attack.

(c) _Independent Auditor_. If the Buyer and Seller do not reach a final
resolution of each Objection Dispute within the Negotiation Period, then
Seller and the Buyer shall retain and submit each unresolved Objection Dispute
to (A) Plante Moran, and (B) if Plante Moran is not available or is not
independent at such time, an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon
by the Buyer and the Seller (the " _Independent Auditor_ ") to resolve such
Objection Disputes. Each of the Buyer and the Seller agrees to execute a
customary joint engagement letter with respect to Independent Auditor, in a
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such parties. The Independent
Auditor shall be instructed to promptly resolve any unresolved Objection
Disputes and, in any event, to make its determination in respect of such
Objection Disputes in writing within thirty (30) days following its retention.
Except as expressly set forth herein, neither the Buyer nor

 



-7- 

    

 the Seller shall have or conduct any communication, either written or oral,
with the Independent Auditor without the other Party either being present (or
having waived or declined its right to be present) or receiving a concurrent
copy of any written communication. The Buyer and the Seller may furnish a
single written statement of their position with respect all of the Objection
Disputes (the " _Initial Submissions_ ") to the Independent Auditor within
twenty (20) days following the Independent Auditors retention. The Initial
Submissions shall be strictly limited to the Objection Disputes that remain in
dispute and that have not been resolved in writing by the Buyer and the
Seller prior to submission of the dispute to the Independent Auditor, and with
regard to any Objection Dispute, Buyer shall not be entitled to submit to the
Independent Auditor a value for such disputed item that is more favorable
to Buyer than that value set forth on the Closing Statement and the Seller
shall not be entitled to submit to the Independent Auditor a value for any
such Objection Dispute that is more favorable to the Seller than the value set
forth in the Objection Statement. The Independent Auditor shall forward a
copy of each applicable partys Initial Submission to Buyer and Seller, as
applicable. Within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of such initial
twenty (20) day period, the Buyer and the Seller may deliver to the
Independent Auditor a single written response to the other Partys Initial
Submission (the " _Written Responses_ "), which Written Responses the
Independent Auditor shall forward to the Buyer and the Seller, as applicable.
The Buyer and the Seller, and their respective Representatives, shall
reasonably cooperate with the Independent Auditor during its engagement and
respond on a timely basis with information or access to documents or
personnel reasonably requested by the Independent Auditor, all with the intent
to fairly and in good faith resolve all Objection Disputes as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Parties shall be entitled to have a judgment
entered on the final written report provided by the Independent Auditor in
any court of competent jurisdiction. In resolving any particular Objection
Dispute, the Independent Auditor (1) may not assign a value to any particular
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either the
Buyer or the Seller, or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by
the Buyer or the Seller in their respective Initial Submissions, (2) shall be
bound by the principles set forth in this Agreement, (3) shall act as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, and (4) shall limit its review to matters
specifically set forth in the Initial Submissions and Written Responses. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Independent Auditor be entitled
to make any adjustment to the Net Working Capital Target. The Independent
Auditor shall conduct its determination activities in a manner wherein all
materials submitted to it are held in confidence and shall not be disclosed to
third parties. The Independent Auditors determination of such Objection
Disputes shall be final and binding upon the Parties, absent Fraud or manifest
error. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall initially be
borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty
percent (50%) by the Seller, on the other hand; _provided_ , that such fees
and expenses shall ultimately be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the aggregate
portion of the contested amount as set forth in each Partys Initial
Submissions not awarded to each Party bears to the aggregate amount actually
contested by such Party. The Independent Auditor shall include a calculation
of the portion of their fees and expenses to be paid by each of the Seller and
the Buyer in its final written determination delivered pursuant to this
_Section 1.04(c)_. The final Closing Statement, however determined pursuant
to this _Section 1.04_, will produce the Working Capital Surplus or Working
Capital Deficit, if any, and the Cash Amount, the Debt Amount, and the
Transaction Expenses Amount, in each case, to be used to determine the final
Closing Payment.

(d) The Seller and Buyer hereby agree (i) that the consideration paid by
Buyer for the purchase of Equity Securities of MedData Holding is seventy
percent (70%) of the aggregate Purchase Price, and that the consideration paid
by Buyer for the purchase of Equity Securities of MedDirect Holding is thirty
percent (30%) of the aggregate Purchase Price, (ii) that the consideration
paid for the purchase of the Equity Securities of MedData Holding shall be
allocated among the assets of MedData Holding and its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 1.04(d)_ (the "
_Allocation Statement_ "), and (iii) to take consistent positions with respect
to the Purchase Price allocation in the foregoing clause (i) and the
Allocation Statement for all U.S. federal, state and local income Tax
purposes except as otherwise required by applicable Law

1.05 _Preparation of Closing Statement; Cooperation_.

(a) _Preparation of Closing Statement_. The Closing Statement
(including the calculation of the Closing Payment and each of the components
thereof) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and definitions contained in this Agreement, except that the
Closing Statement (including the calculations of Working Capital and the Cash
Amount) shall: (i) not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment
arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (ii) be based on facts and circumstances as they exist prior
to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or event
occurring on or after the Closing.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, employees, consultants, accountants, and agents to, reasonably
cooperate with the Seller and its Representatives in connection with its
review of the Closing Statement and the preparation of the
Objection Statement and upon prior written notice or request by the Seller,
to provide (without undue interruption to the operations of any of the
Companies, and during normal business operations) (i) copies of such
information as may be reasonably requested by the Seller that were actually

or other duty or obligation and to preserve attorney-client privilege and
thereafter, the Seller Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide such information in a manner that would not

client privilege).

 



-42- 

    

6.06 _Exclusivity_. During the Interim Period, the Seller shall not, and
shall direct the Companies, their respective Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, and other

and its Representatives). In the event that any Person (other than the Buyer)
offers to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning any Acquisition
Proposal, the Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer of the identity of such
Person and the material terms of such offer. [***].

 

6.07 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that as
of the date hereof, and continuing through the Closing Date, the Parties and
each of their respective Affiliates, employees and advisors are and remain
bound to the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in effect until
the Closing, at which point it will automatically terminate.

6.08 _Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate
the Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitments (including any "flex" provisions in any fee letters entered into
in connection therewith), as applicable, no later than the Closing Date,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments (subject to Buyers right to replace, restate,
supplement, modify, assign, substitute or amend the Debt Commitment Letter
solely in accordance with the terms of this _Section 6.08_) until the funding
of the Financing at the Closing, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments on terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments
(including any "flex" provisions in any fee letters entered into in connection
therewith) or on other terms that would not constitute a Restricted Debt
Commitment Letter Amendment (such definitive agreements being referred to as
the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), no
later than the Closing Date, all conditions applicable to the Buyer contained
in the Financing Commitments (or the Financing Agreements) that are within its
control including, without limitation, the payment of any commitment,
engagement or similar fees thereunder as required as a condition to the
Financing as and when they become due and payable, and (iv) upon satisfaction
of such conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section 2.02_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing (assuming the Closing were to occur at such time), but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments prior to or substantially
concurrently with the Closing. The Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably
informed

 



-43- 

    

 upon written request on a reasonable basis of the status of the Financing.
The Buyer shall give the Seller written notice within two (2) Business Days
(i) of any event that would materially delay or make funding on the Closing
Date less likely to occur, (ii) of any breach by any party to the Financing
Commitments (that would permit any other party thereto to terminate any such
Financing Commitment) or any cancellation or termination of any Financing
Commitment for any reason, in each case, of which it becomes aware, (iii) of
the receipt, on or prior to the Closing Date, of any notice or other written
communication from any financing source (including any Debt Financing Source,
as applicable) with respect to any actual, threatened or alleged breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments
or any Financing Agreement or any material dispute or disagreement
between the Buyer, on the one hand, and such financing sources, on the other
hand, with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing at Closing or the
amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, or (iv) if for any reason the
Buyer believes in good faith it is likely that it will not be able to obtain
all or a portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments to
the extent such inability would result in insufficient funds necessary to pay
the Required Amount.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), replace, amend, supplement, modify or waive any provision of the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent such replacement, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver (i) would reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing such that the Buyer would not have sufficient proceeds to permit the
Buyer to pay the aggregate amount of the applicable Financing to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Required Amount_ ")
or (ii) would impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise expand the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or the Financing Agreements in
a manner that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
Closing (the amendments, supplements, modifications, waivers or replacements
in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Restricted Debt
Commitment Letter Amendments_ "); _provided_ , that, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 6.08(b)_, the Buyer may replace,
amend, supplement, modify or waive any Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent
not prohibited by this _Section 6.08(b)_) (including to add
additional agents, co-agents, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed such
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, together with any conforming or
ministerial changes related thereto, but only if the addition of such parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a
Restricted Debt Commitment Letter Amendment). Upon any such replacement,
amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver under, the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 6.08_ the term " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced,
amended, supplemented, modified or waived and the term " _Debt Financing_ "
as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Debt Financing
contemplated by any such Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended,
supplemented, modified or waived. The Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) deliver to the Companies true and correct copies
of any termination, amendment, restatement, modification, supplement, waiver,
substitution or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter and, if executed
prior to the Closing, the Debt Financing Agreements.

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be terminated prior to the Closing for any reason not
in accordance with this Agreement 

 



-44- 

    

 (other than due to the failure to satisfy a condition to the consummation of
the Debt Financing resulting from a breach of any Specified Acquisition
Agreement Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter),
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller
in this Agreement or of a condition to Buyers obligations to close the
transactions set forth in _Section 2.02_), and to the extent other sources
of debt or equity are not then available, then Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") from alternative sources of debt financing in an amount, when
added to the portion of the Equity Financing, the Debt Financing still
available, if any, other available sources of debt or equity, and cash on
hand, sufficient to pay the Required Amount, which Alternative Financing would
not (i) involve terms, conditions and costs that are less favorable to the
Buyer than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and/or any fee
letters entered into in connection therewith, or (ii) involve any conditions
to funding the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof. The Buyer shall keep Seller informed upon
request on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange such Alternative Financing and shall, upon request,
provide true and correct copies of all documents related to the Alternative
Financing. The obligations under _Sections 6.08(a)_ and _(b)_ and _Sections
6.09(a)_ and _(b)_ shall apply equally to any such Alternative Financing.

6.09 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Seller agrees to use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause
each of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives
to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide such cooperation as the Buyer
may reasonably request in connection with the Debt Financing, including with
respect to (i) having senior management assist in preparation for and
participation in a reasonable number of lender marketing meetings and calls
and a reasonable number of other due diligence sessions with prospective
lenders and ratings agencies in each case in connection with obtaining the
Debt Financing, including direct contact between such senior management and
the Debt Financing Sources and other potential lenders in the Debt Financing,
(ii) promptly providing pertinent and customary documentation and information
regarding the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries (including
information required under "know your customer", beneficial ownership and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations at least three (3) Business Days
in advance of Closing; provided a written request from the Debt Financing
Sources has been made to either Company at least ten (10) Business Days in
advance of the Closing), including then-available financial statements and
financial projections, the Required Information and other pertinent financial
information regarding the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by the Buyer in order to consummate the Debt Financing
or that is customarily needed for financings of the type contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, including for the avoidance of doubt, information to
enable the Buyer to prepare pro forma financial statements, giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and in each case, other than
information for which the Companies are dependent on information to be
provided by the Buyer, unless such information is provided to the Companies by
the Buyer in a timely and reasonable fashion), (iii) assisting in making
arrangements for, the pledge of collateral and the granting of security
interests in connection with the Debt Financing, to the extent required for
closing under the Debt Commitment Letter and subject to any funds certain
provisions contained therein, including the execution and delivery of
documents in connection with the pledge and perfection of liens and security
(including customary pledge and security documents, control agreements,
mortgages, currency or interest hedging arrangements or 

 



-45- 

    

 other customary definitive financing documents, surveys, and title
insurance) and the providing of guarantees supporting the Debt Financing and
related documentation, including customary officers certificates, perfection
certificates, schedules, documents and instruments and a solvency certificate
from the chief financial officer or equivalent of the Companies in the form
attached as Annex I to Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter and other
customary documents as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, (iv) causing
the taking of corporate (or similar) actions by the Companies reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Debt Financing, subject to
the occurrence of the Closing, (v) assisting in the preparation of and
execution and delivery of the definitive documents with respect to the Debt
Financing, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, (vi) permitting
representatives of the prospective Debt Financing Sources to conduct
commercial field examinations, inventory and intellectual property appraisals,
Phase I environmental assessments and an appraisal of the owned real property,
and making audits and appraisals delivered for the purposes of any credit
facility available to the Buyer for purposes of the Financing, (vii) promptly
following any request by the Buyer, delivering all necessary notices and other
information required under the Existing Credit Facility to arrange for the
termination of any guarantee and Lien, as applicable, executed and delivered
by the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries under the Existing Credit
Facility and (viii) cooperating with the Buyer in order to satisfy on
a timely basis the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses, (A) neither the Seller,
any of the Companies nor any of their respective Representatives shall be
required to pay (or agree to pay) any commitment or other fee prior to the
Closing or provide any indemnities or incur any liability or enter into any
agreement in connection with the Debt Financing (other than agreements entered
into and liabilities incurred by the Companies that only become effective
upon the consummation of the Closing), (B) no personal liability shall be
imposed on the Representatives of the Seller or any of the Companies involved,
and (C) the Seller and the Companies and their respective officers and
employees shall not be required to take any action that would unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the business of the Companies or require any
director, officer or employee of the Seller or the Companies to execute any
solvency certificate or similar document that becomes effective prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer (i) shall reimburse the Companies (upon delivery of
reasonably detailed back up information) for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Companies in connection with the
cooperation contemplated by _Section 6.09(a)_ and (ii) shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller, the Companies, their respective Affiliates and their
respective directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents from
and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under _Section 6.09(a)_ and any information used in connection
therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the Companies or
their Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Companies (and not the
Buyer) shall be responsible for (1) fees payable to existing legal, financial
or other advisors of the Companies with respect to services provided prior to
the Closing, (2) any ordinary course amounts payable to existing employees of
or consultants to the Companies or any of their Affiliates with respect to
services provided prior to the Closing and (3) any amounts that would have
been incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby regardless of the Debt Financing.

 



-46- 

    

(c) The Companies and the Seller hereby consent to the reasonable use of
all of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries logos, names and
trademarks in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos,
names and trademarks shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries, or their reputation or goodwill.

ARTICLE VII 

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

 

7.01 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, upon the reasonable
request of the other Party and at such Partys expense, each of the Buyer and
the Seller shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver, or cause to be executed,
acknowledged, and delivered, all such further documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions as the requesting
Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if following the Closing, any right,
property, asset or liability not forming part of the Business is found to
have been transferred to the Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in error (for example, in cases where such right, property or
asset relates to the Excluded Businesses but was inadvertently transferred to
the Companies), either directly or indirectly or otherwise in preparation for
the separation of the Business from the Seller prior to Closing, the Buyer
shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) to transfer, at no cost to
the Seller, such right, property, asset or liability as soon as practicable to
the Seller. If, following the Closing, any right, property, asset or
liability forming part of the Business is found to have been retained by the
Seller in error (for example, in cases where such right, property, asset or
liability relates to the Business but was inadvertently retained by the
Seller), either directly or indirectly (including in preparation for the
separation of the Business from the Seller), the Seller shall transfer, at no
cost to the Buyer, such right, property, asset or liability as soon as
practicable to the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, indicated by Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Shared Agreement or Parent-Level Agreement
will be transferred to the Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

 

7.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Buyer shall not,
and shall not permit the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal, or modify any provision of the Organizational Documents of the
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any Persons who, prior to the Closing, have served as
officers, directors, or managers of the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") (unless
required by Law), in each case, to the extent that any such amendment, repeal
or modification would result in terms that are materially less favorable to
the DandO Indemnified Persons than as are in effect as of the date hereof.

 

(b) At the Closing, the Companies will obtain fully prepaid "tail" policies
under each of the Companies existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Closing, (ii) covers only those DandO Indemnified Persons who are currently
covered by each of the Companies existing directors and

 



-47- 

    

 officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and only for matters occurring at or prior to the Closing, and (iii)
contains coverage terms comparable to those applicable to the current
directors and officers of each of the Companies (the " _D andO Tail Policy_").
The Buyer will, and will cause each of the Companies to, maintain the DandO Tail
Policy in full force and effect during its full term.

7.03 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, subject to
applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries solely for purposes of (i) the enforcement of rights by
such Party under this Agreement (including, among other things, any insurance
claims by, Proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental investigations
of the Seller or the Buyer or any of their Affiliates, any evaluation of any
claim for indemnification hereunder or in order to enable the Sellers or the
Buyer to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and
each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby),
(ii) the preparation of any Tax Return or the examination by any Taxing
Authority or other action relating to any Tax Return of such Party, or (iii)
the preparation of financial reports to, provide the Seller and its
Representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to the Books and Records of each of
the Companies with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
all such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries respective business and shall be subject to
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party
may destroy or otherwise dispose of any Books and Records of the Companies, or
any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date at any
time in their sole and absolute discretion; _provided_ , that prior to such
destruction, such Party shall first give reasonable prior written notice to
the other Party and if the other Party so requests within forty-five (45)
days after receipt of such notice, to take possession of such Books and
Records or such portions thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of this
_Section 7.03_ to the contrary, no such access shall be permitted or
provision of documentation shall be required to the extent that it would
require any Party to disclose information subject to attorney-client
privilege, violate any Law, or conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which any of the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is bound; _provided_ , the Companies shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner that does not
violate any such Law, confidentiality obligations or privilege.

7.04 _Intercompany Obligations and Arrangements_.

 

(a) The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such action
and make such payments as may be necessary so that prior to or concurrently
with the Closing, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall settle, discharge, offset,
pay, repay in full, terminate or extinguish all intercompany loans, notes and
advances (collectively, " _Intercompany Balances_ ") regardless of their
maturity, including any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date
of payment, for the amount due. The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer all
promissory notes or other instruments evidencing such Intercompany Balances
marked "cancelled" including any global intercompany note executed
in connection with the Sellers Existing Credit Facility.

 



-48- 

    

(b) The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions
as may be necessary to terminate, concurrently with the Closing, all Affiliate
Arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 7.04(b)_ shall not
apply to (i) any Affiliate Arrangement set forth in  _Section 7.04(b) of the
Disclosure Schedules_, (ii) any Contract between a third party, on the one
hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, to which the
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries is not a party, but under
which the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries may otherwise
derive benefits (" _Parent-Level Agreements_ "), such as enterprise-wide
licenses or "master" agreements, (iii) any Contract among (x) a third party,
(y) the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries) and (z) the Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (" _Shared Agreements_ "), or (iv) this Agreement or any Related
Agreement.

(c) With respect to each Parent-Level Agreement set forth on  _Section
7.04(c) of the Disclosure Schedules_, the Parties shall cooperate in good
faith and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
occur, on or prior to the Closing, (i) an amendment, (ii) a separation, (iii)
the execution of a comparable Contract or (iv) other action (each a " _Parent-
Level Agreement Replacement_ "), such that the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries continue to derive substantially comparable use and benefit of
such Contract as was in place before such amendment, separation, execution of
a new Contract or other action; _provided_ , that none of the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to compensate any third party, commence
or participate in litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial

or benefits under any Parent-Level Agreement or Shared Agreement.

Authority regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of any of the Companies or their

or delayed).

 

(c) _Election to Reduce Basis in Shares_. Seller shall make a timely and
valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A)

circumstances existing or arising prior to the Closing Date, which the Seller
Releasors can, shall or may have against the Buyer Released Parties, whether
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, unanticipated as well as
anticipated (collectively, the " _Seller Released Claims_ "), and hereby
irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim
or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any suit, action, or
proceeding of any kind, in any court or before any tribunal, against any
Buyer Released Party based upon any Seller Released Claim. Each of the Seller
Releasors acknowledges and agrees that it shall not initiate any Proceedings
or otherwise make any claims against the Buyer Released Parties by reason of
the fact that such Person was a stockholder, member, director, manager
officer or employee of any Company or was serving at the request of any
Company as a director, manager, officer or employee of another entity (whether
such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.06_, no

respective directors, officers and employees, to reasonably cooperate with
such other Party and its Representatives in the prosecution, contest and/or
defense of such Proceeding, including by making available its personnel,
witnesses and Representatives, providing such testimony and access to its
books and records and entering into a mutually agreeable joint defense
agreement (which shall provide for, among other things, the treatment of
privileged communications and control of such Proceeding), in each case as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest
and/or defense of such Proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any Joint Litigation Matter shall be controlled by either the
Seller (or one of its Affiliates), on the one hand, or the Buyer (or one of
its Affiliates) on the other hand,

 



-51- 

    

 based on whether the underlying act, circumstance, event, act, omission or
other matter upon which such Joint Litigation Matter is based is primarily
related to the Business or the Excluded Business, and any such non-
controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such
prosecution, contest and/or defense with counsel of its own choosing. Each

directly or indirectly, engage in any Restricted Business and not to acquire,
invest in, operate or control any Person that engages in the Restricted
Business; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit the Seller or any of
its Affiliates from (i) being a passive owner of less than three percent (3%)

(b) During the Restricted Period, the Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
not to (and to cause Mednax, Inc. and any of its Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, controlled by Mednax, Inc. not to), anywhere in the Restricted
Area, directly or indirectly, (x) induce, or attempt to induce, any customer,
supplier, distributor, licensor or other business relation of the Companies
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries to cease doing business with, or
reduce its business with, the Companies and/or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, provided, that this clause (x) shall not prohibit Seller,
Mednax, Inc. or their affiliates from soliciting any customer, supplier,
distributor, licensor or other business relation that is not related to the
Restricted Business or (y) in any way intentionally interfere with the
relationship between any such customer, supplier, distributor, licensee,

respective Subsidiaries (including intentionally making any negative

respective Subsidiaries, or their respective products or services).

(c) During the Restricted Period, the Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees not to (and to cause its Affiliates not to), anywhere in the Restricted
Area, directly or indirectly (x) divert, solicit, induce or attempt to divert,

its respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Restricted Employee,
on the other hand, or (y) hire any Restricted Employee. The foregoing
restrictions shall not preclude general solicitations in newspapers or similar
mass media not targeted towards a particular Restricted Employee; _provided_ ,
that no Restricted Employee that responds to any such general solicitation
may be hired without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

 

(d) The Seller hereby agrees with the Buyer that the Seller will not, and
that the Seller will cause its Affiliates and other Representatives not to,
at any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, disclose or use any information
confidential or proprietary information involving or relating to any of the

 



-52- 

    

 Companies or their respective Subsidiaries or the Buyer and their respective
Affiliates (collectively, " _Confidential Information_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the information subject to the foregoing provision of this
sentence will not include any information generally available to, or known by,
the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof) at the
time of disclosure by the Seller;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
provisions of this _Section 7.08(d)_ will not prohibit any retention of
copies of records expressly required by applicable Law or bona fide document
retention policy in existence prior to the date hereof (which retained copies
shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this _Section
7.08(d)_ or disclosure (a) required by applicable Law ( _provided_ , that in
such case, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with prompt written notice of
such requirement prior to disclosure thereof and shall, upon request therefor
by the Buyer, reasonably cooperate with the Buyer and its Subsidiaries to
obtain a protective order or other remedy) or (b) required to be made in a
forum of proper jurisdiction and venue in connection with the enforcement of
any right or remedy under this Agreement.

 

(e) The Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions
contained in this _Section 7.08_ are essential in order to effectuate the
transfer of the goodwill of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to
the Buyer and that the Buyers remedies for a breach or other failure to
comply with the restrictions contained in this  _Section 7.08_ are not
intended to be limited by reference to the value of any amount explicitly
assigned by the Parties as specific consideration for the restrictions
contained in this _Section 7.08_ (or any portion thereof) or otherwise. The
Seller acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the
applicable provisions of this _Section 7.08_, monetary damages will not
constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of any
such breach, the Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance and/or
injunctive or other relief, in addition to all other remedies available at law
or equity, in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of
this  _Section 7.08_ (without posting a bond or other security); _provided_
, that, (i) to the extent any such breach is capable of being cured within
twenty (20) Business Days, the Buyer shall provide written notice to the
Seller of any such violation or breach and the Seller shall have an
opportunity to cure such breach within the twenty (20) Business Days after the
date on which such written notice has been delivered and (ii) in the event of
a breach of any of the applicable provisions of this _Section 7.08_ that is
not cured within such twenty (20) Business Day period, the Restricted Period
shall be tolled until the date on which such breach ceases to be continuing
and in effect, in order that the Buyer, the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries shall have all of the agreed-upon temporal protection provided in
this _Section 7.08_. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
character or duration of the provisions of this _Section 7.08_ are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on the conduct of the Seller that are reasonable in light
of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to the Buyer the benefits
of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce all of the separate covenants of this  _Section 7.08_ because taken
together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to the Buyer the
intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the Parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the
remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such Proceeding, shall be
deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such Proceeding, from this Agreement.
The Seller acknowledges that during its ownership of the Companies and its
respective Subsidiaries, the Seller has become familiar with the trade secrets
of and other Confidential Information concerning the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries. Therefore, in further consideration of the
compensation to be paid to the Seller under this Agreement, the

 



-53- 

    

 Seller agrees to the covenants set forth in _Section 7.08_ and acknowledges
that (w) the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.08_ are reasonably
limited in time and in all other respects, (x) the covenants set forth in
this _Section 7.08_ are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Buyer,
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, (y) the Buyer would not have
entered into this Agreement but for the agreement of the Seller to the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.08_ and (z) the covenants set forth
in this _Section 7.08_ have been made in order to induce the Buyer to enter
into this Agreement.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of
this  _Section 7.08_ shall not apply to (i) any Parent Acquirer or any of
its Affiliates (other than Mednax, Inc. and any Affiliates directly or
indirectly controlled by Mednax, Inc.) or (ii) to any Person from or after
such time that such Person is not controlled directly or indirectly by
Mednax, Inc. (including any Person that ceases to be controlled by Mednax);
_provided_ , _however_ , the terms of clause (c) of this _Section 7.08_ shall
apply, to the extent applicable, to any Parent Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates (other than Mednax, Inc. and any Affiliates directly or indirectly
controlled by Mednax, Inc.) in respect of Restricted Key Employees; _provided_
, _further_ that if Parent Acquirer is an investment fund, such restrictions
shall not apply to such investment fund (so long as it is not directing Mednax
or its Subsidiaries to take any actions in violation of clause (c) of _Section
7.08_) or any other portfolio companies thereof. For purposes of this
_Section 7.08_, the term "control" shall mean the power, authority or ability
of Mednax to, directly or indirectly, cause the applicable entity to comply
with the applicable terms of this _Section 7.08_.

(g) In the event that Seller or its Affiliates acquire all or any part of,
or invest in, a business or Person that is engaged in the Restricted
Business, then such conduct shall not, by itself, constitute a violation of
_Section 7.08(a)_ or _(b)_ so long as (x) such acquired business or
Persons revenues in respect of such Restricted Business activities represent
no more than twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate consolidated revenues of
such acquired business or Person, as applicable, for such acquired businesss
or Persons most recently completed fiscal year and (y) such Restricted
Business activities are divested, wound-down or otherwise discontinued within
twelve (12) months of the date of such acquisition.

 

7.09 _A andM Project_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Companies to complete the project currently being undertaken by
Alvarez and Marsal to make operational improvements the patient pay service line
of the Companies and shall reasonably consult with Seller with regard to the
completion of such project. Seller shall reimburse the Company for the fees
and costs paid to Alvarez and Marsal to complete such project promptly following
provision of appropriate documentation by the Companies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the Companies be obligated to incur and Seller
be obligated to reimburse, fees arising after the Closing in excess of $[***]
(the " _Expense Reimbursement Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event Seller fails or refuses to make any reimbursement of fees (including as
a result of reaching the Expense Reimbursement Cap, then Buyer shall have no
further obligation to continue any such operational improvements hereunder.

shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Companies no to, take
any action following the Closing that results in liability to the Seller under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or
any similar state or local Law.

7.11 _Retention Bonuses_. The parties acknowledge and agree that a portion
of the Retention Bonus Obligations may become due and payable by the
Companies or their Subsidiaries on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Retention Bonus Date"). From time to time following the Retention
Bonus Date, if it is determined by the Buyer that all or any portion of the
Retention Bonus Amount applicable to any Retention Bonus Recipient shall not
become due and payable to such Retention Bonus Recipient in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Retention Bonus Agreement of such Retention Bonus
Recipient (including, to the extent applicable, as a result of such Retention
Bonus Recipient ceasing to remain employed with the applicable employer
thereof), then the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller, the
applicable portion of the Retention Bonus Amount that has not become payable
to such Retention Bonus Recipient(s) (together with any related employers
share of payroll, employment, or other Taxes associated with such payments
that were included in the Retention Bonus Obligations but which did not
actually become paid or payable).

10.02 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule and Exhibits attached hereto), the Related Agreements, and other
documents delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto, contain the
entire understanding of the Parties in respect of their subject matter and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings (oral or written) between
the Parties with respect to such subject matter, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule, and Exhibits constitute a
part hereof as though set forth in full above. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the execution of this Agreement is
the culmination of extensive negotiations between them, all of which were
intended to be non-binding upon the Parties until memorialized in the executed
copy of this Agreement and none of which should be construed as having
created any type of oral agreement between the Parties.

 

10.03 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.

10.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties shall
pay their own fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, and performance of this Agreement, including their own
counsel fees.

 

10.05 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
supplemented, canceled, or discharged, except by written instrument executed
by all of the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, _Section 10.06_, _Section 10.09_,
_Section 10.10(a)_,  _Section 10.20_, _Section 10.21_ and this _Section
10.05_, in each case together with any related definitions, may not be
modified, amended, supplemented, canceled or discharged in a manner that is
materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the written consent
of the Debt Financing Sources specified in clause (a) of the definition
thereof. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder
preclude the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. No waiver of
any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding
or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any waiver
be implied from any course of dealing between the Parties. No extension of
time for performance of any obligations or other acts hereunder or under any
other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the time for
performance of any other obligations or any other acts.

Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their

nothing expressed or implied herein or therein shall be construed to give any
other person any legal or equitable rights hereunder. Except as expressly
provided herein, the rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be
assigned by the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Buyer may make a collateral assignment of
its rights hereunder to any Debt Financing Source or any other lender to the
Buyer without the prior written consent of the Seller or any other Person.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of _Section 10.05_, _Section 10.09_, _Section 10.10(a)_,
_Section 10.19_, _Section 10.20_ and this _Section 10.06_, in each

_Section 10.09_, _Section 10.10(a)_, _Section 10.19_, _Section 10.20_ and
this _Section 10.06_, in each case and any related definitions, will be
enforceable by the Debt Financing Sources.

counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

this Agreement to an article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit,

Any item or matter required to be disclosed on a particular Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed where required by the terms of
this Agreement for any other Disclosure Schedule to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face of such

information; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to the representations and warranties set forth in any _Section 5.04_
(Financial Statements), _Section 5.06(a)_ (Absence of Certain Developments),
_Section 5.16_ (Affiliate Transactions), or any Fundamental Representation
which, in each case, shall be qualified solely and exclusively by disclosures
upon the face of the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedule relating
to such representations and warranties. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement is
not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, are or are not required to be disclosed, and neither Party
shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or
controversy with any Party as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described 

 



-60- 

    

 herein or included in a Disclosure Schedule hereto is or is not required to
be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required to be
disclosed as material). The information contained in the Disclosure Schedule
is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach
of any agreement.

10.09 _Governing Law; Interpretation_. All matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that all actions, matters or Proceedings
(whether at law, in contract or in tort) involving any Debt Financing Source
that may be based upon, arise out of or relating to any Debt Financing, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of any documentation (including the Debt
Commitment Letter) in connection therewith shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

10.10 _Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction_.

(a) Any Proceeding against the Buyer or the Seller, arising out of, or with
respect to, this Agreement or any judgment entered by any court in respect
thereof shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in
Wilmington, Delaware (the " _Designated Courts_ "), and the Parties accept the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Designated Courts for the purpose of any suit,
action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Party hereto agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort, or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the

(b) In addition, each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or Proceeding arising out of

Courts and hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any suit, action
or proceedings brought in the Designated Courts has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

10.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 10.11(b)_ and _10.11(c)_ , each of the Parties
agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that the Buyer and the Seller would be
irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of the Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other
remedy to which a non-breaching Party may be entitled at Law, a non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without the posting of any
bond to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions hereof. Each Party further waives any defense that a
remedy at Law would be adequate in any action for specific performance or
injunctive relief hereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the right of the Seller to seek specific performance or other
appropriate form of equitable remedy, in each case, prior to the Closing, with
respect to causing the Buyer to consummate the Closing, and in connection
therewith, to force the Buyer to cause the equity financing to be funded ("
_Closing Specific Performance_ "), shall be available if (and only if) each of
the following shall have been satisfied: (i) all conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE II_ (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied other than at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to the benefit
thereof if the Closing would have occurred on such date and the actual
satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or
waived by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof as of the Closing Date if
the Closing would have occurred pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, (ii)
the Buyer and shall have failed to consummate the Closing by the date
required under _Section 2.01(a)_ and the Seller has delivered to Buyer a
Closing Failure Notice, (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is also funded at the Closing
on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) the Seller has
irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted and
the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will
occur on the terms contemplated in this Agreement and (v) the Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing on the earlier to occur of the third (3rd) Business Day
after the Buyers receipt of such notice described in clause (iv) above and
the second (2nd) Business Day preceding the Outside Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (x) no
person other than the Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
this Agreement against the Buyer; (y) none of the Seller, the Companies, their
respective Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or
any Representatives of the Buyer to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter; and (z) in no event shall any Company Related Parties, collectively
or individually, be entitled in respect of any action, non-action, matter or
event to both (A) a grant of Closing Specific Performance and (B) any monetary
damages, including all or any portion of the Buyer Termination Fee;
_provided_ , that the remedies described in (A) and (B) can be sought in the
alternative prior to the termination of this Agreement.

Person with respect to such estimates, projections or forecasts.

10.14 _Confidentiality; Publicity_. Except as may be required by Law, or
as otherwise permitted or expressly contemplated herein, no Party or its

the employees, customers, or suppliers of the Companies and their respective

-64- 

    

10.16 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule, Exhibits, and Schedules attached hereto), the Related Agreements,
and each other agreement or instrument entered into in connection herewith or
therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a portable document
format (.pdf), or similar reproduction of such signed writing using electronic
mail shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any Party or to any such agreement or instrument, each other Party
hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of an electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of electronic mail as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a Contract and each such party forever waives any such
defense.

 

10.17 _Representation of the Companies_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees
that, McDermott Will and Emery LLP has served prior to the Closing as counsel
to the Seller, on the one hand, and the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery, and Closing of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby the (" _Prior Representation_ "), McDermott
Will and Emery LLP may serve as counsel to the Seller, in connection with any
litigation, claim, or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including claims for indemnification, disputes relating to post-
closing adjustments, and disputes involving other agreements entered into in
connection with this Agreement) or the Related Agreements (a " _Subsequent
Representation_ ") notwithstanding such Prior Representation and each of the
Parties consents, and waives any conflict of interest arising from, such
Subsequent Representation based on such Prior Representation, and each of such
Parties shall cause any controlled Affiliate thereof to consent to waive
every conflict of interest. Each of the Buyer and the Companies, for its and
such respective Representatives, acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between any of the Companies and McDermott Will and Emery LLP
made in connection with Prior Representation (the " _Privileged
Communications_ ") that, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to
be privileged communications of the Companies and its counsel and would not
be subject to disclosure to the Buyer in connection with any process relating
to a dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, any Related
Agreement, or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing and for all purposes
be deemed to be privileged communications between the Seller and such counsel
and neither the Buyer nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
the Buyer shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications, belongs to the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries, and not the Seller. In addition, the Buyer will
not, and will cause each of its Affiliates (including following the Closing,
the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) not to, use any Privileged
Communications in any dispute between the Sellers or its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand. Upon and after
the Closing, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall cease to
have any attorney-client relationship with McDermott Will

 



-65- 

    

 and Emery LLP with respect to the Prior Representation. Any such
representation of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries by McDermott
Will and Emery LLP after the Closing will not affect the foregoing provisions
hereof.

10.18 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any action or Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, the Related Agreements, or the negotiation, execution, or
performance thereof may only be made against the Persons or entities that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligation set forth herein, with respect to such party. No past, present or
future Representative or any of their successors or permitted
assigns (together the " _Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall have any liability
for any obligations or liabilities of any Party hereto under this Agreement or
for any claim or Proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contract, Non-Party
Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 10.18_.

 

10.19 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DESCRIBED IN _SECTION 10.18_ OR IN RESPECT OF THE
DEBT FINANCING, INCLUDING ANY LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS  _SECTION 10.19_. A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 10.19_ MAY BE SUBMITTED TO
ANY COURT AS EVIDENCE OF THE CONTENT THEREOF.

 

10.20 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) neither any Party nor any of their
respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers, directors, employees
and representatives, nor any Person claiming by, through or under any such
Person, shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the Financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) no Debt Financing Source
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any
Party or any of their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers,
directors, employees and representatives, or any Person claiming by, through
or under any such Person for any obligations or liabilities of any party
hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment

 



-66- 

    

 Letters or the performance thereof or the Financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter as set forth therein or to the Financing Agreements
as set forth therein.

 

10.21 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will
be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties,
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
Person by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

10.22 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed
as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.
