Buyer than that value set forth on the Closing Statement and the Seller shall not be entitled to submit to the Independent Auditor a value for any such Objection Dispute that is more favorable to the Seller than the value set forth in the Objection

be entitled to make any adjustment to the Net Working Capital Target. The Independent Auditor shall conduct its determination activities in a manner wherein all materials submitted to it are held in confidence and shall not be disclosed to third
parties. The Independent Auditor&#146;s determination of such Objection Disputes shall be final and binding upon the Parties, absent Fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall initially be borne and paid fifty
percent (50%) by the Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty&nbsp;percent&nbsp;(50%) by the Seller, on the other hand; <U>provided</U>, that such fees and expenses shall ultimately be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage which the aggregate portion of the contested amount as set forth in each Party&#146;s Initial Submissions not awarded to each Party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such Party. The Independent Auditor
shall include a calculation of the portion of their fees and expenses to be paid by each of the Seller and the Buyer in its final written determination delivered pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.04(c)</U>. The final Closing Statement, however
determined pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.04</U>, will produce the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, and the Cash Amount, the Debt Amount, and the Transaction Expenses Amount, in each case, to be used to determine the
final Closing Payment. </P>
