representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
sufficiency of which is acknowledged and agreed, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(in such capacity, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in _Article II_. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
" _DGCL_ ").

   

1.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the
offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York
10153, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days, following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived
of each of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if
the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), the Closing shall occur on the
earliest to occur of (A) a date during the Marketing Period specified by
Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days written notice to the Company
or (B) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the final day of
the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ for the Closing as of the
date determined pursuant to this proviso) or (ii) at such other place and
time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree
in writing (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day of
the year on which banks are not required or authorized by Law to close in New
York City.

 

(b) " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the period of fifteen (15) consecutive
Business Days after the date hereof ( _provided_ that (x) the Marketing
Period shall not commence prior to the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, (y) November 23, 2018 shall not be considered
a Business Day and (z) if the Marketing Period has not ended prior to
December 19, 2018, such period shall not be deemed to have commenced until
January 2, 2019) beginning on the date on which Parent shall have received all
of the Required Information from the Company. Notwithstanding anything in
this definition to the contrary, the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to
have commenced if, after the date hereof and prior to the completion of such
fifteen (15) consecutive Business Day period: (i) the Companys independent
auditor shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any financial
statements forming part of the Required Information for which they have
provided an opinion, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with
respect to the financial statements of the Company for the applicable periods
by the independent auditor or another nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent or such withdrawn
opinion is reinstated by the Companys independent auditors or (ii) the
Company issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any
historical financial statements of the Company, in which case the Marketing
Period shall be deemed not to commence unless and until such restatement has
been completed and the relevant Required Information has been amended or the
Company has announced that it has concluded that no restatement is required
in accordance with GAAP. If at any time the Company shall reasonably believe
that it has provided the Required Information, the Company may deliver to
Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed
such delivery), in which case the requirement to deliver the Required
Information will be deemed to have been satisfied on the date of such delivery
specified in such notice, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes
the Company has not completed the delivery of the Required Information and,
within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice from the
Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
reasonable specificity which portion(s) of the Required Information the
Company has not delivered or are otherwise unsuitable), following which the
Marketing Period will commence as soon as the Company delivers to Parent such
specified portion of the Required Information.

Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at

any of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-entry
account formerly representing any uncertificated Shares (" _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time , Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares), an aggregate amount of cash comprising approximately the
amounts required to be delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ in
respect of Shares (such aggregate amount of cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) such investments shall be an
obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks and (ii) no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount
of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 4.1(a)_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or caused to
be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. No later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable
terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than Excluded
Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_). Upon the
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in immediately available
funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each
case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) equal to the cash amount that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if
the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably acceptable to the Paying
Agent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean
any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent. Any holder
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any
payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __
_ 4.2(e)_), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately
prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration
shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article IV_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) had such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger
and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and (ii) deliver the cash that such holder is entitled to
receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_), without interest thereon.

4.3 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive cash pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_ unless and until
the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under
the DGCL, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only
the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned
by such Dissenting Shareholder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent under Section 262 of the
DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall finally determine that the
Dissenting Shareholder is not entitled to relief provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated as
though such Shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest and less any
required Tax withholding. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written
notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received
by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

 

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, in each case issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects
of such event on the Merger Consideration.

 

4.5 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, with respect to each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the

April 23, 2013 and the Companys 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the
" _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, (i) if the exercise
price of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being
payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect and (ii) if
the exercise price of such Company Option is less than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled as

payment in the amount equal to (i) the number of Shares underlying the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii)
the Merger Consideration _minus_ the applicable exercise price (the product of
(i) and (ii), the "Option Payment"). The Option Payment (if any) payable
under this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_ to each former holder of a Company Option
that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid

unit (a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that was granted under the
Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall terminate and be
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the
right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) the number of Shares
underlying such Company Restricted Stock Unit, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger
Consideration. Following the Effective Time, no such Company Restricted Stock
Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to

Surviving Corporations payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 4.2(f)_.

 

(c) _Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units_. Each outstanding
performance restricted stock unit (a " _Company Performance Stock Unit_ ")
that was granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
shall terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment
equal to (i) with respect to Company Performance Stock Units for which the
period during which the performance vesting requirement is measured has been
completed, (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company Performance Stock
Unit that would vest based on the actual level of achievement as of the

Performance Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Company
Performance Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this _Section_ __ _
4.5(c)_ in exchange for such Company Performance Stock Unit in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_. The consideration payable under this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_ to each former holder of a Company Performance Stock

partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Applicable Date, there has not
been any change, effect, circumstance or development which has had or would,

Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2018 and through the date of this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past
practice in all material respects and there has not been any action taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time without Parents consent, would constitute a violation of,
or would require the consent of Parent under  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_(i),
(ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xiv), (xvi), or (xviii).

_Proceedings_ "), pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors, officers, or employees in their capacities as such,
except for those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no obligations
or liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not

obligations disclosed, reflected, reserved against or otherwise provided for
in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2018 and

Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,

any Governmental Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate,

Company to consummate the Merger.

Company, circumstances do not exist that are likely to result in the loss of
the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.

Material Adverse Effect.

 

(vii) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no claims (other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course) or litigation pending or threatened in
writing relating to the Company Plans, except as would not, individually or in

(viii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

benefits) becoming due to any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (B) materially increase any benefits under any Company Plan,
(C) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of

accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other
forward-looking information furnished to them (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, business
plans and other forward-looking information), and that Parent and Merger Sub
will have no claim against the Company or any of its stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other
Representatives with respect thereto.

bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors, not to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including
by way of furnishing any non-public information) any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) enter into, engage in, continue or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (A) regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal;

 



45

    

(iii) provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company or

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately (1) cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal and cease providing any information to any
such Person or its Representatives and (2) terminate all access granted to any
such Person and its Representatives to any physical or electronic dataroom, in
each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to request
the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from granting such a
waiver, in each case, to the extent necessary to comply with fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, prior to the time, but
not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may, in

not result from a breach (other than any breach that is both immaterial and
unintentional) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, (i) provide access to non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person
who made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such information has
previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the time such
information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any
such material non-public information, the Company receives from the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the
Confidentiality Agreements terms are on Parent (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an
Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and
only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above,
the Companys board of directors determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then available
and after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-
four (24) hours) notify Parent if (i) any written or other bona fide
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or that
would be reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received

 



46

    

 by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested from the
Company in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or that would be
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any discussions
or negotiation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or that would be
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with the Company, indicating, in connection with such
notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations.

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal, offer, inquiry or
indication of interest from any Person or group (as defined in or under
Section 13 of the Exchange Act) relating to a merger, consolidation,
dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
share exchange, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or similar

or more of the outstanding Shares, or twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the Company and (ii)
any acquisition (whether by purchase, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition) by any Person or group (as defined in or under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act) resulting in, or proposal, offer, inquiry or indication of
interest, which if consummated would result in, any Person becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Shares, or
twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
total assets (measured by market value thereof) of the Company, or any tender
offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%)
of the Shares, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

" _Intervening Event_ " means a material effect that (i) was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, the board of directors of the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which effect, or any material consequence
thereof, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the board of
directors of the Company prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote
and (ii) does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal; in each case other than
(A) any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal that could
lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (B) an effect resulting from a breach of this
Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) changes in the price
of the Shares, in and of itself (however, the underlying reasons for
such changes may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded by any other
exclusion in this definition); or (D) the fact that, in and of itself, the
Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or
expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself (
_provided_ , _however_ , the underlying reasons for such events may constitute
an Intervening Event unless excluded by any other exclusion in this
definition).

" _Representatives_ " means, with respect to any Person, such
Persons directors, officers and employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors.

 



47

    

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a third
party (not made as a result of a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (other than
any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional)) after the date of this
Agreement that, if consummated, would result in such third party (or
its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
outstanding Shares (or of the stock of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or a majority
of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which
the Companys board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) to be (i) more
favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than the
Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of, and the
likelihood of completion of, such proposal and this Agreement (including, if
applicable at the time of such determination, any changes to the financial
terms of this Agreement then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(g)_, the
Companys board of directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, change,
amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within

declare advisable or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions
described in clause (i) through clause (vii) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_,
a "Change in Recommendation") or (viii) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, lease agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ entered into in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement")
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(f) _Fiduciary Exception to Change in Recommendation
Provision_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.2(e)_, following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the
Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (other than any breach that is both immaterial and
unintentional) and that the Companys board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Companys board of
directors may, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)(ii)_, or authorize,
resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, if all of the
following conditions are met:

 



48

    

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent three (3) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the
material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the
consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making
the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an
unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other
documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period) and (3) that,
subject to clause (ii) below, the Companys board of directors has determined
to make a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ in order to enter into the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable and (B) prior to making such
a Change in Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, as applicable, (x) used commercially reasonable
efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
engage) during such notice period, which may be on a non-exclusive basis, to
consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) in determining whether to make a
Change in Recommendation or to effect a termination in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the board of directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any
other information provided by Parent in response to such notice; and

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined, in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised
terms proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation
or to so terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_,
as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(g) _Change in Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, upon the occurrence of any Intervening
Event, the Companys board of directors may, at any time prior to the time the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation if all of
the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent three (3) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change
in Recommendation and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below,
the Companys board of directors has determined to make a Change in
Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, used
commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent wishes to engage) during such three-Business Day period to
consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the failure of the Companys board of directors to
make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in
accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



49

    

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by
Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _
6.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(h)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Companys board of directors
to make a Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.2(g)_.

 

6.3 _Information Supplied_. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Company shall prepare and file (and the Company shall use reasonable efforts
to file within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) with
the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary
form relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to
the SEC with respect to any comments received on the Proxy Statement by the
SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as
promptly as possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the
Proxy Statement.

(b) No filing of, or amendment, response or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon (other than any filing, amendment or supplement
in connection with a Change in Recommendation). The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to
the extent not readily publicly available. Parent shall (i) furnish all
information required by the Exchange Act concerning it and its Affiliates to
the Company, (ii) provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of
information to be included therein and (iii) otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the
resolution of any comments received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement such that the Proxy Statement
would not (A) include any misstatement of a material fact or (B) omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then (x) the party that makes such discovery shall promptly
notify the other party and (y) the Company shall prepare (with Parents
reasonable assistance) and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement the stockholders of
the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the

 



50

    

 SEC or the staff of the SEC (the " _Staff_ ") and of any request by the SEC
or the Staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the Staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or the Merger. No response to any comments from the SEC or the Staff relating
to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, _unless_ made pursuant
to a telephone call initiated by the SEC. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

6.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and use its
reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Shares to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ "). Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_,
the Companys board of directors shall (i) include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (ii) recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting
that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and (iii) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive
proxies representing the Company Requisite Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present or (B) it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting. In
addition, notwithstanding the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_,
the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a
manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders of the
Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter
(other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to
be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of
this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company
shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination
of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without
the Parents prior written consent, unless required by applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the
Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event
later than the Termination Date including (i) preparing and filing (x) within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the notifications,
filings and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act, and (y)
as promptly as practicable and advisable in the case of all other filings
required under any Foreign Competition Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby) and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or
any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) satisfying the conditions to

the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_, in the event that the parties receive

any other Antitrust Laws including a Request for Additional Information (a "
_Second Request_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, the parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to,
and to certify compliance with, such Second Request as promptly as
practicable and advisable, and counsel for both parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. None
of the parties, including their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall
knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit to take, any action
which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent
consummation of the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by
the parties. None of the parties, without the other parties prior written
consent, shall (i) enter into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or
otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of
extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or
termination of the waiting period applicable to the contemplated transactions
under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws, or (ii) enter into any timing or
similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that
would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or that would otherwise prevent
or prohibit the parties from consummating the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act
of 1914, the HSR Act and all other federal, state and foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws and Orders that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws
and the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any
Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination
Date. No party hereto or its counsel shall independently participate in any
substantive call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without first giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of
such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
the opportunity to attend and participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall notify the
other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or
substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to
make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject
of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or
making any such communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other
party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider
in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such

such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party
with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or
inquiry and (iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry,
hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any
Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating
thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and
Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.5_ may be reasonably redacted as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns or to comply with applicable Law.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, each of the parties, including their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, hereto shall use its best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or
effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_, "best
efforts" shall include taking any and all actions (such actions, the "
_Regulatory Actions_ ") necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits,
waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity
required to consummate the Merger as expeditiously as possible, and in no
event later than the Termination Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate, and other
disposition of the businesses, assets, products or equity interests of the
Company or any of Parents or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other
businesses, assets, products or equity interests now owned or hereafter
acquired by Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) creating,
terminating, or amending any existing relationships, ventures, contractual
rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to any action that
would limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, products or
equity interests of Parent or the Company (including any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates); _provided_ that such Regulatory Actions are
conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective Time.

 



53

    

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.

 

(f) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement and any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.

 

6.6 _Access; Consultation_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, afford Parent and its
Representatives, and the Lenders and their Representatives, reasonable access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees, customers, suppliers,
properties, assets, commitments, Tax Returns, books, records and Contracts
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to such Representatives of Parent all information
concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries capital stock, business and
personnel as may reasonably be requested by such Representatives of Parent;
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company or Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing shall not
require either the Company or Parent to permit any invasive environmental
sampling or any inspection or to disclose any information pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, to the extent that in the reasonable good faith judgment
of the Companys outside legal counsel: (i) any applicable Law requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party or (iii) legal counsel disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ that with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to (1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such
inspection or disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to 

 



54

    

 providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company and (3) in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures,
redaction (solely to the extent necessary, as reasonably determined by the
Companys outside legal counsel) or entry into a customary joint defense
agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties
determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such
privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the other party. All requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be directed to an executive
officer of the Company or Parent, as applicable, or such Person as may be
designated by any such executive officer. Each of Parent and the Company, as
it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate competitively
sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or
with similar restrictions. Such material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or
otherwise as the restriction indicates, and shall be subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the information or
material furnished pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or otherwise in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and
mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to,
and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such
material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that
is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense
doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under applicable Law
and, to the extent identified, shall cooperate in taking commercially
reasonable actions or practices and other customary actions to reduce the
risks related to such actions where the failure to remediate would reasonably
be likely to result in substantial fines or penalties.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, after becoming aware, give prompt
written notice to one another of (i) any change, effect, circumstance or
development that would reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), (ii) any
reasonably likely failure of any condition to Parents or the
Companys obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable), (iii) any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
notification under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect the representations
or warranties of the notifying party or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder.

6.8 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to

national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ, (ii) any

continues to remain employed with the Company or its Subsidiaries (a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2019 or, if earlier, termination of employment
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), be provided with (i) a base salary or base
wage and target annual cash incentive opportunity that is no less favorable
than the base salary or base wage and target annual cash incentive opportunity
in each case provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (other than incentive compensation (other than as described above)
and equity-compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent.
Additionally, Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2019, be
provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and assume all obligations
under employment agreements and severance plans listed on _Section_ __ _
6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to
Continuing Employees under the benefit plans provided for those employees
except to the extent such condition or exclusion was applicable to an
individual Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect to
the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Parent plan in which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate following the Closing Date.

 



56

    

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide credit (without duplication) to Continuing Employees

Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the compensation
and benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, including for purposes of accrual of vacation, paid time off and
severance entitlements to the same extent as such service was credited under
the Company Plans, _provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

(d) Prior to making any written or material prepared oral communications to
the officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining
to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with a
copy of the intended communication, (ii) Parent shall have a reasonable period
of time to review and comment on the communication and (iii) the Company shall
consider, in good faith, modifying any such communications to incorporate
Parents comments.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and neither any current or former employee, nor
any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the extent provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.8_), no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does,

their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or

such individual or legal representative any rights under or with respect to
any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by this
Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be entitled
to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for
his or her rights thereunder.

 

6.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 6.15_ and _8.5_ ,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses incurred in connection with
the filing fee for the Proxy Statement and printing and mailing the Proxy
Statement shall be borne by the Company.

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Company determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective 

 



57

    

 Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another Person prior to the Effective Time, in each case, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under the Laws of the State of Delaware,
any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).
Parent shall ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation shall, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at
any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such
Indemnified Party as provided herein.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_
that in no event shall the Company be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, or
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies,
an annual premium amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and,
_provided_ , _further_ that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



58

    

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.11_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be in addition to any rights such
individual may have under the Laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable
indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws.

 

(e) Neither of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.12 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

6.13 _Control of the Company_ __ _s or Parent_ __ _s Operations_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision of its operations.

 

6.14 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
(and shall be permitted to) take all actions as may be reasonably requested
by any party hereto to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including any derivative securities with respect to any equity
securities of the Company) by each individual who is a director or officer of
the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

6.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the
earlier of the Closing Date and the date this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms (the " _Pre-Closing Period_"), subject to the
limitations set forth below, and unless otherwise agreed by Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Parent as reasonably requested by Parent and as is customary for
financings of the type contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter
and the Debt Commitment Letter, and at Parents sole expense (other than with
respect to the preparation or obtaining and delivery of the Required
Information), in connection with Parents arranging and obtaining the
Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (including, without
limitation, to the extent reasonably requested and customary for financings
of the type contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter, cooperation of the type more fully described below);
_provided, however_ , that such cooperation does not: (i) require (other than
to the extent contemplated by clause (v) below) the entry by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries into any agreement or commitment that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time and that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Effective Time, (ii) unduly interfere with the normal
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) include any actions that
the Company reasonably believes would (A) result in a violation of any
Contract (including the Contracts listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) (the " _Existing Credit Facilities_ ") or
confidentiality agreement or any Law, or the loss of any legal or other
privilege, (B) conflict with or violate the Companys organizational documents
or (C) cause any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation in
this Agreement to be breached or any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to
fail to be satisfied, (iv) involve consenting to the pre filing of UCC-1s or
any other grant of Liens or other encumbrances prior to the Closing, (v)
except for the delivery of customary Authorization and Representation Letters
as expressly provided below, require the giving of representations or
warranties to any third parties, or require the indemnification of any third
parties, (vi) require the waiver or amendment of any terms of this Agreement
or the payment of any fees or reimbursement of any expenses prior to the
Closing for which the Company has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by Parent, (vii) cause any director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability, including that none of the board of directors or similar managers
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any
resolutions or take any similar action approving the Financing that take
effect prior to the Closing (and no such director or similar manager that is
not continuing in such role following the Closing shall be required to enter
into any such resolutions or take any such similar actions) or (viii) require
the delivery of any projections or pro forma financial information or delivery
of any financial statements in a form or subject to a standard different than
those provided to Parent on or prior to the date hereof. Subject to the
foregoing limitations, such cooperation will include using its commercially
reasonable efforts (A) to promptly furnish Parent with audited financial

to each Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and Debt Commitment Letter on the
terms and conditions contained therein (giving effect to any "flex" provisions

efforts to obtain, and shall cause VVC Holding Corp. to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, alternative financing for any such portion from the same or

any termination or repudiation or threatened termination or repudiation, in
each case by any party to a Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing of any provisions of any Commitment Letter or such

any event described in subsections _6.15(a)(i)-(viii)_ , could subject any
trustee, director, manager, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Affiliates to any actual or potential personal liability, or the Company or
Subsidiaries to make any payment or clear any Permitted Liens prior to

_ 8.3(a) _(Parent Breach) or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ (Failure to Close), or
(y) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ (Termination
Date) and at the time of such termination the Company could have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ (Parent Breach) or
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ (Failure to Close), then, in either case, Parent shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of
same day funds an amount equal to $312,635,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_
").

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Parent
Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as
and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, shall not constitute
a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. The parties acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall either the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee or Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, as
the case may be, on more than one occasion.

(f) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered
into this Agreement; and accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay
promptly any amount that may become due pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b),_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.5(d)_ (any such amount due, a
" _Payment_ "), and, in order to obtain such Payment, Parent or the
Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or
Parent, respectively, for the applicable Payment, or any portion thereof, the
party with such judgment against them shall pay to the other party its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the Payment at the prime rate
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
such Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of full
payment thereof.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the provisos in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent has the right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee, except in the case of Willful
Breach by the Company, the payment of the Company Termination Fee and, if
applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.5(f)_ shall be deemed to be liquidated damages (and not a penalty)
and shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent Related Parties
against the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents or any of their respective
assignees or successors (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or
other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of
any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement (except that the Company remains obligated to
pay to Parent and Merger Sub any amount due and payable pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.5(f)_), whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, while

 



70

    

 Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance and
the payment of the Company Termination Fee (in each case in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement), under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger
Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
and the Company Termination Fee.

 

(h) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with this Agreement, the payment to the Company of the Parent
Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company
pursuant to _Sections 6.10_ , _6.15(g)_ and _8.5(f)_ , shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages (and not a penalty) and, except for the right to
seek specific performance in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and any other Person against Parent, the Equity Investors, the
Preferred Equity Financing Related Parties and the Debt Financing Related
Parties and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, representatives,
agent or any of their respective assignees or successors or any former,
current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling Person,
manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative,
agent, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (the " _Parent Related
Parties_ "), and no Parent Related Party shall have any other liability for
any or all losses suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Preferred
Equity Financing, the Debt Financing, the Merger (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination regardless of
whether any such termination or abandonment was as the result of a willful or
intentional breach by any Parent Related Party, and neither the Company nor
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim,
action or proceeding against Parent or any other Parent Related Party arising
out of this Agreement, the Preferred Equity Financing, the Debt Financing, the
Merger or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (in each case in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and any money damages, including all or any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_, Parent and Merger Sub shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent the same
becomes payable in accordance with this Agreement.

transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this

occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of
the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, and including to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to
make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including _Article I_ and
_Article IV_ ) by a decree of specific performance, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving
actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants
required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement
(including _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated
by this Agreement, including  _Article I_ and _Article IV_ ) in addition to
any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity,
including the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and seek money damages in accordance

 



78

    

 therewith. Each party further agrees that it shall not take any position in
any legal proceeding concerning this Agreement that is contrary to the terms
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.13_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and each of
their respective Affiliates to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.13(a)_ and subject to the last sentence
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.13(b)_, it is explicitly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letters to fund the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and consummate the Closing only in the event that (i) all conditions
in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing) and Parent fails to consummate the Merger on the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (ii) the financing
provided for by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt
Commitment Letters (or, if Alternative Financing is being used in accordance
