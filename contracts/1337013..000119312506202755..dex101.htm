shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a consistent basis with the
Company Financial Statements.

(b) Upon receipt from the Buyer, the Seller shall have thirty (30) calendar
days to review the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "). If the Seller
disagrees with the Buyers computation of the Closing Working Capital, the
Seller may, on or prior to the last calendar day of the Review Period,
deliver a notice to the Buyer (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets
forth its objections to the Buyers calculation of the Closing Working
Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with
which the Seller disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed written
explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount,
and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall set forth the Sellers
calculation of the Closing Working Capital based on such objections. To the
extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, the Seller shall be deemed to
have agreed with the Buyers calculation of all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement. 

(c) Unless the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection to the Buyer within the
Review Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Buyers
calculation of the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Statement shall be
final, conclusive and binding. If the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection
to the Buyer within the Review Period, the Buyer and the Seller shall, during
the thirty (30) calendar days following such delivery or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the
amount of the Closing Working Capital. If, at the end of such period or any
mutually agreed extension thereof, the Buyer and the Seller are unable to
resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their
disagreements for final determination to an independent accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller (or, if the Buyer and the
Seller cannot agree on such an accounting firm, then each shall select an
independent accounting firm and such accounting firms shall select a third
independent accounting firm) (the accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the
Buyer and the Seller or such other accounting firm being the " _Independent
Expert_ "). The Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the Independent Expert
promptly to review this Section 2.4 and to determine solely with respect to
the disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to what extent, if
any, the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement requires
adjustment. The Buyer and the Seller shall make available to the Independent
Expert all relevant books and records and other items reasonably requested by
the Independent Expert for this purpose. The Buyer and the Seller shall
request that the Independent Expert deliver to the Buyer and the Seller, as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than forty-five (45) calendar
days after its retention, a report that sets forth its resolution of the
disputed items and amounts and its calculation of the Closing  



 

11  Working Capital. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be borne by the parties in inverse proportion to
their success on the disputed matters as determined by the Independent Expert.
Each of the Buyer and the Seller agrees to promptly execute, if requested by
the Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary
indemnities in favor of the Independent Expert.

Section 2.5 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

(a) If the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.4 (the " _Final Working Capital_ "), is less than the Target Amount, the
Seller shall pay to the Buyer or the Company, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.5(b), an
amount of cash equal to the difference between the Target Amount and the
Final Working Capital (the " _Deficit Amount_ "). If the Final Working Capital
exceeds the Target Amount, the Buyer or the Company shall pay to the Seller,
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.5(b), an amount of cash equal to the difference between
the Final Working Capital and the Target Amount (the " _Surplus Amount_ ").

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working Capital has been
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4, (i) if there is a Deficit Amount,
the Seller shall pay to the Buyer or the Company an amount equal to such
Deficit Amount and (ii) if there is a Surplus Amount, the Buyer or the Company
shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such Surplus Amount, in each case
above together with interest calculated as set forth below. Any payment of a
Deficit Amount or a Surplus Amount shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Buyer
or the Seller, as the case may be, at least three (3) Business Days prior to
such payment. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section
2.5 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding
the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate", as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect from time to
time or (if less) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law, during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty five (365)
days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding.

with this Section 6.2(b).

(c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Buyer or the Company, for a period of seven years after the
Closing or, if shorter, the applicable period specified in the Sellers
document retention policy, the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records
relating to the Company relating to periods prior to the Closing which shall
not otherwise have been delivered to the Buyer and (ii) upon reasonable
notice, afford the Representatives of the Buyer reasonable access (including
the right to make photocopies at the Buyers expense), during normal business
hours, to such books and records; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
shall notify the Buyer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days in
advance of destroying any such books and records prior to the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date in order to provide the Buyer the opportunity
to take possession of or copy such books and records in accordance with this
Section 6.2(c).



 

35 Section 6.3 _Update of Disclosure Schedules; Knowledge of Breach_.

(a) Each party (it being understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Section 6.3, the Seller and the Company shall be deemed to be one party, and
the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall be deemed to be the other party) shall
each, from time to time prior to the Closing, supplement or amend (promptly
after discovery thereof) by written notice delivered to the other party
its Disclosure Schedules (each, an " _Update_ ") with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or discovered which if existing or known at the date of this
Agreement would have been required to be set forth or described in such
partys Disclosure Schedules and also with respect to events or conditions
arising after the date hereof and prior to the Closing which would cause any
representation or warranty of such amending party contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate. Any such supplemental or amended disclosure shall
be deemed to have cured, as of the twentieth (20th) calendar day from the date
of such Update or, if the party not providing the Update elects to proceed
with the Closing and the Closing occurs, the Closing Date, any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement solely for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a), in
the case that the Buyer and/or the Acquisition Sub is the updating party, or
Section 9.3(a), in the case that the Seller and/or the Company is the updating
party; _provided_ , that (i) no Update shall be deemed to have cured any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes
of the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII, (ii) upon receipt
of an Update by any party, written notice may be provided within the twenty-
day period set forth in the immediately preceding sentence by the Seller
pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i), if the Buyer and/or the Acquisition Sub is the
updating party, or by the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(ii), if the Seller
and/or the Company is the updating party, if the non-updating party
elects not to waive the matter(s) contained in the Update, and termination of
this Agreement is otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms set forth in
Article X and (iii) in the event such twenty-day period, beginning upon
delivery of an Update, extends past the Termination Date, the Termination
Date shall automatically be extended to be the last day of such twenty-day
period.

(b) If prior to the Closing, (i) the Seller and/or the Company shall have
actual knowledge that any breach of a representation or warranty of the Buyer
and/or the Acquisition Sub has occurred (other than through notice from the
Buyer or the Acquisition Sub), the Seller or the Company shall promptly so
notify the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub, in reasonable detail and (ii) the
Buyer and/or the Acquisition Sub shall have actual knowledge that any
breach of a representation or warranty of the Seller or the Company has
occurred (other than through notice from the Seller or the Company), the Buyer
or the Acquisition Sub shall promptly so notify the Seller and the Company, in
reasonable detail. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no notice delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) shall constitute a waiver of any rights of the
notifying party pursuant to Article VII or Article X and (ii) upon receipt of
a notice pursuant to this Section 6.3(b), the receiving party may provide an
Update pursuant to Section 6.3(a).

Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Seller shall give prompt notice to the Buyer of (i) any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, has resulted or is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any condition precedent set forth in
Article IX or (ii) any notice or other communication from any  



 

36  third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_
  _however_ , that except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3(a), (A) the
delivery of any notice by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) shall not
limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the Buyer or prevent
or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by
the Seller or the Company and (B) disclosure by the Seller pursuant to this
Section 6.4(a) shall not be deemed to amend or supplement any Disclosure
Schedule or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty.

(b) If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event relating to the
Company or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered
by the Company which should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly inform the Buyer and cooperate in the
preparation of any required supplement to the Proxy Statement.

(c) The Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Seller of (i) any fact, event
or circumstance known to it that individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, has resulted or is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any condition precedent set forth in
Article IX or (ii) any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein; _provided however_ ,
that except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3(a), (A) the delivery of any
notice by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.4(c) shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the Seller or prevent or cure any
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by the Buyer and
(B) disclosure by the Buyer pursuant to this 6.4(c) shall not constitute an
exception to any representation or warranty.

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, each of the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall not, and it shall
cause its Affiliates not to, for a period of two years thereafter, without
the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), directly or indirectly solicit
(other than a solicitation by general advertisement) the employment or
engagement of services of, any person who is or was employed as an employee,
contractor or consultant by the Company or the Seller during such period on a
full- or part-time basis. The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, this Section 6.5 shall replace and supersede
the no solicitation provisions set forth in the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of May 3, 2006, between the Buyer and the Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and that subject to Section 6.6 below, all
other terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect. Each of the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub agrees that any
remedy at law for any breach by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub of this
Section 6.5 would be inadequate, and that the Seller and the Company would be
entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this
restriction on the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub is too onerous and is not
necessary for the protection of the Company and the Seller, the Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such
lesser restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or
appropriate properly to protect the Company and the Seller.



 

37 Section 6.6 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the Buyers obligations with respect to the
Proxy Statement, each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished
to it by or on behalf of the other parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the
parties under this Section 6.6(a) shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
terminate in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the Seller. If for any
reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

(b) From and after the Closing, the Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates
to, hold, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Company, except as contemplated by
any Ancillary Agreement or necessary to file Returns and other reports to
Governmental Authorities, including, without limitation, the SEC, and except
to the extent that the Seller can show that such information (i) is in the
public domain through no fault of the Seller or any of its Affiliates or (ii)
is lawfully acquired by the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing
from sources which are not known by the Seller to be prohibited from
disclosing such information by any legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.
If the Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is compelled to
disclose any such information by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of Law, the Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer in
writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and shall disclose only
that portion of such information which the Seller is advised by its counsel is
legally required to be disclosed, provided that, if requested by the Buyer,
the Seller shall, at the Buyers expense, exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

Section 6.7 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and the Promissory Note Documents as promptly
as practicable, including to (i) finalize and agree upon the definitive
Promissory Note Documents, (ii) obtain from Governmental Authorities and other
Persons all consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as
are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (iii) promptly make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. Each
party shall cooperate with and promptly furnish information to the other party
necessary in connection with any requirements imposed upon such other party in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.
Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall furnish to each others counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in  



 

38  connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that may be
necessary under the HSR Act and any other antitrust, competition, or trade
regulation Laws.

(b) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The Buyer acknowledges that, in order for it to operate the Business as
it had been operated prior to the Closing, the Buyer may be required to apply
for and obtain a new Medicare supplier number from the relevant Governmental
Authority for the Company subsequent to the Closing. The Seller and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Buyer in
obtaining such Medicare supplier number.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the Companys and the Sellers
undertaking pursuant to Section 6.2(a), the Company and the Seller shall, and
shall request each of their respective Representatives to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub in
connection with the Buyers or the Acquisition Subs efforts to obtain
financing alternative to, or to replace, the Financing, including (i)
requesting the Sellers independent accountants to provide reasonable
assistance to the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub at the Buyers expense, (ii)
requesting the Sellers attorneys to provide reasonable assistance to the
Buyer or the Acquisition Sub at the Buyers expense, (iii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain landlord waivers, mortgagee waivers, bailee
acknowledgements and other similar third-party documents required by the
financiers providing such financing and (iv) executing and delivering any
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
requested certificates or documents.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and none of the parties shall issue any press release or make any public
statement prior to obtaining the other parties written approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except
that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement of any party hereto.



 

39 Section 6.9 _Release of Guarantees_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the Seller
or its Affiliates that are a party to each of the guarantees, performance
bonds, bid bonds and other similar agreements listed in Schedule 6.9 of the
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Guarantees_ "). In the event any of the
Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing, the Buyer will provide
the Seller at the Closing with a guarantee that indemnifies and holds the
Seller and its Affiliates that are a party to each such Guarantee harmless
for any and all payments required to be made under, and costs and expenses
incurred in connection with, such Guarantee by the Seller or its Affiliates
that are a party to such Guarantee until such Guarantee is released.

Section 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company (the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, fines, costs and expenses
(including actual attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out
of or relating to any threatened or actual Action, based in whole or in part
upon or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of the Company, whether pertaining to
any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after the Closing Date (the " _D andO
Indemnified Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part upon, or arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the
full extent the Company is permitted under applicable Law and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws as in effect as of the date hereof to indemnify its
own directors or officers (and the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company
to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to
each DandO Indemnified Party to the extent permitted under applicable Law and
the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof, provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking in writing to repay such advances if it is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to
indemnification). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
Action, is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising before
or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel
satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, and the Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to, pay all fees and expenses of such
counsel for the DandO Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are
received to the extent permitted under applicable Law and the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, provided
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking in
writing to repay such advances if it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (ii) the
Buyer, the Company and each DandO Indemnified Party will use all reasonable
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter; _provided,_ that neither
the Company nor the Buyer shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 6.10 shall promptly notify the Buyer upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (but
the failure so to notify shall not relieve a  



 

40  party from any liability which it may have under this Section 6.10 except to
the extent such failure prejudices such party). The parties hereto agree that
all rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to
advances of expenses incurred in defense of any such Action existing in favor
of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the
Closing Date shall continue in full force and effect until the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that if any Action (whether arising
before, at or after the Closing) is made against any DandO Indemnified Party on
or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing and such DandO Indemnified
Party provides notice to the Buyer in accordance with this Section 6.10, the
provisions of this Section 6.10 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation.

(b) Each of the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub covenants, for itself and its
successors and assigns, that it and they shall not institute any action or
proceeding in any court or before any administrative agency or before any
other tribunal against any of the current directors of the Company, in their
capacity as such, with respect to any liabilities, Actions or causes of
action, judgments, claims or demands of any nature or description
(consequential, compensatory, punitive or otherwise), in each such case to the
extent resulting from their approval of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(c) The Company shall not take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm
or adversely affect the provisions of the articles of organization and bylaws
and any other written agreements of the Company that provide indemnification
of and expense reimbursement to any DandO Indemnified Party. 

Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the individuals who
are actively employed by the Company on the Closing Date (the " _Affected
Employees_ "), for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
compensation and employee benefits, which, in the aggregate, are not less
favorable than those currently provided by the Company to the Affected
Employees, determined without regard to equity incentive compensation and
retention bonuses provided to the Affected Employee prior to the Closing. From
and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Company to honor the
Company Employee Plans in accordance with their terms. Nothing contained
in this Section 6.11 shall be construed as requiring the Buyer or the Company
to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment
of any specific person, or prevent the Buyer or the Company from modifying or
terminating any Company Employee Plan, or otherwise modifying the terms and
conditions of an Affected Employees employment.

(b) To the extent that the Affected Employees become eligible to participate
in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, the Buyer shall cause the Affected Employees to
receive credit for all periods of employment and/or service with the Company
(including service with predecessor employers, where such credit was provided
by the Company) prior to the Closing Date for all purposes (except for benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan), to the extent such credit does
not result in a duplication of benefits. The Buyer shall and shall cause the
Company to honor all  



 

41  unused vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days accrued by the
employees of the Company under the policies and practices of the Company.

(c) The Buyer shall cause all welfare benefit plans (including medical,
dental, life insurance, and short- and long-term disability benefit plans) in
which Affected Employees participate following the Closing to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees and their covered dependents under such plan (except to the extent
that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
Companys plans as in existence prior to the Closing) and (ii) provide
each Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such plans.

(d) The Seller shall assume, and the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall have
no responsibility for, any and all liabilities of the Company to pay bonuses
under any Company Employee Plan that become payable by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Sellers obligations under this Section 6.11(d) shall be
deemed fully satisfied to the extent (i) all such liabilities to pay such
bonuses are accrued as Current Liabilities in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, and (ii) the Company has sufficient cash on hand at the
Closing Date to fully satisfy such liabilities.

(e) The Seller shall provide only the Affected Employees listed on Schedule
6.11(e) of the Disclosure Schedules with full vesting of any award or benefit
under any Seller Employee Plan where such vesting was otherwise conditioned
upon the future performance of services with the Seller, including under any
Seller Employee Plan that is intended to be tax-qualified under section
401(a) of the Code and under any related non-qualified plan and any Seller
Employee Plan that provides for stock-based compensation.

(f) The Seller shall retain, and the Buyer shall have no responsibility for,
any and all liabilities that have arisen or may arise with respect to any
Seller Employee Plan. Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, the Seller
shall assume and be responsible for (i) claims for workers compensation or for
the type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not
covered by ERISA) that are incurred on or prior to the Closing Date by any
employee or former employee of the Company (or their beneficiaries and
dependents) and arising under any Seller Employee Plan and (ii) claims
relating to "COBRA" coverage attributable to "qualifying events" occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date with respect to any employee or former employee
of the Company (or their beneficiaries and dependents). For purposes of the
foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when the
medical services are rendered or medical supplies are provided, and not when
the condition arose; provided that claims relating to a hospital confinement
that commences on or prior to the Closing Date but continues thereafter shall
be treated as incurred on or prior to the Closing Date. A disability or
workers compensation claim shall be considered incurred on or prior to the
Closing Date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall advise the Buyer and
the Acquisition Sub of any and all Contracts of the Company that would
reasonably be expected to trigger the payment of any "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.



 

42 Section 6.12 _Non-Competition_.

(a) During the period commencing immediately after the Closing and ending on
the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Noncompetition Period_ ")
(unless only a shorter maximum period is permitted by applicable Law, in which
case, during such shorter period), the Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (the Seller together with its Affiliates, the " _Restricted
Entities_ ") not to, engage, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, have any
direct or indirect ownership interest in, manage, operate, finance or control
any business anywhere in the United States which is engaged, either directly
or indirectly, in the Restricted Business.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 6.12, any
Restricted Entity may:

(i) purchase or otherwise acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock or
controlling interest or otherwise, or engage in any similar merger and
acquisition activity with, any Person or business that engages in the
Restricted Business and thereafter continue such Persons business, so long as
at the time of such acquisition, the revenues derived from that portion of
the acquired Person that engages in the Restricted Business constitute less
than 15% of the annual gross revenues of the acquired Person;

(ii) acquire, own or manage for the account of third parties through a mutual
fund, employee benefit plan, trust account or similar investment pool or
vehicle, any class of security of any Person regardless of whether such Person
engages in the Restricted Business (so long as such investment is solely
passive in nature and made only for investment purposes);

(iii) hold or make any equity investment in any Person in which (x) no
Restricted Entity has a right to designate a majority, or such higher amount
constituting a controlling number, of the members of the board of directors
(or similar governing body) of such Person, and (y) such Restricted Entity
holds not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities or similar
equity interest in such Person; _provided_ , that no Restricted Entity
controls the management of such Person; or

(iv) for the avoidance of doubt, engage in manufacturing of any kind and any
selling, marketing, distributing, supplying, renting, third party billing or
any other business activity in the fields of pain management, wound site
management or post-operative surgical treatments.

(c) In the event any Affiliate of the Seller ceases to be an Affiliate of the
Seller (or any of its successors and assigns), the provisions of this Section
6.12 shall no longer apply to such Person.

(d) If the Seller is purchased or otherwise acquired by merger, purchase of
assets, stock or controlling interest or otherwise, by any Person that is not
an Affiliate of the Seller immediately prior to the execution of the
definitive agreement relating to such purchase or other acquisition, then (i)
such Person and its Affiliates shall not be deemed Restricted Entities for the
purposes of this Section 6.12 and (ii) the restrictions set forth in Section
6.12(e) and (f) shall not apply to such Person and its Affiliates.



 

43 (e) The Seller covenants that, during the Noncompetition Period, the Seller
shall not, and it shall cause its current Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or entice any clients or customers of the Company to
engage in any business relationship which could reasonably be expected to
materially harm the Restricted Business. 

(f) The Seller covenants that, during the period commencing from the Closing
Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Seller shall not, and it shall cause
its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly solicit (other than
a solicitation by general advertisement) the employment or engagement of
services of, any person who is or was employed as an employee, contractor or
consultant by the Company during such period on a full- or part-time basis.

(g) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 6.12 is
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that such
court shall be empowered to reform such provisions, in such jurisdiction to
the extent that comes closest to the intentions of the parties with
respect to such unreasonable term or provision. The covenants contained in
this Section 6.12 are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

(h) The Seller acknowledges that the covenants of the Seller set forth in this
Section 6.12 are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach
by the Seller of any provision of this Section 6.12 will result in irreparable
injury to the Buyer. The Seller acknowledges that in the event of such a
breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, the Buyer shall
be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and an equitable
accounting of all earnings, profits or other benefits arising therefrom, as
well as such other damages as may be appropriate.

Section 6.13 _Intercompany Liabilities; Release of Encumbrances_. Immediately
prior to the Closing, all liabilities owed by or to the Company to or from
the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be canceled without payment, in full
and complete satisfaction of such liabilities. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall have caused to be released all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) in and upon any of the properties and assets of the
Company or the Shares.

Section 6.14 _Insurance_.

(a) To the extent that the Seller shall be entitled under the terms and
conditions of "occurrence" based policies in effect on or prior to the
Closing Date to coverage for losses suffered by the Company after the Closing
arising out of any occurrences covered by such policies occurring prior to the
Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
such efforts and take such actions to recover such losses on behalf of the
Company pursuant to such policies as it would use or take in conducting its
own business in the ordinary course if such losses were suffered by the Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall deliver the proceeds  



 

44  thereby recovered to the Company. In the event of any dispute regarding the
date of any loss or occurrence, the terms of the applicable policy shall
govern. 

(b) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall provide, and shall cause the
Company to provide, the Seller with all records and other information
necessary for the reporting, investigation, negotiation and, if applicable,
prosecution of any claim made by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.14.

Section 6.15 _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller agrees that it will not, and it
will cause the Company and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and other agents and Representatives (including any investment
banking, legal or accounting firm retained by it or any of them and any
individual member or employee of the foregoing) (each, an " _Agent_ ") not
to: (a) initiate, solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or
the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal
or offer to its stockholders or any of them) with respect to a merger,
acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity
investment or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any
substantial portion of the assets or any equity securities of, the Company
(any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as a " _Proposal_
"); (b) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any substantive discussions with, any person
relating to a Proposal; (c) otherwise cooperate in any effort or attempt to
make, implement or accept a Proposal; or (d) enter into Contract with any
Person relating to a Proposal. The Seller shall notify the Buyer or the
Acquisition Sub immediately if any inquiries, proposals or offers related to a

48 Section 7.4 _Procedures_.

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement as a result of a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if
known) and copies of any relevant documentation evidencing such claim. The
failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VII except
and solely to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice from
the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party.
Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, each party shall cooperate with the other party in such defense
and make available all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in its possession or under the its control relating thereto as is reasonably
required or requested by the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to relinquish control of such defense
to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may subsequently reassert
control over such defense in the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
reasonably conduct the defense of the action, suit, proceeding or claim in
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. The party controlling
such defense shall keep the other party hereto advised of the status of such
Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations
made by the other party hereto with respect thereto. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
Third Party Claim that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified
Party or that does not include a full, complete and unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the
Indemnifying Party upon becoming aware of such claim, describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount  



 

49  or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and copies
of any relevant documentation evidencing such claim. The failure to provide
such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article VII except to the extent and solely that
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party
will have thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of such notice to dispute
the claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified
Party that it disputes such claim within thirty (30) calendar days after its
receipt of such notice, the claim specified in the notice will be
conclusively deemed a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party
in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified
Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation
shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information,
records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist
in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing
legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.

Section 7.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) No claim may be asserted against either party for breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written notice
of such claim is received by such party pursuant to the terms hereof on or
prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant upon which
such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 7.1, in which
case such representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim
until such claim has been finally resolved.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from the Seller by Buyer Indemnified Parties, or from the Buyer by Seller
Indemnified Parties, pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, respectively,
shall be in each case an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase
Price, _provided_ , that the provisions of this Section 7.5(b)(i) shall not
limit the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses recoverable with
respect to any breach of or failure to perform, carry out, satisfy or
discharge any covenant or agreement by the Seller, the Company and/or the
Buyer, as applicable, contained in Sections 6.1, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11,
6.12, 6.13, 6.15, 6.17, 6.19, 6.20 and 6.22;

(ii) the Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party, and the
Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party, for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, respectively,
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be
recovered from the Seller or the Buyer, respectively, in each case equals or
exceeds $1,500,000, and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of such amount,
_provided_ , that the provisions of this Section 7.5(b)(ii) shall not limit
the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses recoverable with respect
to any breach of or failure to perform, carry out, satisfy or discharge any
covenant or agreement by the Seller, the Company and/or the Buyer, as
applicable, contained in Sections 6.1, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13,
6.15, 6.17, 6.19, 6.20 and 6.22;



 

50 (iii) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss pursuant to Section 7.2 to the extent that a
specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss was reflected as a
Current Liability on the Closing Statement;

(iv) the right to indemnification or any other remedy in favor of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties based on representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; and

(v) except with respect to Third Party Claims, no party hereto shall have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect damages, including business interruption,
loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

(c) For all purposes of this Article VII, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any
insurance or other recoveries actually paid to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification and (ii) any Tax benefit arising in connection with the
accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses, but only to the extent
such Tax benefit is actually realized by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in the taxable period of such accrual, incurrence or payment of
such Loss, as applicable, determined by assuming that such Tax benefit is
usable in such period only on a last-used basis, considering all other
available Tax benefits.

(d) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery
under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as it or
they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. If
requested by the Seller, the Buyer shall assign, or cause to be assigned, to
the Seller all of the Buyers or its Affiliates rights to and interest in
such insurance policies and all potential proceeds therefrom, and the Seller
shall have the right to take any action to seek full recovery thereunder to
the extent such recovery efforts do not cause a material adverse effect on the
Companys ability to obtain additional or other insurance coverage.

(e) The limitations contained in Sections 7.5(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall not
apply to indemnifiable Losses in respect of to breaches of any Fundamental
Representation, fraud or intentional misrepresentations of fact.

Section 7.6 _Tax Matters_. Anything in this Article VII to the contrary
notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by Article VIII.

Section 7.7 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives or
is entitled to receive any payment from the Seller in respect of any Losses
pursuant to Section 7.2 and the Buyer Indemnified Party could, actually or
potentially, have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a
" _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted 



 

51  against the Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall assign, on a non-
recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights
to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary or appropriate
to permit the Seller to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment. If any such assignment would afford the Potential Contributor
any defense to the payment of the same, such assignment shall not take place
and the Buyer Indemnified Party will, at the Sellers direction and expense,
take all reasonable actions to seek to recover such claim from such Potential
Contributor. Any payment received in respect of such claim against the
Potential Contributor (whether by the Seller or the relevant Buyer Indemnified
Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be distributed,
(i) first, to the Buyer Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or
similar amount required to be paid by the Buyer Indemnified Party prior to the
Seller being required to make any payment to the Buyer Indemnified Party plus,
in the case of any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise
addressing such claim, (ii) second, to the Seller in an amount equal to the
aggregate payments made by the Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim, plus any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such
claim and (iii) the balance, if any, to the Buyer Indemnified Party.

Section 7.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in this Agreement,
effective as of the Closing, in the absence of fraud and intentional
misrepresentation of fact by the Seller in this Agreement (to the extent
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, waives
any rights and claims any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against the Seller,
whether in law or equity, relating to the Company and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by the Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, include, without limitation,
claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating
to any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty, except as specifically contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement. The Seller shall not have any right of contribution against
the Company with respect to any breach by the Seller or the Company of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.
Except as set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in the
absence of fraud and intentional misrepresentation of fact by the Buyer in
this Agreement (to the extent determined by a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, waives any rights and claims any Seller Indemnified
Party may have against the Company or the Buyer, whether in law or equity,
relating to the Buyer and/or the transactions contemplated hereby. Except for
claims for equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive
relief, made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement, including Section 6.12, after the Closing, subject to the
foregoing, this Article VII and Article VIII will provide the exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

52 ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1 _Indemnification Obligations With Respect to Taxes_.

(a) The Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer, the Company and their Affiliates from and against:

(i) all Taxes imposed on or relating to the Company due with respect to
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including all Taxes of the
Company that are due with respect to periods (the " _Straddle Periods_ ") that
include but do not end on the Closing Date to the extent attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;

(ii) all Losses resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of the
representations and warranties with respect to Taxes that are contained in
Article IV or in this Article VIII and any covenants contained in this
Agreement with respect to Taxes;

(iii) all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 by reason of any affiliation existing on or before the Closing Date;

(iv) all Taxes, except for the Taxes described in Sections 8.3(a)(i) and (ii),
resulting from an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state, local or foreign tax law) with respect to
the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder, and

(v) all losses imposed on or sustained by the Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company after the Closing Date), directly or indirectly, by
reason of or in connection with the foregoing amounts.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall only be liable for losses
resulting from Michigan Use Taxes (and any penalties, interest or additions
to tax) resulting from the purchase by the Company of infusion pumps from and
after February 1, 1998, through the Closing Date to the extent such losses are
in excess of the amounts, if any, reserved for such amounts (excluding any
reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) on the Balance Sheet as such reserve is adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and
practice of the Company (the " _Michigan Use Tax Reserve_ "). The Buyer
hereby acknowledges that the Seller shall be entitled to offset and credit
against any liability for indemnification the Seller may have to the Buyer,
the Company, and/or their Affiliates pursuant to this Section 8.1 an amount
equal to the difference (to the extent such difference is a number greater
than zero) between (i) the amount of the Michigan Use Tax Reserve in excess of
the amount of actual losses resulting from Michigan Use Taxes (and any
penalties, interest or additions to tax), as finally adjudicated by the
relevant Governmental Authority _minus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of all
reasonable and documented costs, fees and expenses actually incurred by the
Buyer and the Company after the Closing Date in connection with the
prosecution of the Companys claims relating to Michigan Use Taxes.



 

53 (b) The Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller from and against:

(i) all Taxes of the Company that are due with respect to periods commencing
after the Closing Date;

(ii) all Taxes of the Company that are due with respect to Straddle Periods to
the extent attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period commencing on
the day following the Closing Date;

(iii) all losses resulting from any breach of any covenants of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement or contained in any certificate delivered by the
Buyer pursuant hereto, in each case, with respect to Taxes; and

(iv) all losses imposed on or sustained by the Seller or its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, by reason or in connection with the foregoing
amounts.

(c) For purposes of this Article VIII, whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one of which ended at the close of
the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Company for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company
were closed at the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
however, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes,
such as real and personal property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably
between such periods on a daily basis; _provided_ _further_ however, that any
such taxes attributable to any property that was owned by the Company at some
point in the Pre-Closing Period, but is not owned as of the Closing date
shall be allocated entirely to the period ending at the close of the Closing
Date. If the Company is permitted but not required under applicable state,
local, or foreign income tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of a taxable period, then the parties shall treat that day as the last day of
a taxable period. Where the Closing Date is treated as the last day of a
taxable period for purposes of federal, state, local or foreign income tax
Laws, the income of the Company shall be apportioned to the period up to and
including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing date by closing
the books of the Company as of the end of the Closing Date, _provided_
_further_ , however, the Buyer and the Seller agree to report all
transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing
Date after the Buyers purchase of the Shares on the Buyers Federal income
tax return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of the Seller and the Buyer under this Article VIII shall survive
the Closing indefinitely, shall be unconditional and absolute, and shall not
be subject to a deductible, threshold, or similar concept,  



 

54  except that the Sellers representations set forth in Section 4.15 shall
remain in effect until sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, as extended.

Section 8.2 _Tax Returns_.

(a) The Seller will include or have included in the consolidated federal
income tax Return of the affiliated group of corporations, within the meaning
of Section 1504(a) of the Code, of which the Seller is the common parent
corporation, for all periods or portions thereof through the Closing Date, the
income of the Company (including any deferred income from
intercompany transactions triggered into income by Section 1.1502-13 of the
Treasury regulations and any excess loss accounts taken into income under
Section 1.1502-19 of the Treasury regulations) for all such periods and will
pay or cause to be paid any federal income Taxes attributable to such income.
The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Returns for the Company that are filed after the Closing Date, other than
income tax Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary
or combined income tax Return of Seller will include the operations of the
Company.

(b) All Returns that are to be prepared and filed by the Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) above and that relate to Taxes for which the Seller is liable
under this Article VIII (including Straddle Period Returns) shall be
prepared by the Buyer in a manner consistent with reasonable past customs and
procedures of the Company and shall be submitted to the Seller not later than
fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the due date for filing of such Returns,
taking into account applicable extensions (or if such due date is within
forty-five (45) calendar days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date). The Seller shall have the right to
review such Returns and to review all work papers and procedures used to
prepare any such Return. If the Seller, within ten (10) calendar days after
delivery of any such Return, notifies the Buyer in writing that it objects to
any of the items in such Return, the parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the dispute and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall
be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such Return) by an internationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen by both the Buyer and the Seller (or, if the Buyer and
the Seller cannot agree on such an accounting firm, then each shall select an
independent accounting firm and such accounting firms shall select a third
independent accounting firm). Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant
Return shall be filed on that basis, _provided_ that the Buyer shall have the
right to file the relevant Return prior to resolution of such items if the
Buyer reasonably determines that such filing is necessary to avoid applicable
penalties and interest. The costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller. The Seller shall to the
Buyer the amount of the Taxes with respect to such Returns within five days
following any demand by the Buyer for such payment.

(c) The Buyer shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Company to) amend,
refile or otherwise modify any Return relating in whole or in part to the
Company with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of the Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Seller shall not amend, refile, or otherwise
modify any such Return if such action could have an adverse affect on the
liability of the Company, without  



 

55  the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) All sales, use, transfer and other similar Taxes, including any stock
transfer stamp Taxes resulting from the sale of the Shares, shall be borne by
the Seller, except to the extent set forth in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.3(a)(i).

Section 8.3 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. (a) At the Buyers option, the
Seller and the Buyer shall join in making an election under Code Section
338(h)(10) (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign tax
law) (collectively a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Shares. The Seller shall be liable for and pay any
Tax attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and will
indemnify the Buyer and the Company against any adverse consequences arising
out of any failure to pay such Tax. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
(i) the Buyer shall be liable for and pay any state or local transfer, sales
and use, notarial or similar fees or Taxes arising as a result of the sale of
the Shares and a Section 338(h)(10) Election and the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Buyer shall be liable for and pay any income,
franchise or similar Taxes imposed by any state or local taxing authority as
a result of any Code Section 338(g) election (or any comparable election under
state law) if such state or local taxing authority does not allow or respect a
Section 338(h)(10) Election (or any comparable or resulting election under
state law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares, and (iii) the
Buyer and the Company shall indemnify the Seller against any adverse
consequences arising out of any failure to pay the Taxes described in (i)
and (ii).

(b) The parties agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the
Company (plus other relevant items) shall be allocated to the assets of the
Company for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) as
shown on the allocation schedule attached hereto as Schedule 8.3. The Buyer,
the Company and the Seller shall file all Returns (including amended Returns
and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with
such allocation.

(c) At the Closing, if requested by the Buyer, the Seller will deliver to the
Buyer a fully executed IRS Form 8023 reflecting the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, and any similar form provided for under state, local or foreign Law.
As requested from time to time by the Buyer (whether before, at or after the
Closing), the Seller shall assist the Buyer in, and shall provide the
necessary information to the Buyer, in connection with the preparation of any
form or document required to effect a valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including IRS Form 8883 (Asset Allocation Statement Under Section
338), and any similar form under state, local or other Law and any schedules
or attachments thereto, each prepared consistently with Schedule 8.3 hereto
(collectively, " _Section 338 Forms_"). Upon delivery of any Section 338 Form
by the Buyer to the Seller, the Seller shall cause such Section 338 Form to be
duly and promptly executed and shall deliver such executed Section 338 Form
to the Buyer. If the Buyer determines that any change is to be made in a
Section 338 Form previously executed and delivered to the Buyer, then the
Buyer may prepare a new Section 338 Form and deliver such new Section 338
Form to the Seller and the Seller shall cause such Section 338 Form to be
fully and promptly executed and shall deliver such executed Section 338 Form
to the Buyer.



 

56 Section 8.4 _Contest Provisions_.

(a) In the event (i) the Seller or its Affiliates or (ii) the Buyer or its
Affiliates receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments or other disputes concerning Taxes with respect to which the other
party may incur liability under this Article VIII, the party in receipt of
such notice shall promptly notify the other parties of such matter in
writing, provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect
a partys right to indemnification hereunder unless and to the extent such
failure materially adversely affects the partys ability to challenge
such Tax audits or assessments.

(b) The Seller shall represent the interests of the Company in any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding to the extent such audit or proceeding
relates to any Tax for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date, and to employ counsel of the Sellers choice at the Sellers expense, if
the Seller notifies the Buyer of its decision to take such actions within
thirty (30) calendar days of the date on which the Seller receives notice of
any such audit or proceeding from the Buyer (with respect to audits or
proceedings as to which the Buyer first received notice from a Governmental
Authority or other Person) or the date on which the Seller delivered to the
Buyer notice of any such audit or proceeding (with respect to audits or
proceedings as to which the Seller first received notice from a Governmental
Authority or other Person), _provided_ _however_ , that the Buyer may, at its
own expense, attend, but not participate in or control, all conferences,
meetings and proceedings relating to such audits or proceedings. The
Seller shall inform the Buyer of all developments and events relating to such
audits or proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Seller elects to
so represent the interests of the Company, the Seller shall not be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
claim for Taxes with respect to any Return of the Company which would
adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Buyer or the Company for any
period after the Closing Date to any extent (including, but not limited to,
the imposition of income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or
cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods,
the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of
the loss or credit carry forwards) without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c) The Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the
Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Taxes with respect to taxable periods including (but not ending on) or
beginning after the Closing Date and to employ counsel of the Buyers choice
at the Buyers expense, provided that the Buyer shall not be entitled
to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any claim regarding Taxes that would adversely affect the liability of the
Seller for any Taxes for any period ending on or before the Closing Date or
for any Straddle Period, without the prior consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall
not be required to the extent that the Buyer has fully indemnified the Seller
against the effects of such settlement. Where consent to a settlement is
withheld by the Seller pursuant to this section, the Seller may continue or
initiate any further proceedings at its own expense, the Buyer shall not be
obligated to incur any further expenses in such matter and the liability of
the Buyer, after giving effect to this Agreement, shall not exceed the
liability that would have resulted from the settlement or amended return.



 

57 Section 8.5 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Seller
and the Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to): (a)
assist the other party in preparing and filing any Returns or reports which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
this Article VIII; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Returns of the Company; (c)
make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company; (d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Company for taxable periods for
which the other may have a liability under this Article VIII; and (e) furnish
the other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority
in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any
such taxable period.

Section 8.6 _Retention of Records_. After the Closing Date, the Seller, the
Buyer and the Company will preserve all information, records or documents
relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Company until ninety (90) calendar
days after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions thereof) with respect to the assessment of such Taxes, provided
that neither party shall dispose of any of the foregoing items without first
offering such items to the other party.

Section 8.7 _Refunds and Tax Benefit_. Any Tax refunds that are received by
the Buyer or the Company, or that do not result in a cash payment but instead
are credited against Tax to which the Buyer or the Company becomes entitled,
that relate to the Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date (including, without limitation, the pre-Closing Straddle Period)
shall be for the account of the Seller, and the Buyer shall pay to the Seller
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) calendar
days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

Section 8.8 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax
allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements binding
the Company shall be terminated with respect to the Company as of the day
before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be obligated to make any payment to any Affiliate, Governmental
Authority or other Person pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement for
any past or future period.

Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

(b) (i) by the Seller, if the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub breaches or fails

by April 30, 2007 (as such date may be extended by Section 6.3, the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.1(d) shall not be available if the failure of the party
(in the case of the Seller, including for this purpose the Company) so
requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date; or

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer in the event that any Governmental

conditions precedent set forth in Section 9.1 and 9.3 shall have been

million dollars (US $3,000,000.00) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event the Seller elects to terminate this Agreement

acknowledges that in the event that this Agreement is terminated under any of
the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (ii) of this Section

regulations, and with the rules and policies of all applicable third-party

8\. TERM AND TERMINATION.

A. TERM. The initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) years,
commencing on the Effective Date; provided that this Agreement shall be
automatically renewed for succeeding terms of one (1) year each unless, at
least one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the expiration of the
then-current term, either party gives to the other party written notice of its
intent to not renew the Agreement. During any and all renewal terms of this
Agreement, all of the terms and provisions hereof will remain in full force
and effect, save and except only as modified or amended in the manner
specified in this Agreement.

B. TERMINATION. This Agreement, during both the original term and any renewal
terms hereof, cannot be terminated prior to the expiration of the then-
current term except as follows:

(1.) Termination by I-Flow. I-Flow shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement at any time in its discretion upon at least one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days prior written notice to InfuSystem.

(2.) Termination by InfuSystem. InfuSystem shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement by providing in its discretion a notice at any time after the
first anniversary of the Effective Date, which notice shall designate a
termination date no earlier than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after
the date of such notice. (3.) After Notice and Opportunity to Cure. Either party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches this
Agreement or materially defaults in the performance of a provision of this
Agreement and such material breach or default is not cured within sixty (60)
calendar days after the defaulting party receives written notice of such
breach or default from the other party.

(4.) Immediately. Either party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement immediately upon delivery of written notice of termination to the
other party if such other party:

(a.) is in material breach or default under this Agreement and has failed to
cure such breach or default within the time specified for curing a material
breach or default;

(b.) applies for or consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee or
liquidator of all or substantially all of its assets, or files a petition or

insolvency law;

(c.) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, admits in writing its
inability to pay its debts as they become due, or makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors;

(d.) is adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction
or is the subject of such a courts order, judgment or decree approving a
petition seeking its reorganization; or

(e.) has a receiver or trustee appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction
to manage its assets, and such receiver or trustee has not been discharged
within forty-five (45) calendar days after appointment.

The effective date of any termination under this subsection (4.) shall be the
date upon which the defaulting party receives the written notice required by
this subsection.

(5.) Upon Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated upon the mutual
written consent of the parties.

(6.) Upon Breach of Privacy Provisions. Upon I-Flows knowledge of a material
breach by InfuSystem of Section 23 of this Agreement, I-Flow may:

(a.) Provide an opportunity for InfuSystem to cure the breach or end the
violation, which cure period may be less than sixty (60) calendar days.
Should I-Flow provide InfuSystem an opportunity to cure the breach or end the
violation of Section 23 and InfuSystem does not cure the    breach or end the violation within time specified by I-Flow, I-Flow shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately;

(b.) Immediately terminate this Agreement if InfuSystem has breached a
material term of Section 23 of this Agreement and cure is not possible; or

(c.) If neither termination nor cure is feasible, I-Flow shall report the
violation to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

C. RETURN OF RECORDS. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all
information and records owned or provided by I-Flow to InfuSystem, or created
or received by InfuSystem on behalf of I-Flow, including, without limitation,
any managed care contracts and any "Protected Healthcare Information," as
that term is defined by the Federal Privacy Rule (hereafter "PHI" and,
collectively with all such information and records, the "Information"), must
be, at I-Flows expense, returned to I-Flow or destroyed within thirty (30)
calendar days of termination (or, if shorter in duration, within the period of
time provided by applicable law, rules or regulations). This provision shall
apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of
InfuSystem. InfuSystem shall retain no copies of the PHI.

In the event that InfuSystem determines that returning or destroying the
Information is infeasible, InfuSystem shall provide to I-Flow notification of
the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual
agreement of the parties, InfuSystem shall extend the protections of this
Agreement to such Information and limit further uses and disclosures of such
Information to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible,
for so long as InfuSystem maintains such Information.

D. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR NON-RENEWAL. In the event I-Flow (i) elects not to
renew this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(A), or (ii) terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8(B)(1), I-Flow shall be responsible for an
amount equal to the lower of (a) the aggregate amount of the rent payable by
InfuSystem under the real property lease for the space occupied by the
InfuSystem Personnel (including any termination penalties or rental charges
incurred following such termination or non-renewal), determined reasonably and
consistent with past practice, for the remainder of the then current lease
term as of the date of such notice of non-renewal or termination, as
applicable (the "Current Lease Term"), less all amounts actually received by
InfuSystem in connection with any sublease or assignment of the real
property lease for such space, or (b) $50,000 (the lower of such two amounts,
the "Rent Payable"). I-Flow shall pay the Rent Payable, if any, to InfuSystem
on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the end of the
Current Lease Term. 9\. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION; RELEASE.

A. This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Agreement in its entirety
and supersedes the Existing Agreement in all respects. This Agreement
contains the entire agreement by and between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior
understandings, agreements and representations, both oral and written,
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.

B. Any modification or amendment of or to this Agreement must be in writing
and executed by I-Flow and by InfuSystem. The parties agree to take such
action as is necessary to amend this Agreement from time to time as necessary
for I-Flow or InfuSystem to comply with the requirements of the Federal
Privacy Rule in the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health
Information at 45 CFR 164.501 (the "Federal Privacy Rule") and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Public Law 104-191.

C. Each of I-Flow, on the one hand, and InfuSystem, on the other hand, on
behalf of itself and each of its respective affiliates, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a "Releasing Party"), hereby fully releases and
discharges the other and each of its respective affiliates, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a "Released Party"), from, and to the extent
applicable, relinquishes, all rights, obligations, liabilities, claims and
actions, whether known or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising, at law
or in equity or otherwise, that each such Releasing Party now has or may have
against any Released Party, arising out of or in connection with the Existing
Agreement or the providing of comparable services prior to the date hereof.

10\. EFFECT OF INVALIDITY OR UNENFORCEABILITY. In the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any section, paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase, word or numeral or the application thereof in any circumstance shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,
such invalidity or unenforceability shall be severable and severed from and
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provisions, section,
paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, word or numeral in any other circumstance
and/or the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement,
unless such severance would materially destroy the intent of the parties in
entering into this Agreement, in which case the parties shall immediately
commence negotiations in good faith to achieve a revised, fully valid and
enforceable Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such a revised, fully
valid and enforceable Agreement is not executed by both parties within thirty
(30) calendar days after the event triggering severance, then either party may
immediately terminate this Agreement.

11\. AGREEMENT NOT RESTRICTIVE. Except as otherwise expressly specified
herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent either party
from otherwise conducting business, or entering into any contractual
relationship with any third party. 12\. NOTICES. All notices required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement shall be made in writing and shall be sufficiently given only if
personally delivered or mailed by overnight courier or certified or registered

extent that the relief sought is within the jurisdiction of an arbitrator in a
statutory arbitration to award, be settled exclusively by arbitration
in Michigan, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures then in effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may, by
mutual agreement, modify such rules of JAMS then in effect to provide for
the parties exercise of whatever discovery mechanisms, prior to the
arbitration hearing, they may mutually agree upon; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the arbitrator shall be chosen mutually by the parties and shall not have
jurisdiction or authority to change, add to, or subtract from any of the

findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrators decision shall be
final and binding and judgment may be entered on the arbitrators award in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

If any party to this Agreement shall bring any action, suit, arbitration,
mediation, counterclaim or appeal for any relief against any other party,
declaratory or otherwise, to enforce the terms hereof or to declare rights
hereunder, the Prevailing Party in such action shall be entitled to recover
as recoverable costs in any such action its actual attorneys fees and costs,
all expert fees and costs, all court and arbitration expenses, and any other
costs reasonably and properly incurred, including any fees and costs incurred
in bringing and prosecuting such action and enforcing any order, judgment,
ruling, or award granted as part of such action. As used in this Section,
"Prevailing Party" shall include, without limitation, a party which obtains

any action brought by any party hereto against the other arising out of or in
any way related to any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or to the
performance or breach thereof, whether such action is at law or in equity, is
beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator in a statutory arbitration to award,
the parties agree that the sole forum for any such action shall be a court of
competent jurisdiction in Michigan.

21\. CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Each party to this Agreement represents and warrants
to the other that it has the right, power, legal capacity and authority to
enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and that all
necessary approvals and consents have been obtained in connection with the
execution and performance of this Agreement. Each party further represents and
warrants that its execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly
authorized by its respective governing body.

22\. CONFIDENTIALITY. The parties recognize that in connection with
the performance of this Agreement, the parties may furnish and disclose to
each other confidential and proprietary information including, without
limitation, information relating to the parties respective organization,
personnel, business activities, policies, finances, costs, marketing plans,
projected revenues, technology, rights, obligations, liabilities, strategies
and customer lists (collectively, "Confidential Information"). Each party, to
the extent it comes into possession of Confidential Information of the other
party, agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, it
shall not directly or indirectly use such Confidential Information for its own
benefit or in connection with its business relationships with
patients/customers/clients of the owner of the Confidential Information, and
shall take all reasonable care to ensure that such Confidential Information
shall not be disclosed to any third party, including imposing
reasonable confidentiality requirements with respect to such Confidential
Information on its employees, agents, counsel, accountants and other
representatives, except insofar as: (i) disclosure may be specifically
authorized in writing from time to time by the owner of the Confidential
Information; (ii) such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed in
connection with performance of this Agreement, or pursuant to any right or
license granted by the owner of the Confidential Information; (iii) the
recipient of the Confidential Information can demonstrate, by independent
documentation, that such Confidential Information was previously made public
by the Confidential Informations owner; (iv) the recipient of the
Confidential Information can demonstrate, by independent documentation, that
such Confidential Information was in the public domain, prior to its
disclosure hereunder and otherwise than as a consequence of a breach of its
obligations hereunder; (v) the recipient of the Confidential Information can
demonstrate, by independent documentation, that such Confidential Information
was known by the recipient prior to its disclosure hereunder or was
independently developed by the recipient without the aid or use of any
information disclosed hereunder; or (vi) such disclosure is required under
compulsion of law, including subpoena, civil investigative demand, oral
questions or interrogatories, or other compulsory process; provided that, the
Confidential Informations owner shall be given notice of service of such
demand or process and a reasonable opportunity to defend against such demand
or process, and the party against whom such demand or process is asserted
provides all reasonable cooperation in opposing the same to the fullest extent
permitted by law. Each of the parties, for itself and its successors and
assigns, acknowledges that any violation of this    Section 22 would seriously and irreparably injure the owner of the
Confidential Information. In addition to all other remedies permitted by law
or in equity and without limiting any action at law or in equity to which
such owner may be entitled, the owner of any Confidential Information shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief, without bond, to enforce the terms and
conditions stated herein. 

23\. PRIVACY. In the course of providing services pursuant to this Agreement,
InfuSystem may receive or create PHI on behalf of I-Flow. As a result,
InfuSystem may be deemed a "Business Associate" of I-Flow, as that term is
defined at 45 CFR 160.103, and must utilize appropriate safeguards to prevent
the use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this Agreement.

A. To this end, InfuSystem agrees as follows:

(1.) InfuSystem agrees not to use or further disclose PHI other than as
permitted or required by this Agreement or as required by law. 

(2.) InfuSystem agrees to use appropriate safeguards to prevent use or
disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this Agreement. InfuSystem
agrees to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards that
reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of electronic PHI that it creates, receives, maintains
or transmits on behalf of I-Flow.

(3.) InfuSystem agrees to mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful
effect that is known to InfuSystem of a use or disclosure of PHI by
InfuSystem in violation of the requirements of this Agreement.

(4.) InfuSystem agrees to report to I-Flow any use or disclosure of PHI not
provided for by this Agreement of which InfuSystem becomes aware. InfuSystem
agrees to report to I-Flow any security incident, as that term is defined at
45 CFR 164.304, of which it becomes aware.

(5.) InfuSystem agrees to ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor, to
whom it provides PHI received from or created by InfuSystem on behalf of
I-Flow agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply through this
Agreement to InfuSystem with respect to such information. InfuSystem agrees to
ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor, to whom it provides
electronic PHI agrees to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to
protect it.

(6.) InfuSystem agrees to provide access, at the request of I-Flow, and in the
time and manner designated by I-Flow, to PHI in a "Designated Record Set" as
that term is defined at 45 CFR 164.501, to I-Flow or, as directed by I-Flow,
to an "Individual" as that term is defined at 45 CFR 160.103 (and shall
include a person who qualifies as a personal representative in accordance with
45 CFR 164.502(g)) in order to meet the requirements under 45 CFR 164.524
which govern an Individuals right to access to his or her own PHI. (7.) InfuSystem agrees to make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record
Set that I-Flow directs or agrees to pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526 at the
request of I-Flow or an Individual, and in the time and manner designated by
I-Flow.

(8.) InfuSystem agrees to make internal practices, books, and records,
including policies and procedures and PHI, relating to the use and disclosure
of PHI received from, or created or received by InfuSystem on behalf of
I-Flow available to I-Flow or to the Secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services (hereafter referred to as the "Secretary"), in a time and
manner designated by I-Flow or the Secretary, for purposes of the
Secretary determining I-Flows compliance with the Federal Privacy Rule.

(9.) InfuSystem agrees to document such disclosures of PHI and information
related to such disclosures as would be required for I-Flow to respond to a
request by an Individual for an accounting of disclosures of PHI in accordance
with 45 CFR 164.528.

(10.) InfuSystem agrees to provide to I-Flow or an Individual, in time and
manner designated by I-Flow, information collected in accordance with this
Agreement, to permit I-Flow to respond to a request by an Individual for an
accounting of disclosures of PHI in accordance with 45 CFR 164.528.

B. Pursuant to the Federal Privacy Rule, I-Flow shall inform InfuSystem of
privacy practices and restrictions as follows: 

(1.) I-Flow shall provide InfuSystem with the notice of privacy practices that
I-Flow produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520, as well as any changes to
such notice.

(2). I-Flow shall provide InfuSystem with any changes in, or revocation of,
permission by Individual to use or disclose PHI, to the extent such changes
affect InfuSystems permitted or required uses and disclosures.

(3.) I-Flow shall notify InfuSystem of any restriction to the use or
disclosure of PHI that I-Flow has agreed to in accordance with 45 CFR 164.522
to the extent such restriction may affect InfuSystems use or disclosure of
PHI.

C. _Permitted Uses and Disclosures._

(1.) Except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, InfuSystem may use or
disclose PHI to perform functions, activities, or services for, or on behalf
of, I-Flow as specified in this Agreement, provided such use or disclosure
would not violate the Federal Privacy Rule if done by I-Flow or the minimum
necessary policies and procedures of I-Flow. I-Flow shall not request
InfuSystem to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible
under the Federal Privacy    Rule if done by I-Flow or that would violate I-Flows minimum necessary
policies and procedures.

(2.) Except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, InfuSystem may use PHI for
the proper management and administration of InfuSystem or to carry out the
legal responsibilities of InfuSystem.

(3.) Except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, InfuSystem may disclose
PHI for the proper management and administration of InfuSystem, provided that
disclosures are "Required By Law" as that term is defined at 45 CFR 164.501,
or InfuSystem obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom
the information is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or
further disclosed only as Required By Law or for the purpose for which it was
disclosed to the person, and the person notifies InfuSystem of any instances
in which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been
breached.

(4.) Except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, InfuSystem may use PHI to
provide "Data Aggregation" services to I-Flow as permitted by 42 CFR
164.504(e)(2)(i)(B).

(5.) InfuSystem may use PHI to report violations of law to appropriate Federal
and State authorities, consistent with 42 CFR 164.502(j)(1).

24\. SURVIVAL. The respective rights and obligations of InfuSystem under
Sections 8(C), 9 through 17, 19 through 21, 23 and 24 of this Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. The obligations of each party
under this Section 22 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
expire upon the fifth (5th) anniversary of the effective date of such
termination.

25\. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

[The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank.] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, InfuSystem and I-Flow have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective duly authorized officers as of the Effective
Date specified on the first page of this Agreement.

incurred in bringing and prosecuting such action and enforcing any order,
judgment, ruling, or award granted as part of such action. As used in this
Section, "Prevailing Party" shall include, without limitation, a Party which
obtains substantially the relief sought by it.

7.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

7.6 Severability. Should any part or provision of this Agreement be rendered
or declared invalid by reason of any law or by decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction, the validity of any other term, clause, or provision shall not
be affected provided that such invalid or unenforceable provision is and can
be replaced with an enforceable clause which most closely achieves the result
intended by such invalid clause.

7.7 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and
shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

7.8 Drafting. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall not be construed
against either Party as the drafter.

conditions hereof.

agreements, between the Parties hereto in regard to the subject matter hereof
