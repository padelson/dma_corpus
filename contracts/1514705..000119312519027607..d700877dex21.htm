MERGER

 

 __SECTION 2.1 _Closing of the Merger_. __

 

(a) _Closing Date_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions (other than those conditions that are not legally permitted to be
waived) to closing set forth in _Article VI_ , the closing (the " _Closing_ ")
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.1_ shall
be held at the offices of Parents outside legal counsel at 30 Rockefeller
Plaza, New York, New York 10112 on the next Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are not legally
permitted to be waived) of all of the conditions set forth in  _Article VI_
(other than conditions that would normally be satisfied on the Closing Date,
but subject to satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are
not legally permitted to be waived) of those conditions) commencing at
9:00 a.m., local time, or such other place, date and time as may be mutually
agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. The " _Closing Date_ ," as
referred to herein, shall mean the date on which the Closing actually occurs.

 

(b) _Effective Time_. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, Parent and SXCP shall cause a certificate of merger
effecting the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, duly executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time
of such filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and date
as may be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger)
being the " _Effective Time_ "). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
SXCP, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and SXCP shall
continue as the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Entity_ ").

 



11

    

(c) _ Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities_. Subject in each case to
_Sections 2.1(e)_ and _2.1(f)_ , at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, SXCP, SXCP
General Partner, any Holder of SXCP Common Units, any Holder of Parent
Common Stock, or any other Person:

(i) _Merger Consideration_. Each of the SXCP Public Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive:



     | (x) |

1.40 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common
Stock (such conversion ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), and 

---|---|--- 



     | (y) |

a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (aa) |

the number of days beginning with the first day of the most recent full
calendar quarter with respect to which an SXCP unitholder distribution record
date has not occurred (or, if there is no such full calendar quarter, then
beginning with the first day of the partial calendar quarter in which the
Closing occurs), and ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing,
multiplied by 

---|---|--- 



     | (bb) |

the quotient of the Daily Distribution Rate divided by $10.91 

---|---|--- 
 

((x) and (y) collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) _Retirement of SXCP Public Units_. Each SXCP Public Unit, upon being
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder of such SXCP Public Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to be a
limited partner of SXCP or have any rights with respect to such SXCP Public
Units, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
distributions, dividends and Fractional Share Proceeds to which former
Holders of SXCP Public Units become entitled all in accordance with this
_Article II_ upon the Surrender of (A) a certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented SXCP Public Units (a " _SXCP Certificate_ ")
or (B) uncertificated SXCP Public Units represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry SXCP Common Units_ "), together with such properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

(iii) _Treatment of Parent-Owned Partnership Interests_. All (a) SXCP
General Partner Interest, (b) SXCP Incentive Distribution Rights, and (c) SXCP
Common Units that are not SXCP Public Units shall, in each case, remain
outstanding as partnership interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by
the Merger.

 



12

    

(iv) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The limited liability company interests in
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive an aggregate number of common
units of the Surviving Entity equal to the number of SXCP Public Units that
are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)(i)_. At the Effective Time, the books and records of SXCP
shall be revised to reflect the cancellation and retirement of all
SXCP Public Units and the conversion of the limited liability company
interest in Merger Sub into common units of the Surviving Entity, and the
existence of SXCP (as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without
dissolution.

 

(d) _Other Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall be conducted in
accordance with and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of limited partnership of SXCP shall continue as the certificate
of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the SXCP Partnership
Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of
limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance
with applicable Laws and the terms of the SXCP Partnership Agreement.

__(e) _ No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and (ii) each registered
Holder of SXCP Public Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all SXCP Public Units held by such Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 2.1(e)_, a cash
payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional shares representing such
Holders proportionate interest, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (the " _Share Proceeds_ ") in one or more transactions of a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, such number equal to the excess of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock reserved with the Exchange
Agent by Parent pursuant to  _Section 2.2(a)_ minus (ii) the aggregate
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that Holders of SXCP Public
Units are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ and _Section
2.1(c)(ii)_ (such excess, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be equal
to the aggregate number of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that the
registered Holders of SXCP Public Units converted pursuant to the Merger would
have otherwise been entitled to receive, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash Share Proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of SXCP Public
Units that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing price on the NYSE in the
manner provided in this _Section 2.1(e)_ and such sales shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the Share Proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the Holders of such SXCP Public Units, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such Share Proceeds in trust for the benefit of
the Holders of such SXCP Public Units (the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Fractional Share
Proceeds to which each Holder of such SXCP Public Units shall be entitled, if
any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate Share Proceeds comprising the
Fractional Share

 



13

    

 Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such Holder of such SXCP Public Units would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of such SXCP Public Units
would otherwise be entitled.

 

(f) _Certain Adjustments_. If between the Execution Date and the Effective
Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
number of outstanding SXCP Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities
(including any different class or series of securities) by reason of any
dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities,
equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other
similar transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or
agreed upon with a record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the
Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to
provide to SXCP, Merger Sub and SXCP Public Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and thereafter, all
references in this Agreement to the Merger Consideration, and any other
similarly dependent items shall be references to the Merger Consideration, and
any other similarly dependent items, as so adjusted; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section 2.1(f)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such dividend or distribution payable in equity
securities or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other
similar transaction, or the authorization, declaration or agreement to do
such transaction that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to be
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of SXCP Public Units_. __

 

 __(a) _ Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Prospectus/Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably
acceptable to SXCP to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ and any Fractional Share
Proceeds. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of SXCP
Public Units, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Fractional Share
Proceeds (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), (ii) reserve with the Exchange Agent the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_
and (ii) authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent any additional cash or other consideration as applicable in
excess of the Exchange Fund as and when necessary to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ and other
amounts required to be paid under this Agreement. Parent shall pay all costs
and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange
process. Any shares of Parent Common Stock, or fraction thereof, any remaining
Fractional Share Proceeds, any remaining amounts of the Exchange Fund and any
other remaining amount of funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
returned to Parent after the earlier to occur of (x) payment in full of all
amounts due to the Holders of SXCP Public Units and (y) twelve months after
the Closing Date, and any Holders of the SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP
Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any Fractional
Share Proceeds and any dividends or other distributions to which such Holders
may be entitled.

 



14

    

__(b) _ Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each Holder, as of the
Effective Time, of SXCP Public Units whose SXCP Public Units were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the SXCP
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the SXCP Certificates
(or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_) to
the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry SXCP Common Units, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which
shall be in such customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and
SXCP may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and instructions for
effecting the Surrender of such SXCP Certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_) or Book-Entry SXCP
Common Units in exchange for, as applicable, whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_
and/or _(d)_ and any Fractional Share Proceeds. Subject to  _Section
2.2(c)_, upon Surrender to the Exchange Agent of such SXCP Certificates (or
lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_) or Book-
Entry SXCP Common Units, together with such properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the Holder of an SXCP Certificate (or lost
certificate affidavit as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_) or Book-Entry
SXCP Common Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_,
(ii) the Fractional Share Proceeds, if any, payable in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable, and (iii) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ to which
such Holder is entitled. The instructions for effecting the Surrender of SXCP
Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder of
any SXCP Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen; it shall be a
condition to the right of such Holder to receive the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Proceeds, if any, and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ that the Exchange Agent shall
have received, along with the Letter of Transmittal, a duly executed lost
certificate affidavit, including an agreement to indemnify Parent, signed
exactly as the name or names of the registered Holder or Holders of SXCP
Public Units appeared on the books of SXCP immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with a customary bond and such other documents, in each case,
as Parent may reasonably require in connection therewith. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of SXCP or its
transfer agent of SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP Common Units (
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict the transfer of
any SXCP Partnership Interests other than the SXCP Public Units after the
Effective Time); and if such SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP Common Units
are presented to SXCP or its transfer agent for transfer, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the appropriate Merger Consideration, any
Fractional Share Proceeds and any dividends and distributions payable pursuant
to _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ as hereinabove provided. Until Surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each SXCP Certificate or Book-
Entry SXCP Common Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such Surrender the appropriate
Merger Consideration, together with any dividends and distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and/or _(d)_ , the

 



15

    

 appropriate Fractional Share Proceeds as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Fractional Share Proceeds
or any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_
and/or _(d)_.

(c) _Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged SXCP Public
Units_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Holder of any SXCP Certificate or Book-Entry SXCP Common
Units not Surrendered with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in respect thereof until the Surrender of such SXCP Certificate or
Book-Entry SXCP Common Units in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Subject
to the effect of applicable Laws, Parent shall pay, or cause the Exchange
Agent to pay, to the Holder of each SXCP Certificate or Book-Entry SXCP Common
Units, without interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of such SXCP Certificate
or Book-Entry SXCP Common Units, the amount of dividends or other
distributions previously paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to such SXCP Certificate or Book-Entry SXCP
Common Units that have a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the time of Surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends and distributions payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time and prior to such Surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
Surrender.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in SXCP Public Units_. All Merger
Consideration issued upon the Surrender of SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry
SXCP Common Units in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ (as well
as the Fractional Share Proceeds) shall be deemed to have been issued (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the SXCP Public Units
heretofore represented by such SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP Common
Units (including all rights to common units arrearages), subject, however, to
Parents obligation, with respect to SXCP Public Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared by SXCP on
such SXCP Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or
prior to the Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the Closing Date.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, SXCP, SXCP General Partner or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, other
distribution or Fractional Share Proceeds properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP Common Units shall not have
been Surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger
Consideration, any Fractional Share Proceeds or any distributions with
respect to SXCP Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of
such SXCP Certificate or Book-Entry SXCP Common Units would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such units, cash,
or distributions in respect of such SXCP Certificates or Book-Entry SXCP
Common Units shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication, such amounts, which may
include shares of Parent Common

 



16

    

 Stock, as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(g) _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(the " _Parent Stock Issuance Approval_ ") is the only vote or approval of
the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Parent necessary to

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and

fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls.

33

    

SECTION 5.3 _Certain Filings; Parent Stockholder
Meeting; Distributions_.

(a) _Preparation of Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy Statement_. As
promptly as practicable following the Execution Date (i) each of the SXCP
Parties and the Parent Parties agrees to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement (including the joint Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement constituting a part thereof (the " _Prospectus/Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement_ ")), (ii) Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE (subject, if applicable, to
notice of issuance) prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) the parties hereto
shall make all required filings under applicable state securities and "blue
sky" Laws; _provided, however_ , that no such filings shall be required in
any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, Parent would become subject to
general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a
foreign corporation doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of
such filing. Parent agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and SXCP agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
filing thereof and keep the Registration Statement effective until the earlier
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Holders of Parent Common Stock as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and SXCP shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Holders of SXCP Common Units as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and SXCP agrees to furnish to the other party all information
concerning the Parent Group Entities or the SXCP Group Entities,
as applicable, and to take such other action as may be reasonably requested
in connection with the foregoing. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy Statement
will be made by Parent or SXCP, in each case without providing the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(b)  _Information Supplied_. Each of the Parent Parties and the SXCP
Parties agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date the Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Holders of SXCP Common Units or Parent Common
Stock, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the Parent Parties and the SXCP Parties further agrees that, if it shall
become aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any
of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus/Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus/Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement.

 



34

    

(c) _SEC Correspondence_. Each of SXCP and Parent shall (i) promptly
notify the other of receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
other applicable government official and of any requests by the SEC or its
staff or any other applicable government official for amendments or
supplements to any of the filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby or for additional information and
(ii) promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between SXCP
or any of its representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as
the case may be, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other
applicable government official, on the other hand, with respect thereto.
Parent and SXCP shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Prospectus/Consent Statement/Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement as
promptly as practicable.

 

(d) _Parent Stockholder Meeting_. Parent shall, as soon as practicable
following the effective date of the Registration Statement, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval. Subject to _Section 5.3(e)_
and _Section 7.4(a)_, Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to
its stockholders approval of the Parent Stock Issuance (the " _Parent Board
Recommendation_ ") and shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to SXCP, such
recommendation or (ii) fail to include such Parent Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement (any such action being referred to herein as a " _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_ " _)_. Subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ and
_Section 7.4(a),_ Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the Parent Stock Issuance Approval. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article VII_ , the obligations of the Parent set forth in the first
sentence of this  _Section 5.3(d)_ shall not be affected by a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting (i) to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stock
Issuance Approval, (ii) in the absence of quorum, (iii) if Parent has
delivered any notice contemplated by _Section 5.3(e)_, and the time periods
contemplated by  _Section 5.3(e)_, have not expired, or (iv) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure that Parent has determined after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Laws and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided,
however_ , that in each case Parent shall not be permitted to postpone or
adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting for more than ten (10) Business Days
later than the most recently adjourned meeting or to a date after the date
that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date. No matter shall
be submitted for action at the Parent Stockholder Meeting other than the
approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and matters reasonably related to the
Parent Stock Issuance without the written consent of the SXCP Conflicts
Committee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



35

    

(e) _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Stock Issuance Approval, and subject to compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.3(e)_, the Parent Board may, if the Parent Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with the Parents financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law,
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided, however_ , that no
such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in response to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a Parent Designated
Proposal; _provided further, however_ , that the Parent Board may not effect
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) Parent has provided prior written notice to the SXCP Conflicts
Committee specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action
(including, in the case of a Parent Designated Proposal, a description of the
material terms of such Parent Designated Proposal and complete copies of any
written proposals, offers and/or draft definitive agreements in connection
therewith) at least three (3) days in advance of its intention to take such
action with respect to a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the
time such notice is required to be given there are less than three (3) days
prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting, in which case Parent shall provide as
much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such
days, the " _Parent Notice Period_ "); and

 

(ii) during the Parent Notice Period the Parent Board has negotiated, and
has used reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel to negotiate, with the SXCP Conflicts Committee in good faith
(to the extent the SXCP Conflicts Committee desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_
that any material amendment to the terms of a Parent Designated Proposal, if
applicable, shall require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ and
a new Parent Notice Period, except that such new Parent Notice Period in
connection with any material amendment shall be for one (1) Business Day from
the time SXCP receives such notice (as opposed to three (3) days).

(f) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_ , Parent shall submit the Parent Stock Issuance for approval at
the Parent Stockholder Meeting even if the Parent Board shall have effected a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

__SECTION 5.4 _ Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.
From and after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and (ii) defend any
lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability
of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing but subject to the other terms of
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that, from time to time, whether
before, at _ _

to be executed and delivered, such instruments of assignment, transfer,
conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization as may be necessary to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement except for _Section
5.3(e)_ will preclude any action (including the solicitation thereof) in
connection with a Parent Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Designated Proposal,
any action or failure to take any action, as expressly permitted by this
Agreement, require any party hereto to hold separate or make any divestiture
not expressly contemplated herein of any asset or require any party hereto to
otherwise agree to any restriction on its operations or other condition in
order to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance required by
this Agreement.

__SECTION 5.5 _ No Public Announcement_. On the Execution Date, Parent
and SXCP shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and SXCP. From and after the Execution Date, neither

SECTION 5.8 _Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for
purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S.
federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with
respect to Holders of SXCP Public Units, as a taxable sale of such
SXCP Common Units to a corporate subsidiary of Parent and (b) with respect to
such corporate subsidiary, as a purchase of SXCP Public Units from the Holders
of such SXCP Common Units. The Merger Consideration payable to the Holders of
SXCP Public Units shall be deemed to be (i) transferred from Parent to such
corporate subsidiary in a tax-free transaction pursuant to Section 351 of the
Code, and (ii) immediately thereafter transferred from such corporate
subsidiary to the Holders of SXCP Public Units in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The parties further agree that, pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.1032-3, the deemed transfer of the Merger Consideration
from such corporate subsidiary to the Holders of SXCP Public Units does not
trigger the recognition of gain by such corporate subsidiary. for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and the basis of Parent in stock of such corporate
subsidiary shall be increased by the value of the Merger Consideration. The
parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative
settlement with or final administrative decision by the relevant Governmental
Entity.

the SXCP Group Entities to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any
reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all
other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees,
travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and
courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending,
being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to

relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a SXCP DandO
Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any

acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and, upon receipt by Parent of
an undertaking by or on behalf of the SXCP DandO Indemnified Party to repay
such amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the SXCP DandO Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of expenses with
respect to each of the foregoing to all SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties and (ii)
honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of
liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) now existing in favor of the SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Governing Documents of any SXCP Group Entity, under
applicable Delaware Law or otherwise, and shall ensure that the Governing
Documents of SXCP and SXCP General Partner (or their successor entities)

 advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
elimination of liability and exculpation of their present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the Governing
Documents of SXCP and SXCP General Partner as of the Execution Date. Any right
of an SXCP DandO Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ shall not
be amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights of such SXCP DandO Indemnified
Party as provided herein, and shall be enforceable by such SXCP DandO
Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives against
Parent and SXCP General Partner and their respective successors and assigns.

Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to the Effective Time was
covered by the existing officers and directors liability insurance
applicable to the SXCP Group Entities (" _D andO Insurance_"), on terms
substantially no less advantageous to the SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, than such existing insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or
alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims,
actions or other Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for the
SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual premium
currently paid by the SXCP Group Entities for such insurance, but shall
purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such applicable amount.
Parent shall have the right to cause such coverage to be extended under
the applicable DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms
and conditions no less advantageous to the SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties than
the existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
the provisions of this _Section 5.9_.

(c) _Survival of Section 5.9_. The provisions of this  _Section 5.9_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for a period of six (6) years and expressly are
intended to benefit each of the SXCP DandO Indemnified Parties;  _provided,
however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification or
advancement set forth in this _Section 5.9_ are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims.
The rights of any SXCP DandO Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.9_ shall
be in addition to any other rights such SXCP DandO Indemnified Party may have
under the Governing Documents of any SXCP Group Entity or applicable Laws.

(d) _Assumption of Obligations_. In the event Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in either such case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that its successors and assigns, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

SECTION 5.10 _Distributions_. Until the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Parent will use its reasonable commercial
efforts to cause SXCP to declare and pay regular quarterly cash distributions
to Unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of 

 



39

    

 $0.40, with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly
distribution to occur no later than thirty-five (35) days and forty-seven (47)
days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter.

__SECTION 5.11 _ Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the SXCP Board and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of SXCP Common Units (including
derivative securities with respect to such SXCP Common Units) or acquisitions
of shares of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
to such shares of Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
SXCP, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. _ _

__SECTION 5.12 _ Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ , none of the SXCP
Group Entities shall, without the consent of the SXCP Conflicts Committee,

the SXCP Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the removal of any director
of the SXCP Board that is a member of the SXCP Conflicts Committee either as a
member of such board or such committee without the affirmative vote of the
members of the SXCP Board, including the affirmative vote of each of the
other members of the SXCP Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 5.12_ shall not apply to the filling in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Governing Documents of any vacancies caused by
the death, incapacity or resignation of any director. __

Agreement and the Support Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto and
thereto constitute the entire agreement between and among the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or other
agreements between or among the parties in connection with the subject matter
hereof except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby. Except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _IV_ ), (a) the parties acknowledge
and agree that neither the SXCP Group Entities nor any other Person has made,
and the Parent Group Entities are not relying upon, any covenant,
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the SXCP Group Entities
or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any SXCP
Group Entity furnished or made available to any Parent Group Entity, (b) the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as set forth in this
Agreement, neither the Parent Group Entities nor any other Person has made,
and the SXCP Group Entities are not relying upon, any covenant, representation
or warranty, express or implied, as to the Parent Group Entities or as to the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any Parent Group
Entity furnished or made available to any SXCP Group Entity, and (c) the SXCP
Parties and the Parent Parties shall not have or be subject to any liability
to any Parent Group Entity or any other Person or any SXCP Group Entity or any
other Person, as applicable, or any other remedy in connection herewith,
based upon the distribution to any Parent Group Entity or any SXCP Group
Entity of, or any Parent Group Entitys or any SXCP Group Entitys use of or
reliance on, any such information or any information, documents or material
made available to the Parent Group Parties or SXCP Group Parties, as
applicable, in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to compliance with applicable
Laws, prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may be (a)
consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by the provision or
(b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing by the parties
hereto; provided, however, that, in addition to any other approvals required
by the SXCP Parties constituent documents or under this Agreement,
the foregoing consents, waivers, amendments or modifications in clauses (a)
and (b), and any decision or determination by SXCP to (x) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ or (y) enforce this
Agreement, must be approved by the SXCP Conflicts Committee. No amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the parties hereto. The failure of a party to exercise
any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right
or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof
(regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

SECTION 8.4   _SXCP Board Consent_. Unless otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval or consent of
SXCP or SXCP General Partner is required pursuant to this Agreement, such
determination, decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the SXCP
Board; provided, however, that the SXCP Board may not take or authorize any
such action unless it has been approved in writing by the SXCP Conflicts
Committee.

SECTION 8.5 _Performance by SXCP General Partner_. Parent shall cause
SXCP General Partner to cause SXCP and its Subsidiaries to comply with the
provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood
and agreed that actions or inactions by SXCP, SXCP General Partner and
their respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be breaches or
violations or failures to perform by SXCP, SXCP General Partner and their
respective Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of this Agreement if such
action or inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the direction of
Parent or its representatives.

SECTION 8.6 _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and
Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement,
except (i) as provided in _Section 5.9_ and (ii) for the right of the Holders
of SXCP Public Units to receive the Merger Consideration (as well as any
Fractional Share Proceeds) after the Closing (a claim by the Holders of SXCP
Public Units with respect to which may not be made unless and until the
Closing shall have occurred). No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of
or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or
otherwise). Any attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in
violation of this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

 

SECTION 8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Laws, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any matter materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 8.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one instrument. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document
format" (".pdf"), or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.
