Schedule 1.6: Resigning Officers

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 8, 2014 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and among Active Aero Group Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Project Falcon Merger Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
Project Laser Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in
its capacity as the Representative. Unless the context otherwise makes clear,
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in ARTICLE X.

BACKGROUND

A. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the
Merger.

B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and declaring its advisability, (ii)
approving the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii)
determining that the terms of the Merger are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and the Stockholders, (iv) directing that this
Agreement be submitted to the Stockholders for consideration for adoption or
rejection and (v) recommending that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement.

C. The Boards of Directors of both Parent and Merger Sub have each unanimously
adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and authorizing Parent
and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, and
Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted
this Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.

D. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a written consent of the
Majority Stockholder adopting this Agreement and approving the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

E. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger as provided herein.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the Parties
hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1.The Merger. At the Effective Time, and subject to and on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

1.2.Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to ARTICLE
VII, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall
take place via the electronic exchange of signature pages between the Parties
at 10:00 a.m., Michigan time, on a date to be designated by Parent, which
shall be no later than the second (2nd) Business Day, following the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such
time), or at such other time and place as shall be agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

1.3.Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, concurrently
with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, the Parties shall file
with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") duly executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to
give full effect to the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.4.Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.5.Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety by the Certificate
of Merger to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Active Aero
Group Holdings, Inc.", and (ii) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation as stated in such bylaws
shall be "Active Aero Group Holdings, Inc.".

1.6.Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation at
the Effective Time, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than those officers set forth on Schedule 1.6 hereto who
shall cease to be officers of the Company at the Effective Time, shall become
the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold
office from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1.Conversion of Company Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
any Stockholder or any other Person:

(a)Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.2, each share
of the Company's Class A Voting Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
each share of the Company's Class B Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share (collectively, "Company Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive, without interest, an amount equal to (i) the Initial Per Share Merger
Consideration when and as provided in Section 2.3, plus (ii) the payments, if
any, to be made with respect to such share of Company Common Stock from the
Representative Holdback Account when and as provided in Section 2.6, plus
(iii) the payments, if any, to be made with respect to such share of Company
Common Stock when and as provided in Sections 2.5(d), 9.1(d), 9.1(e) and
11.1(d) (taken together, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). (b)Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company (or held in the
treasury of the Company) or any direct or indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company and each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent shall be
automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment or
other consideration shall be made with respect thereto.

(c)Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so
that, at the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation's common stock.

2.2.Dissenting Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration but instead shall be entitled to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the rights set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal under
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal, each such share
of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if it had been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
and when provided in Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of (x) any demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, (y) withdrawals of such demands,
and (z) any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company in connection with such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to
any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.3.Payments to the Stockholders.

(a)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall distribute to each Stockholder
of record a customary letter of transmittal in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent (the "Letter of Transmittal") for use in surrendering the
Certificates held by such Stockholder (or in lieu thereof an Affidavit of Loss
as provided in Section 2.3(e)) in exchange for the payments provided for in
this Agreement.

(b)Each Stockholder who has, prior to the Effective Time, properly completed,
executed and delivered to the Company (who shall promptly thereafter deliver a
copy of such documents to Parent) a Letter of Transmittal and the
Certificate(s) evidencing such Stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock
(or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled to receive from
Parent at the Closing, and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to each such
Stockholder at the Closing, an amount equal to the Initial Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by the Certificate(s) surrendered by such Stockholder (or referred
to in the Affidavit of Loss delivered by such Stockholder in lieu thereof).
All such payments pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be made by check or by
wire transfer as requested by such Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal
delivered by such Stockholder.

(c)With respect to each Stockholder who has not properly completed, executed
and delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Company prior to the Effective
Time, or who has failed to deliver the Certificate(s) evidencing such
Stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock (or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu
thereof), at the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to an
account specified by the Representative not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the "Stockholder Payment Account") an amount equal
to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock held by all such Stockholders (other than
Dissenting Shares), such funds to be held by the Representative in trust in
the Stockholder Payment Account (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar Laws) for distribution to each such Stockholder when and
as each such Stockholder delivers a properly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and the Certificate(s) evidencing such Stockholder's shares of
Company Common Stock (or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) to the
Representative (who shall promptly thereafter deliver such documents to
Parent), at which time the Representative shall distribute or cause to be
distributed to such Stockholder from the funds held by the Representative in
the Stockholder Payment Account the same amount (payable in the same manner)
as such Stockholder would have received from Parent under Section 2.3(b) if
such Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s) (or Affidavit of Loss in lieu
thereof) had been delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time.
Following the Closing, any such Stockholder shall be entitled to look only to
the Representative and the funds in the Stockholder Payment Account (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) and only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the amount that such Stockholder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) upon delivery to the Representative of a properly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and the Certificate(s) evidencing such
Stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock (or an Affidavit of Loss in lieu
thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Representative shall be liable to any
Stockholder for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(d)In addition to the payments to be made to the Stockholders as provided in
Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), the Stockholders shall also be entitled to
receive the payments, if any, to be made with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock (i) from the Representative Holdback Account when and as provided
in Section 2.6, and (ii) when and as provided in Sections 2.5(d), 9.1(d),
9.1(e) and 11.1(d).

(e)If any Certificate held by any Stockholder shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, such Stockholder may, in lieu of delivering such Certificate with
the Letter of Transmittal delivered in accordance with Section 2.3(b) or
Section 2.3(c), complete, execute and deliver to the Company or the
Representative, as applicable, an affidavit of loss and indemnity in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (an "Affidavit of Loss").

(f)If payment of any portion of the amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person
requesting such payment (i) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, and shall have established
to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid, or (ii) shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable.

(g)In no event shall any Stockholder be entitled to receive interest on any of
the funds to be received in connection with the Merger.

(h)At the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, and each Certificate shall thereafter
represent the right to receive, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the
consideration referred to in Section 2.1(a) payable with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock, without interest, upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided
herein, or, if such shares of Company Common Stock are Dissenting Shares, the
rights set forth in Section 2.2 hereof; and (ii) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time.

2.4.Other Payments by Parent at the Closing. At the Closing, Parent shall make
or cause to be made the following payments by wire transfer of immediately
available funds:

(a)On the Company's behalf, to the holders of the Closing Debt, the amount
necessary to repay in full all such Closing Debt as set forth in the Payoff
Letters to be delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to this Agreement,
such payments to be remitted to the accounts and in the amounts specified in
such Payoff Letters.

(b)On the Company's behalf, the amount necessary to pay the Unpaid Transaction
Expenses (other than the Phantom Plan Amount and the Transaction Bonus
Amount), such payments to be remitted to the accounts and in the amounts
specified by the Company not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(c)To the Surviving Corporation, the Phantom Plan Amount and the Transaction
Bonus Amount. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event later than the first full payroll cycle following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each Phantom Plan Recipient the Initial
Phantom Plan Payment payable to each such Phantom Plan Recipient pursuant to
the Phantom Plan and shall pay the Transaction Bonuses to the recipients
thereof, in each case to the Persons and in the amounts set forth in the
Phantom Plan and Transaction Bonus Schedule. The payments described in the
preceding sentence shall be effected through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll processes.

(d)To the Representative, the Representative Holdback Amount, such payment to
be remitted to an account specified by the Representative not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Representative Holdback
Account").

2.5.Closing Statement; Post-Closing Payments.

(a)At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a statement (the "Closing Statement") executed by the
Company setting forth (i) the Company's good faith estimate of (A) the Closing
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), (B) the
Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (C) the Closing Debt (the
"Estimated Closing Debt") and (D) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the
"Estimated Unpaid Transaction Expenses"), which Closing Statement shall quantify in reasonable detail the
items constituting such Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated
Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Debt and Estimated Unpaid Transaction
Expenses, and in each case calculated in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, a
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Initial Per Share
Merger Consideration. All such estimates shall be subject to Parent's review
and shall control solely for purposes of determining the amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.4(a) and 2.4(b) and shall not limit or
otherwise affect Parent's remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, or
constitute an acknowledgement by Parent of the accuracy of the amounts
reflected thereof.

(b)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Final Closing Statement")
executed by Parent setting forth (i) Parent's determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Transaction Expenses,
which Final Closing Statement shall quantify in reasonable detail the items
constituting such Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and
Unpaid Transaction Expenses reflected in the Final Closing Statement, and in
each case calculated in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Final
Merger Consideration.

(c)The Final Closing Statement and the calculation of the Final Merger
Consideration set forth therein shall be final and binding on the Parties and
the Stockholders unless the Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders,
delivers to Parent, within sixty (60) days following the Representative's
receipt of the Final Closing Statement (the "Objection Period"), a written
notice (the "Objection Notice") advising Parent that the Representative
disputes Parent's calculations set forth in the Final Closing Statement. Such
Objection Notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in
reasonable detail, identifying the specific items as to which the
Representative disagrees and shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation. During the Objection Period, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide the Representative and the
Representative's advisors with reasonable access (including on-site access and
electronic access to the extent available) during regular business hours and
upon reasonable notice to all relevant books and records and employees
(including key accounting and finance personnel) of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably necessary to review the matters
and information used to prepare and to support the Final Closing Statement,
all in a manner not unreasonably interfering with the business of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. All fees, costs and expenses of
the Representative relating to the review of the Final Closing Statement shall
be borne by the Stockholders out of the Representative Holdback Account and
all fees, costs and expenses of Parent or the Surviving Corporation relating
thereto shall be borne by Parent. If the Representative timely delivers an
Objection Notice during the Objection Period pursuant to this Section 2.5(c),
then the Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to resolve all such matters identified in such Objection
Notice. If the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within thirty (30) days after the receipt by Parent of the
Objection Notice (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing by Parent
and the Representative), then the remaining disputed matters (the "Disputed
Matters") shall be promptly submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for binding
resolution. The Accounting Arbitrator will consider only the Disputed Matters
and shall resolve such Disputed Matters in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a written
report setting forth its determination with respect to the Disputed Matters
and the Final Merger Consideration, which determination shall be final and
binding upon the Parties and the Stockholders. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator incurred in connection with the determination of the
Disputed Matters and the Final Merger Consideration shall be paid by Parent
and by the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders, to be paid from the
Representative Holdback Account) based on the relative success of their
positions as compared to the final determination of the Accounting Arbitrator.
By way of example, if Parent has taken the position that the Final Merger
Consideration was $1,000,000 less than the Estimated Merger Consideration and
the Representative has taken the position that the Final Merger Consideration
was $500,000 greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, and the
Accounting Arbitrator finally determines that the Final Merger Consideration
was equal to the Estimated Merger Consideration, then Parent shall pay two
thirds of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) shall pay one third of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. Parent and the Representative
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate fully
with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to all requests
for information or access to documents or personnel made by the Accounting
Arbitrator, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve the
Disputed Matters as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(d)If the Final Merger Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.5(c), is less than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then the
Representative shall pay to Parent the amount of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds from the Representative Holdback
Account within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of such
Final Merger Consideration; provided, however, that if the amount of such
difference is greater than the amount of funds then remaining in the
Representative Holdback Account (such amount, the "Shortfall Amount"), then
(i) the Representative shall pay to Parent the amount then remaining in the
Representative Holdback Account and (ii) the Stockholders shall severally (in
accordance with each Stockholder's Equity Ownership Percentage), and not
jointly, pay to Parent the Shortfall Amount, each within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of such Final Merger Consideration. If the
Final Merger Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with Section
2.5(c), is greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Representative (for
further payment to the Stockholders, subject to Section 11.1(c), in accordance
with their respective Equity Ownership Percentages and the payment
instructions set forth in their respective Letters of Transmittal) the amount
of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five
(5) Business Days after the final determination of such Final Merger
Consideration.

2.6.Payments from the Representative Holdback Account. The Representative
shall retain custody over the funds in the Representative Holdback Account
until all payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.5(d) have been made. After
such time, the Representative shall pay any funds that remain in the
Representative Holdback Account to the Stockholders, in accordance with their
respective Equity Ownership Percentages and the payment instructions set forth
in their respective Letters of Transmittal, at such time or times as the
Representative shall reasonably determine to be appropriate, taking into
account the provisions of Section 11.1(c).

2.7.Additional Payments to Phantom Plan Recipients. From time to time
following the Closing, upon the written request of the Representative
delivered to the Surviving Corporation and in accordance with, and subject to,
this Section 2.7, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each Phantom Plan
Recipient specified by the Representative in such written request the amount
or amounts requested by the Representative in such written request. The
payment of such amounts shall be effected through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll processes as part of the first full payroll cycle occurring more than
seven (7) Business Days following the delivery of such written request to the
Surviving Corporation. The Representative shall pay to the Surviving
Corporation by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the date of such payroll cycle (i) the aggregate
amount of such requested payments, plus (ii) the aggregate Transaction Payroll
Taxes to be incurred in connection with such requested payments.

2.8.Withholding; Deductions. Each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement any withholding Taxes or
other amounts required by Law to be deducted and withheld. To the extent that
any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid prior to the Closing to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The
Company or its Subsidiaries shall claim all income Tax deductions permitted to
be claimed by Law (with substantial authority) with respect to the payment of
any Transaction Expenses and the payment of any Closing Debt at or after the
Closing pursuant to Sections 2.4(a), 2.4(b) and 2.4(c) in the final Tax
Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date, and Parent shall not take any action, or permit the Surviving
Corporation to take any action, inconsistent therewith.

2.9.Further Action. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of
and to all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be empowered to take such action, so long as such action is
not inconsistent with this Agreement.

cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the six (6)-month period
then ended (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"). The Company
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that the unaudited
interim Company Financial Statements do not contain footnotes and are subject
to normal year-end adjustments, none of which are reasonably expected to have
a material impact on the results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company Financial Statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods

the accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising since the
Balance Sheet Date, arose from bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business, and the goods and services involved have been sold, delivered and
performed to the account obligors, and no further filings (with governmental
agencies, insurers or others) are required to be made, no further goods are
required to be provided and no further services are required to be rendered to
properly reflect such accounts receivable on a balance sheet in accordance
with GAAP; provided, however, that there is no guaranty or assurance that any
accounts receivable of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will actually be
collected. No such account has been assigned or pledged to any Person and,
except only to the extent fully reserved against as set forth on the Company
Balance Sheet, no defense or set-off to any such account has been asserted by
the account obligor or exists.

(c)The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain in all material respects an
adequate system of internal controls and procedures of the accounting
practices, procedures and policies employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Since the Acquisition Date, there have not been any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the financial reporting of the Company
and its Subsidiaries which are or were reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, or any fraud (whether or not material) that involved
management or other employees who have or had a significant role in financial
reporting.

other representations and warranties of the Company included in this ARTICLE

whether or not of a nature required to be reflected or reserved against in a
balance sheet in accordance with GAAP).

3.9.Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) there have
not been any events, occurrences, changes, developments or circumstances that
had, or would reasonably be anticipated to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action of the type referred to in Section 5.1 that would require the consent
of Parent under Section 5.1 if proposed to be taken after the date hereof.

3.10.Title to Assets and Properties; Equipment and Other Tangible Properties.

(a)The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to, or, in the
case of leased properties and assets, a valid leasehold interest in, or
otherwise have a valid legal right to use, all of their respective material
tangible personal assets and properties (i) reflected on the Company Balance
Sheet, other than assets and properties disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since the Balance Sheet Date, or (ii) necessary to conduct the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted. All of said properties and assets that are owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are owned free and clear of any Liens, other than
Permitted Liens.

aircraft, engines, spare parts, structures, fixtures and other tangible
property of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Tangible Company
Properties") are (i) in good operating condition and repair consistent with

such Tangible Company Properties as shall have been taken out of service on a
temporary basis for repairs or replacement consistent with the prior practices
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and normal industry standards, and (ii) in
compliance in all material respects with all federal and state safety
standards. To the Company's Knowledge, the Tangible Company Properties are
free of any structural or engineering defects, and since the Acquisition Date
there has not been any significant interruption of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries due to inadequate maintenance or obsolescence of the
Tangible Company Properties.

3.11.Owned and Leased Real Property.

(a)Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter contains a list of each lease or
license pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases or
licenses the use or occupancy of any real property as of the date of this
Agreement (each, a "Lease" and, such real property, the "Leased Real
Property"). Each Lease is valid and binding on the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the Company's Knowledge, each other party
thereto, and is in full force and effect. There is no material breach or
default under any Lease by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Company's Knowledge, any other party thereto. No event has occurred that with
or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute
a material breach or default under any Lease by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party thereto. The
Company or one of its Subsidiaries that is either the tenant or licensee named
under a Lease has a good and valid leasehold interest in each parcel of real
property that is subject to the Lease and is in possession of the properties
purported to be leased or licensed thereunder. Neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective authorized agents or employees has received written notice of any claimed abatements, offsets,
defenses or other bases for relief or adjustment with respect to any Lease.

(b)Section 3.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter contains a list of all real
property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real
Property"). The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable fee
simple title to the Owned Real Property and to all of the buildings,
structures and other improvements thereon free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens. There are no outstanding agreements, options, rights of
first offer or rights of first refusal on the part of any Person to purchase
any Owned Real Property.

(c)With respect to each Leased Real Property and Owned Real Property, (i)
there are no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, contemplated, rezoning or
special designation proceedings affecting any of the Leased Real Property or
the Owned Real Property, (ii) there are no pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened, condemnation proceedings related to any of the Leased
Real Property or the Owned Real Property, and (iii) all of the buildings,
structures, appurtenances and other improvements situated on any of the Leased
Real Property or the Owned Real Property have been maintained in accordance
with the Company's usual business practices, and are in good operating
condition and in a state of good maintenance and repair, are adequate for the
purposes for which they are presently being used and, with respect to each,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have adequate rights of ingress and egress
for operation of their respective businesses in the ordinary course of
business, and none of such buildings, structures, appurtenances, fixtures or
other improvements, nor the operation or maintenance thereof, violates any
restrictive covenant, applicable building, zoning or other land-use Laws.

3.12.Intellectual Property.

(a)Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Letter (i) sets forth a list and
description of all Registered Intellectual Property included in the Company
Intellectual Property and (ii) specifies, where applicable, the jurisdictions
in which any Registered Intellectual Property has been registered or in which
an application for such registration has been filed, including the respective
registration or application numbers and the names of all registered owners.
The Company Intellectual Property includes all intellectual property rights
necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as
presently being conducted. No interest in the Company Intellectual Property
has been assigned, transferred, licensed or sublicensed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to any Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all legal requirements applicable to
the Company Intellectual Property and the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
ownership and use thereof.

(b)The Company and its Subsidiaries are the sole owners of all right, title
and interest in and to the Registered Intellectual Property owned by them, and
all governmental fees as well as all registration, maintenance and renewal
fees associated therewith and due as of the date hereof have been paid in
full. With respect to the Registered Intellectual Property, such
registrations, filings or issuances were duly made and remain in full force
and effect. With respect to all Company Intellectual Property, the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries either owns such Company Intellectual Property free
and clear of any and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) or, with respect
to the Company Intellectual Property which is not owned by the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries are validly
licensed or otherwise possess valid and enforceable rights to use such Company
Intellectual Property as currently used in the conduct of business operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No royalties, honorariums or fees are
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person by reason of
the ownership or use of any of the Company Intellectual Property.

(c)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries in the operation of its
businesses, no service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no
utilization of the Company Intellectual Property by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries infringes, violates or misappropriates the
intellectual property rights of any third party. Since the Acquisition Date,
there have been no claims made against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
asserting the infringement, violation, misappropriation, invalidity, abuse,
misuse or unenforceability of any of the Company Intellectual Property and, to
the Company's Knowledge, no grounds for any such claims exist. Since the
Acquisition Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice that it is in conflict with or infringing upon the asserted
intellectual property rights of others in connection with the Company
Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
made any claim of any violation or infringement by others of any of the
Company Intellectual Property or interests therein and, to the Company's
Knowledge, no grounds for any such claims exist.

(d)Section 3.12(d) of the Disclosure Letter identifies all license agreements
as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use, or
authorizes any third party to use, any Company Intellectual Property (other
than commercial off-the-shelf software licenses). None of the Company or its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party or parties
thereto, is in violation or default in any material respect of any such
license agreements. (e)No former or current employees, agents, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company or its Subsidiaries have (i) asserted any claim
against the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such Person's
involvement in the conception and development of any Intellectual Property,
and, to the Company's Knowledge, no such claim has been threatened, or (ii)
been named as an inventor on any patent owned by, or pending patent
application by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any device,
process, design or invention of any kind now used or needed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in the furtherance of their businesses, except for inventions
that have been assigned to the Company or its Subsidiaries, with an assignment
thereof duly recorded in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

(f)The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures
to protect and maintain their trade secrets and confidential information,

each of the Other Person Authorizations will continue in full force and effect
following the Closing without (A) the occurrence of any breach, default or
forfeiture of rights thereunder, or (B) the consent, approval or act of, or

underwriters of such policies or bonds and, to the Company's Knowledge, there

payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid (or if installment
payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing) and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in material compliance with the
terms of such policies. None of the insurance carriers has provided written
(or, to the Company's Knowledge, oral) notice to the Company or any of its

Agreement, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
provide any Party with a right to review any such information provided to any
Governmental Entity on a confidential basis in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties may also,
as each deems reasonably necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

effect for six (6) years after the Effective Time, insurance "tail" or other
insurance policies with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
coverage applicable to directors and officers as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (the "DandO Tail Policy"). (d)The provisions of this Section 5.4 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the Covered Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or

Persons.

5.5.Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a)For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, Parent
shall maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, the employee
benefit plans of the Company in existence on the Closing Date or otherwise
make available to the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries benefit plans, programs and arrangements with benefits that are
not less favorable in the aggregate and on terms that are not less favorable
in the aggregate than the benefit programs and arrangements made available to
such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of
determining eligibility to participate and vesting of benefits (but not
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan nor vesting for
purposes of any equity or equity-based compensation program) under Parent's or
the Surviving Corporation's employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements,
each such employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date and the Surviving
Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to provide that any pre-existing
conditions, actively-at-work, or similar requirements under any such benefit
plans, programs or arrangements be waived by the plan sponsor with respect to
such employees to the extent allowed thereunder and under applicable Law.
Nothing in this Section 5.5(a) shall be interpreted as requiring the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
employee for any specified period of time.

(b)The Company shall, prior to the Closing, execute and deliver to each
Phantom Plan Recipient a Memorandum of Understanding, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (a "Phantom Plan MOU"). During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Phantom Plan
Recipient to duly execute and deliver to the Company at or prior to the
Closing such Phantom Plan Recipient's Phantom Plan MOU. The Company shall make
available to Parent at or prior to the Closing a copy of each Phantom Plan MOU
that has been duly executed and delivered to the Company by the Phantom Plan
Recipients.

(c)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all action necessary and
appropriate to terminate the Phantom Plan, such termination to be effective at
or before the Effective Time.

(d)At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a schedule (the "Phantom Plan and Transaction Bonus

destroyed, or permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
destroy or cause to be destroyed, any material books or records relating to
the pre-Closing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without
first obtaining the consent of the Representative (or providing to the
Representative notice of such intent and a reasonable opportunity to copy such
books or records, at the Stockholders' expense, at least thirty (30) days
prior to such destruction). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall allow
the Representative to have access to such books and records for all reasonable
purposes.

5.7.Bonus Payments. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the management
bonus plan of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014 as in
effect as of the date hereof and shall perform its obligations to pay bonuses
thereunder to the Persons eligible for bonuses under such plan in accordance
with the terms of such plan, which Persons and terms have been made available
to Parent. The aggregate amount of all such bonuses awarded under such plan
shall not be less than the aggregate amount accrued for such bonuses and
included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.5(c).

5.8.Notice Regarding Changes. The Company shall promptly inform Parent in
writing of any change in facts and circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to render any of the representations and warranties made herein by
the Company inaccurate or misleading in any material respect if such
representations and warranties had been made as of the date of the occurrence
of the fact or circumstance in question. Parent shall promptly inform the
Company in writing of any change in facts and circumstances that could
reasonably be expected to render any of the representations and warranties
made herein by Parent or Merger Sub inaccurate or misleading in any material
respect if such representations and warranties had been made as of the date of
the occurrence of the fact or circumstance in question. 5.9.Insurance Policies. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any and all insurance coverage currently carried by or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to remain in full force and
effect prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Company shall
cooperate with Parent to cause termination as of the Closing Date of the
insurance coverage identified in writing for this purpose by Parent to the
Company.

the Minority Stockholders (as defined therein) (x) vote all of the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by them in favor of adopting this Agreement and
approving the Merger and (y) waive any dissenters' rights, appraisal rights or
similar rights which they may have under applicable Law, including under
Section 262 of the DGCL, with respect to the Merger (the "Stockholder
Notice"). Parent shall have a right to review and comment upon the Stockholder
Notice prior to any delivery of the Stockholder Notice to any Stockholder, and
the Company shall consider in good faith any comments made by Parent on the
Stockholder Notice. The Board shall not alter, modify, change or revoke its
unanimous approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor its unanimous recommendation to the Stockholders to
vote in favor of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

5.11.Payoff Letters. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Parent with customary payoff letters ("Payoff
Letters") from all holders of Debt, if any (which Payoff Letters shall contain

repayment of all such Debt, recordable form lien releases (and/or, if
requested by Parent, an authorization for the Company, Parent or Parent's
lender to file UCC termination statements), canceled notes and other documents
reasonably requested by Parent.

5.12.Non-Solicitation Agreement. The Company shall, at or prior to the
Closing, deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a non-solicitation
agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, dated as of the Closing
Date and duly executed by the Majority Stockholder (the "Non-Solicitation
Agreement").

5.13.General Release. The Company shall, at or prior to the Closing, deliver
or cause to be delivered to Parent a general release in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C, dated as of the Closing Date and duly executed by the
Majority Stockholder (the "General Release").

5.14.Resignations. The Company shall, at or prior to the Closing, deliver or
cause to be delivered to Parent the resignation of (a) the officers of the

its Subsidiaries.

5.15.No Solicitation.

(a)During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its
Subsidiaries' directors, officers or other employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, representatives, or other agents including its financial, legal or
accounting advisors (together, "Company Representatives") to, and the Company
shall instruct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to instruct, each such
Company Representative (other than Affiliates) not to, directly or indirectly
(i) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, promote, formally approve or
support any inquiry, proposal or offer from, (ii) furnish any non-public
information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than in
connection with the sale of products and services in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice) to, or (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, any corporation, limited liability company,
general or limited partnership, business trust, unincorporated association or other entity, Person or group of
any of the foregoing (other than Parent and its representatives acting in
their capacities as such) regarding (A) any acquisition of all or any part of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including by way of any merger or
consolidation with or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or any
acquisition, issuance, grant, sale or transfer of any of the securities,
business, properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the sale of products and services in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), (B) any joint venture or other
strategic investment in or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than a commercial or strategic relationship in the ordinary course of
business), including any new financing, investment round or recapitalization
of the Company, (C) the employment of all or substantially all of the
employees, contractors and consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
(D) any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is not in the ordinary course of business (each, an
"Alternative Transaction"). The Company hereby agrees that any action taken by
one or more of its Company Representatives that would constitute a breach of
this Section 5.15(a) if taken by the Company will constitute a breach of this
Section 5.15(a) by the Company.

(b)At all times during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent if the Company or any of its Company Representatives receives
any offer or proposal regarding or relating to a potential Alternative
Transaction, which notice shall include the identity of the party making any
such communication, offer or proposal, the specific terms of such
communication, offer or proposal, as the case may be (including a copy of any
written material and electronic communications received from such party), and
such other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably request.

(c)The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur, and that
monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, in the event that the
provisions of this Section 5.15 were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agrees
that Parent shall be entitled to injunctive relief in the event of a breach of
this Section 5.15, including an injunction to prevent any continuing breach or
violation of the provisions of this Section 5.15, and the remedy of specific
performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Section
5.15 in any court of the U.S. or any state having jurisdiction. The Company
also agrees that Parent shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such injunction or order or decree of specific
performance or in connection with any related legal proceeding. The foregoing
remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach or
violation of this Agreement, but shall instead be in addition to any and all
other remedy or remedies to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.

5.16.Section 280G Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall submit to a stockholder vote (along with adequate
disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the
Code and any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any
"disqualified individual" with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive
any payment that would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) and as to which such individual waives
his or her rights as described in the following sentence in a manner that
satisfies the stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code and any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent
necessary to cause any such payment to not constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. To the extent
that any such "disqualified individual" has the right to receive payments that
could constitute "parachute payments" and elects to waive such rights, the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall obtain waivers of
such rights prior to soliciting the vote described in the immediately
preceding sentence such that the vote shall, if successful, establish each
"disqualified individual's" right to the payment. At least three (3) days
prior to execution, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to Parent a draft of all stockholder vote related documents,
including any disclosure documents, "disqualified individual" waivers, and the
underlying analysis used to prepare such documents. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall incorporate any reasonable comments that are made by
Parent. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with
the preparation of such shareholder vote related documents.

5.17.Access to Assets. The Representative shall at all times following the
Closing maintain funds, or access to capital, sufficient to meet its
obligations under this Agreement in its capacity as the Majority Stockholder.

(a)by written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b)by either Parent or the Company if (i) the Closing has not occurred by
December 31, 2014 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available

exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) prior to the earlier of the Outside
Date or that date which is fifteen (15) days following the Company's receipt
of written notice from Parent of such breach, it being understood that Parent
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if such
breach by the Company is cured within such fifteen (15) day period so that
such conditions would then be satisfied; or

(d)by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under

however, that if such breach is curable by Parent prior to the Outside Date
through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) prior to the
earlier of the Outside Date or that date which is fifteen (15) days following
Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach, it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

further force or effect, except that (i) this Section 7.2 and ARTICLE XI shall
survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall
relieve any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement. ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1.Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate,
document or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to this Agreement, shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such twelve (12)-month period, the
"Expiration Date"); provided, however, that in the event of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation with respect to a representation or warranty,
such representation or warranty shall survive for the applicable statute of
limitations for such a claim; provided, further, that (a) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.1 (Organization and
Qualification of the Company), Section 3.2 (Organization and Qualification of
Subsidiaries), Section 3.3 (Capitalization), Section 3.4 (Authority), Section
3.5(b) (No Conflict with Constitutional Documents) and Section 3.25 (Brokers'
and Finders' Fees) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall
survive for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date; (b) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.21 (Tax

certificate, document or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement, other than the Fundamental
Representations, the Tax Representations and the Environmental Representations
are sometimes referred to herein as the "Business Representations"); and
provided, further, that all representations and warranties of the Company
shall survive beyond the Expiration Date or other survival periods specified
above with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof if a claim is
made hereunder in writing setting forth the specific claim and the basis
therefor prior to the expiration of the survival period for such
representation and warranty, in which case such representation and warranty
shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the

writing setting forth the specific claim and the basis therefor prior to the
expiration of the survival period for such representation and warranty, in
which case such representation and warranty shall survive as to such claim
until such claim has been finally resolved. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival
periods and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations
that would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties.

8.2.Indemnification.

(a)Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE VIII, the Stockholders
shall severally (in accordance with each Stockholder's Equity Ownership
Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent,

Taxes, incurred or suffered by any such Parent Indemnified Parties directly or
indirectly as a result of, with respect to or in connection with:

made by the Company in this Agreement (it being agreed that, for purposes of
this ARTICLE VIII, all qualifications and exceptions relating to materiality,

covenant set forth herein to be performed, fulfilled or complied with by the
Company prior to the Effective Time;

consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all
attorneys' and consultants' fees, costs and expenses and including any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending against or settling any action or proceeding in respect of
Dissenting Shares.

(b)Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE VIII, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholders and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, agents and Affiliates (the "Company Indemnified Parties")
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such Company
Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to or
in connection with any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to fully perform,
fulfill or comply with any covenant set forth herein to be performed,
fulfilled or complied with by Parent or Merger Sub at any time.

8.3.Limitations on Liability; RandW Insurance Policy; Claims Procedure.

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholders shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement with respect to a breach of,
or inaccuracy in, any or all of the Business Representations only if and to
the extent that (i) the aggregate of all of their liability under such
indemnity obligations pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement with
respect to any individual claim for a breach of, or inaccuracy in, a Business
Representation (or series of related claims) exceeds $20,000 (a "Qualifying
Claim") and (ii) the aggregate of all of their liability under such indemnity
obligations pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) with respect to all Qualifying
Claims exceeds $1,150,000 (the "Deductible"); provided, however, that in no
event shall the aggregate liability of the Stockholders pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement (x) with respect to a breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any or all of the Business Representations exceed $575,000, and (y) with
respect to a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any or all of the Fundamental
Representations, the Tax Representations and the Environmental Representations
exceed $1,725,000 (the "Stockholder Payment Caps").

(b)The amount of Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII shall be calculated net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Parent Indemnified Party under insurance policies (other than the RandW
Insurance Policy) with respect to such Losses (net of any costs to recover
such insurance payments and any increased premiums resulting therefrom).
Except with respect to the calculation of the threshold amounts set forth in
Sections 8.3(a)(i) and (a)(ii), the amount of Losses for which indemnification
is provided under this ARTICLE VIII shall be calculated net of any Tax
benefits actually realized by Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Taxable period that includes the indemnity payment, any carryback Tax
period prior to such Taxable period, or the two (2) Tax years immediately
following such Taxable period (solely through a reduction in cash Tax payments
required to be made or an increase in Tax refunds actually received), which
Tax benefits shall be calculated net of any cash Tax costs, in each case, as a
result of the Losses or receipt of an indemnity payment on a claim therefor.

(c)Parent and the Stockholders acknowledge that Parent has obtained the RandW
Insurance Policy for coverage of the Stockholders' indemnification obligations
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) with respect to the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement without regard to the
Stockholder Payment Caps. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, with respect to Losses relating to a breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any or all of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered
by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement in excess of the
Stockholder Payment Caps, the Parent Indemnified Persons' sole and exclusive
recourse for the Stockholders' indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) shall be limited to the extent of the coverage provided under the
RandW Insurance Policy.

(d)Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party more than once, regardless of
whether such Losses may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty or covenant; provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation shall not prevent an Indemnified Party from recovering all Losses
to which it is entitled hereunder arising out of the same set of facts,
events, conditions or circumstances (but not more than once) notwithstanding
the fact that an indemnification claim for such Losses is based upon more than
one representation, warranty or covenant.

(e)No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement with respect to Losses arising in connection with a breach
of or any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or Tax Losses if and to the extent that
the alleged breach or Tax Loss relates to a balance sheet asset or liability
that was reflected in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital.

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover under the RandW
Insurance Policy and under ARTICLE IX, the remedies provided in this ARTICLE
VIII shall be the exclusive monetary remedies of the parties hereto and their
heirs, successors and assigns after the Closing with respect to a breach of,
or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement, except for (i) for actions for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief,
and (ii) claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in any which case
the parties shall have all rights and remedies available under this Agreement
and available under any Law.

(g)For purposes of this Section 8.3(g), a party making a claim for indemnity
under Section 8.2 is hereinafter referred to as an "Indemnified Party" and the
party against whom such claim is asserted is hereinafter referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party." All claims by any Indemnified Party under Section 8.2
hereof shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with the following
provisions. If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be
liable to an Indemnified Party is asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party by a third party, said Indemnified Party shall
with reasonable promptness notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of such
claim or demand stating with reasonable specificity the nature of each
individual item of Loss included in such claim, the date (if any) such item
was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the
nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant or claim to which each such item is related and, to the extent
computable, the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party
claims to be entitled hereunder; provided, however, that any failure to give
such notice will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party except to the
extent the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually prejudiced or to the
extent that any applicable period set forth in Section 8.1 has expired without
such notice being given. After receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such
notice, then upon reasonable notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party, or upon the request of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall defend, manage and conduct any proceedings,
negotiations or communications involving any claimant whose claim is the
subject of the Indemnified Party's notice to the Indemnifying Party as set
forth above, and shall take all actions necessary, including the posting of
such bond or other security as may be required by any Governmental Entity, so
as to enable the claim to be defended against or resolved without expense or
other action by the Indemnified Party. Upon the request of the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent it may legally do so and to
the extent that it is reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses thereby incurred,

(i)take such action as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in
connection with such action,

(ii)allow the Indemnifying Party to dispute such action in the name of the
Indemnified Party and to conduct a defense to such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and

(iii)render to the Indemnifying Party all such assistance as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request in connection with such dispute and defense.

8.4.Purchase Price Adjustment. All amounts paid under this ARTICLE VIII
(including any payment received by Parent under the RandW Insurance Policy)
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, be treated as an adjustment to the
consideration being paid for the Company Common Stock.

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS

9.1.Taxes and Tax Refunds for Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

(a)The Stockholders shall severally (in accordance with each Stockholder's
Equity Ownership Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify the Parent
Indemnified Parties against, and be liable for any and all Losses (all herein
referred to as "Tax Losses") arising out of, resulting from or in any way
related to:

(i)any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period ("Pre-Closing Taxes"), including, for the avoidance of doubt, all
Transaction Payroll Taxes; provided, however, that such payments will be
required to be made only to the extent of the amount of the liability for Pre-
Closing Taxes which (A) is in excess of the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes
actually paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the
Closing Date and (B) has not already been reflected in the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital; or

(ii)any liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
applicability of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of
foreign, state or local Tax law for Taxes of any affiliated corporation (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) for Taxes incurred on or prior to the
Closing Date.

(b)Subject to the resolution of any Tax contest pursuant to Section 9.4, upon
notice (the "Tax Loss Notice") from Parent to the Representative that a Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to an indemnification payment for a Tax Loss
pursuant to Section 9.1(a), which Tax Loss Notice shall state with reasonable
specificity the nature of such Tax Loss, the date (if any) such item was paid
or properly accrued, and the computation of the amount of such Tax Loss, the
Representative shall, except to the extent that such Tax Loss, or the Stockholders' liability with respect
thereto, is disputed, pay to the Parent Indemnified Party on behalf of the
Stockholders the amount of such Tax Loss set forth in such Tax Loss Notice by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Representative Holdback
Account within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such Tax Loss Notice;
provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Loss exceeds the amount of
funds then remaining in the Representative Holdback Account (such amount, the
"Tax Loss Shortfall Amount"), then (i) the Representative shall pay to Parent
the amount then remaining in the Representative Holdback Account and (ii) the
Stockholders shall severally (in accordance with each Stockholder's Equity
Ownership Percentage), and not jointly, pay to Parent the Tax Loss Shortfall
Amount, each within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such Tax Loss Notice.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under Section 9.1(a) shall
survive the Closing until the end of the applicable statutes of limitations.
With respect to any indemnification obligation for any Tax for which a Taxing
Authority asserts a claim within ninety (90) days before the end of the
applicable statute of limitations, a Parent Indemnified Party shall be treated
as having provided timely notice to the Representative by providing written
notice to the Representative on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the
Parent Indemnified Party's receipt of a written assertion of the claim by the
Taxing Authority.

(d)The Stockholders shall be entitled to receive any refund of Taxes
(including refunds paid by credit against Taxes of Parent, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any
overpayment of estimated Pre-Closing Taxes by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, plus any interest on any such refund or credits received from
the applicable Taxing authority. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the Representative in obtaining any
refunds or credits which the Stockholders are entitled to receive under this
Section 9.1. Such cooperation shall include (i) informing the Representative
if and the extent that Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
becomes aware of the possible availability of any such refund or credit, (ii)
filing claims or amended Tax Returns at the request of the Representative to
obtain any such refund or credit and (iii) paying the amount of such credit or
refund over to the Representative (for further payment to the Stockholders,
subject to Section 11.1(c), in accordance with their respective Equity
Ownership Percentages and the payment instructions set forth in their
respective Letters of Transmittal) by wire transfer within five (5) Business
Days after the receipt thereof.

(e)If and to the extent it is determined at any time that any Tax deduction
that is intended to be taken by and for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries since the Acquisition Date in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date as set forth in Section 2.8 cannot be deducted in
such Pre-Closing Tax Period and must be deducted in a subsequent post-Closing
Tax period to reduce its income Tax liability for any Taxable period
commencing after the Closing Date, Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall take such applicable Tax deductions, in each case as and when permitted
under applicable Tax Law, and shall pay over to the Representative (for
further payment to the Stockholders, subject to Section 11.1(c), in accordance
with their respective Equity Ownership Percentages and the payment
instructions set forth in their respective Letters of Transmittal) the amount
of any Tax savings realized by Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries as a
result of such applicable Tax deductions. For the purposes of this Section
9.1(e), Tax savings will be deemed realized from the Tax deductions referred
to herein (x) upon the filing of an annual income Tax Return for a post-
Closing Tax period (including a short period income Tax Return) that shows a
reduced Tax liability as a result of such Tax deductions or (y) upon receipt
of a Tax refund payable as a result of such Tax deductions with respect to a
post-Closing Tax period. The calculation of the Tax savings realized from the
Tax deductions referred to in this Section 9.1(e) for a Taxable period or
portion thereof ending after the Closing Date shall be based on a "with and
without" calculation (i.e., the payment of the Tax savings will only be made
if the Tax deductions generated a reduced Tax liability or Tax refund,
assuming that it was the last deduction taken into consideration for the
applicable Taxable period). For each year with respect to which any Tax
deductions referred to in this Section 9.1(e) remain outstanding, Parent will
deliver to the Representative no later than five (5) Business Days after the
filing of the applicable Tax Returns for the prior Taxable period, a statement
in reasonable detail, together with any applicable supporting materials, of
the then outstanding Tax deductions and such "with and without" calculation
for such prior Taxable period. Without the Representative's prior written
consent, Parent shall not make, nor permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make, any carryback of any net operating losses or credits to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or make any other Tax elections that would reduce the
amount of any refunds of Taxes or credits against Taxes for the benefit of the
Stockholders as provided in this Section 9.1(e).

(f)Parent shall be responsible for and shall pay any Taxes attributable to the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to that
portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date as well as for
any Taxes attributable to the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date. Parent shall
be entitled to any refund of Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period to the
extent such refund is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date.

9.2.Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, in
order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the
Parties shall, to the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, treat
the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company and all of
its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes. In any case where applicable Law does
not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of the taxable year or period, the portion of any Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (for
example, property taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in
clause (i), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable
year or period ended on the Closing Date (such as taxes that are either based
on or related to income or receipts or imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property).

9.3.Tax Returns.

(a)Parent agrees that the Representative shall direct the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the preparation and filing, when due (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained), of all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The Stockholders
shall bear the expense for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(with such expenses being paid out of the Representative Holdback Account or,
if such expenses exceed the amount of funds then remaining in the
Representative Holdback Account, then the Stockholders shall severally (in
accordance with each Stockholder's Equity Ownership Percentage), and not
jointly, pay the amount of such excess expenses).

(b)Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns for any
Straddle Periods that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any Tax Return for a
Straddle Period shall be submitted to the Representative at least thirty (30)
calendar days prior to its due date (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) for the Representative's review and comment, which comments
shall be discussed by Parent with the Representative to determine in good
faith whether the Tax Returns for the Straddle Period should reflect the
Representative's comments.

(c)Any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns for Pre-Closing
Periods and for Straddle Periods which are prepared and filed pursuant to this
Section 9.3 shall be paid by the Representative on behalf of the Stockholders
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the due dates for such Tax Returns.

9.4.Tax Contests.

(a)If Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Representative receives notice
from any Governmental Entity of any proposed or actual audit, examination,
adjustment, claim, assessment or demand concerning the amount of Taxes of the
Company or any or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
such Party shall inform the other thereof within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such notice. No failure or delay in providing such notice shall
reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of any Party hereto,
except to the extent such failure or delay adversely affects the recipient
Party's ability to defend against any liability or claim with respect to such
Taxes. Any notice shall be accompanied by a copy of any written notice or
other document received from the applicable Governmental Entity with respect
to such matter.

(b)Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4, the Representative shall
have the sole right to control, at the expense of the Stockholders, the
contest of any audit, dispute or administrative, judicial or other proceeding
relating to the Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date so long as (i) the
Representative notifies Parent in writing within fifteen (15) days after
Parent (or Parent's Affiliate) has given notice of such claim that the
Stockholders will indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against
the entirety of any Tax Losses the Parent Indemnified Parties may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the claim, and (ii) the Representative conducts the defense of the claim
actively and diligently. If any of the conditions in the preceding sentence
are or become unsatisfied, (A) Parent may defend against, and, with the
consent of the Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to, the claim in any manner that it may deem appropriate, (B) the
Stockholders will reimburse Parent for the reasonable costs of defending
against the claim (including attorneys', accountants' and experts' fees and
disbursements) and (C) the Stockholders will remain responsible for any Tax
Losses the Parent Indemnified Parties may suffer to the fullest extent
provided in this Article IX. If the Representative elects to control any such
contest, Parent may, at its expense, participate in such contest. Parent shall
have the sole right to control, at its expense, the contest of any audit,
dispute or administrative, judicial or other proceeding relating to the Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period or for any
period commencing after the Closing Date. If Parent elects to control any such
contest relating to any Straddle Period, the Representative may, at its
expense, participate in such contest. No audit, dispute or administrative,
judicial or other proceeding may be settled (i) in the case of any such
contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period by the Representative without
Parent's prior written consent if such settlement would have an adverse impact
on Parent or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) in the case of any such contest relating to
a Straddle Period, by Parent without the Representative's prior written
consent if such settlement would have an adverse impact on any Stockholder;
provided, however, that no such consent by the Representative or Parent shall
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

9.5.Assistance and Cooperation. The Representative and Parent shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information (including access to books and records) and assistance
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for
the filing of any Tax Returns, for the preparation of any audit, for the
filing of Tax refund claims or amended Tax Returns and for the prosecution or
defense of any Tax claim. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep all books and records with respect to Taxes
and Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. Any information obtained under this
Section 9.5 shall be kept confidential except (i) as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding or (ii) with the consent of the
Party in possession of such information.

9.6.Transfer Taxes. Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the
other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half of (i) any and all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees payable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the costs of filing all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees.
Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to, and pay when due, all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by Law, the
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and documentation. The Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, shall pay to Parent the Taxes, fees and costs for which the
Stockholders are responsible under this Section 9.6 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Representative Holdback Account at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable due dates, provided, however,
that if the amount of such Taxes, fees and costs exceeds the amount of funds
then remaining in the Representative Holdback Account, then (x) the
Representative shall pay to Parent the amount then remaining in the
Representative Holdback Account and (ii) the Stockholders shall severally (in
accordance with each Stockholder's Equity Ownership Percentage), and not
jointly, pay to Parent the amount of such excess, each at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the applicable due date.

9.7.Treatment of Payments. All amounts paid under this ARTICLE IX shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, be treated for all purposes as an adjustment to
the consideration being paid for the Company Common Stock.

(a)By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by the
Stockholders, the acceptance of consideration under this Agreement and/or the
completion, execution and delivery of the Letters of Transmittal, each of the
Stockholders shall be deemed to have (i) designated Project Laser Holdings,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the representative of the
Stockholders (together with such Person's permitted successors, the
"Representative"), and (ii) appointed the Representative as the true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder to take any action (or
refrain from taking any action) on behalf of the Stockholders that is
contemplated to be taken by the Representative in that capacity by this
Agreement, including to (A) give and receive notices and communications to or
from Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Party)
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by the Stockholders individually); (B) authorize deliveries
(including by means of not objecting to claims) to Parent of funds from the
Representative Holdback Account; (C) determine and finalize the Final Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (D) object to any claims pursuant to

assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with

contemplated hereby or thereby; (G) amend this Agreement; and (H) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain
the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Person serving as the
Representative may be replaced at any time by the Stockholders who held a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. No bond shall be
required of the Representative, and the Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services.

(b)In complying with its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3(c) of this
Agreement, the Representative will examine each Letter of Transmittal and
Certificate and other supporting documents received to ascertain whether they
appear to have been completed and executed in all material respects in
accordance with the instructions set forth in such Letter of Transmittal. In
the event that the Representative determines that any Letter of Transmittal
does not appear to have been properly completed or executed in all material
respects, or, if applicable, that a Certificate does not appear to be in
proper form for surrender, or any other material irregularity in connection
with the surrender appears to exist, the Representative shall consult with
Parent for instructions and shall not waive such irregularity in connection

Certificate or other supporting document may indicate are owned by a
Stockholder is greater than (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that Section 3.3(a) of the Disclosure Letter indicates such Stockholder owned

the number of shares of Company Common Stock it is authorized to accept for
payment. In the absence of such instructions, the Representative is not
authorized to make payment and shall, except as thereafter directed in writing
by Parent, continue to hold any Certificates surrendered in connection
therewith, the related Letter of Transmittal, and any other supporting
documents received with such Certificates.

(c)The Representative shall not be liable to any Person for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Representative while acting in good faith and any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith. The Representative shall be reimbursed from the
Representative Holdback Account for any reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the performance of the
Representative's duties hereunder. The Representative shall also use the funds
held in the Representative Holdback Account to pay any amounts required to be
paid by or on behalf of the Company or the Stockholders, including amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.5(d), Section 8.2(a), Section 9.1(a), Section
9.1(b), Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.6, as well as amounts payable to Phantom
Plan Recipients pursuant to Section 2.7 (including the related Transaction
Payroll Taxes). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
the Representative reasonably believes that payments from the Representative
Holdback Account pursuant to this Section 11.1(c) may be made in the future,
then the Representative may withhold the estimated amount of such future
payments, or any reasonable reserve therefor, from any amounts otherwise
required to be distributed to the Stockholders under this Agreement.

to pursue the collection of the Indemnity Receivable on behalf of the Company
at the expense of the Stockholders and in any commercially reasonable manner
deemed appropriate by the Representative. Any amounts received by the

Representative, and any amounts received by the Company in respect of the
Indemnity Receivable shall be paid to the Representative by the Company within
five (5) Business Days of such receipt, in each case for further payment to
the Stockholders, subject to Section 11.1(c), in accordance with their
respective Equity Ownership Percentages and the payment instructions set forth
in their respective Letters of Transmittal. The Stockholders shall severally
(in accordance with each Stockholder's Equity Ownership Percentage), and not
jointly, indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties against, and be liable for
any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or in any way related to the
subject matter of this Section 11.1(d).

shall bear its own Transaction Expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.3.Public Announcements. No public release or announcement concerning the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party
without the prior written consent of Parent and the Company (for any such
release or announcement prior to the Effective Time) or the Representative
(for any such release or announcement after the Effective Time), which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable Governmental Entity to which the relevant Party is subject
(including the Securities and Exchange Commission), in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other Party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood
that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the
extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party.

achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

11.7.Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the U.S. or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity.

11.8.Successors and Assigns; Assignment; Parties in Interest. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns (if any). Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, no Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the
assignment of Parent's rights (but not obligations) to any lender. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person other than a Party any rights, interests, benefits or other remedies of
any nature under or by reason of this Agreement, except that the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement are intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties, and the provisions of Section 5.4 are intended to benefit
the Covered Persons, and all such intended third-party beneficiaries shall be
entitled to enforce such provisions of this Agreement.

11.9.Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties only by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by (i) Parent and the Company if
such instrument is executed prior to the Effective Time or (ii) Parent and the
Representative if such instrument is executed after the Effective Time. At any
time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other, may, to the extent legally allowed, (x) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other Parties, (y)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (z)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such Party contained herein. Any agreement by any Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if, and to the extent that, set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure on the part
of any Person to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Person in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of
any such power, right privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

11.10.Governing Law; Venue.

(a)This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all
respects by, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to conflicts of law or choice of law provisions thereof.

(b)Unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement, any action, claim,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any
provision of this Agreement shall be brought or otherwise commenced in any
state or federal court located in the State of Delaware. Each Party (i)
expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each
such court, and each appellate court located in the State of Delaware, in
connection with any such proceeding, (ii) agrees that each such court shall be
deemed to be a convenient forum and (iii) agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such proceeding commenced in any
such court, any claim that such Party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that such proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by
such court.

11.11.Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.11.

11.12.Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

11.13.Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature
page delivered by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall be binding
to the same extent as an original signature page. Any Party that delivers a
signature page by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall deliver an
original counterpart to any other Party that requests such original
counterpart, it being understood and agreed that the failure to deliver any
such original counterpart upon request shall not affect the binding nature of
the signature page delivered by facsimile or electronic image transmission.

[The remainder of this page has been intentionally left blank. Signature page
follows.] In WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed and delivered by its duly authorized representative as of the date
first written above.
