                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

          This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made
and entered into as of July 17, 2000, by and among DIGITAL ISLAND, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP., a California
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
SOFTAWARE, INC., a California corporation ("Company").

                                    RECITALS

          A.  The Board of Directors of Company has unanimously (i) determined
that it is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Company and its
shareholders that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub merge with and into Company, with Company being the
surviving corporation (the "Merger"), (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) determined to recommend
the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of Company.

          B.  The Board of Directors of Parent has (i) determined that the
Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests, of Parent and its
stockholders and, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

          C.  Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, no par value, of Company ("Company Common Stock"),  shall be
converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Common Stock, par value
$.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") at the rates set forth
herein.

          D.  The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that the Merger qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          E.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain
affiliates of Company have on the date hereof entered into Shareholder
Agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Shareholder
                                          ---------
Agreements") pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote the
shares of Company Common Stock over which such persons have voting power to
approve this Agreement and the Merger.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

                                   THE MERGER
                                   ----------

          1.1  The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2

Agreement of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Agreement of Merger") and
                                       ---------
the applicable provisions of the California Corporations Code ("California
Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving

          1.2  Closing; Effective Time. Unless this Agreement shall have been
               -----------------------

of the conditions set forth in Article VI or at such other time as the parties
hereto may agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the
offices of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, Two Embarcadero Place, 2200 Geng

the Merger Agreement being the "Effective Time").

          1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
               --------------------
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Agreement of Merger and the
applicable provisions of California Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and

          1.4  Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.
               ---------------------------------

               (a)  At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of

Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided by California Law and such Articles of Incorporation; provided,
                                                                  --------
however, that immediately after the Effective Time the Articles of
-------
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated so as
to read in its entirety like the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub with
Article I of the Articles of Incorporation amended to read as follows: "The name
of the corporation is SOFTAWARE, Inc."

               (b)  At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended; provided, however, that immediately
                                      --------  -------
after the Effective Time the Bylaws of

                                       2
<PAGE>

the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety so as
to read like the Bylaws of Merger Sub.

          1.5  Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, (a) the directors
               ----------------------
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or

the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

          1.6  Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
               -----------------------
Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto or the
holders of any of the following securities:

               (a)  Conversion of Company Capital Stock.  Subject to reduction
                    -----------------------------------
as a result of any Dissenting Shares (as defined below), the maximum number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued (including Parent Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of options ("Company Options") and warrants
("Company Warrants") to acquire shares of Company Common Stock assumed by
Parent) in exchange for the acquisition by Parent of all outstanding shares of
capital stock of Company ("Company Capital Stock"), all unexercised and
outstanding warrants to acquire Company Capital Stock and all unexpired,
unexercised or outstanding options, vested or unvested, to acquire Company
Capital Stock (collectively, "Company Securities") shall be (i) 9,375,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(f) below
(as so adjusted, the "Merger Shares"), and (ii) the additional number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in lieu of Merger Cash upon exercise following
the Effective Time of Company Options to be assumed pursuant to Section 5.10 of
this Agreement, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(f) below. The
maximum amount of cash to be paid in consideration for the acquisition by Parent
of the Company Securities shall be $20,000,000 (less (i) the amount of any
Excess Costs, as defined in Section 5.15 below and (ii) all applicable federal
and state income and employment taxes (including but not limited to FICA, FUTA,
Medicare, and state disability insurance) imposed in connection with the
issuance by the Company of all securities as set forth in Schedule 4.2 hereof),
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(f) below (as so adjusted, the
"Merger Cash" and together with the Merger Shares, the "Merger Consideration")
and subject to reduction as a result of any Dissenting Shares. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company
Capital Stock, each share of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares, if any, held by persons who shall have
perfected, and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited at or prior to the Effective
Time, dissenters' or appraisal rights in accordance with California Law
("Dissenting Shares")) shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive such number of Merger Shares and such portion of the Merger Cash as
shall be determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereof (the "Exchange Ratio");
                                       ---------
it being understood that the Company Options shall be taken into account in
calculating the portion of the Merger Cash Payable per share of Company Capital
Stock, even though no Merger Cash will be paid on the Company Options.

               (b)  Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by Parent,
                    ------------------------------------------------------
Merger Sub or Company. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital
---------------------
Stock that are owned by

                                       3
<PAGE>

Company as treasury stock, and each share of Company Capital Stock
(if any) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or of Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

          (c)  Company Stock Option Plan.  At the Effective Time, Company's
               -------------------------
Stock Option Plan, (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), and all Company Options
outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.10 and
thereafter constitute the right to purchase such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock determined in accordance with Section 5.10. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, no Merger Cash shall be payable with respect to the
Company Options so assumed.

          (d)  Unvested Company Common Stock.  If any shares of Company Common
               -----------------------------
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under the
Company Stock Option Plan, any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement,
or other agreement with Company or under which Company has any rights, then
(unless such condition terminates by virtue of the Merger pursuant to the
express terms of such agreement) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly bear any appropriate legends. In addition, the Merger Cash
consideration paid on those unvested shares in the Merger shall be held in
escrow by Parent (and invested in the same money market fund specified in the
Cash Escrow Agreement, pending distribution thereof) and shall be paid out
(together with any income thereon) as those shares subsequently vest in
accordance with the vesting schedule in effect for those shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Any cash held in escrow on unvested shares
repurchased by Parent pursuant to such repurchase options or otherwise forfeited
by the holders of those unvested shares shall revert to the Parent. The Company
shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

          (e)  Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  At the Effective Time, each share
               ---------------------------
of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

          (f)  Adjustments to Merger Shares.  The number of Merger Shares shall
               ----------------------------
be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time, so as to provide Parent and the


                                       4
<PAGE>

shareholders of the Company the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, like change or increase.

          (g)  Fractional Shares.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
               -----------------
will be issued hereunder, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied
by (ii) the average of the closing bid prices for a share of Parent Common Stock
as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty (20) trading days
immediately preceding (but not including) the last full trading day prior to
date on which the Effective Time occurs (the "Closing Market Value").

          (h)  Dissenters' Rights.  Any Dissenting Shares shall not be
               ------------------
converted into Merger Consideration or the right to receive Merger Consideration
but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
California Law. Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, or as required under California Law, it will not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such purchase demand.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares ("Dissenting Shareholder") who, pursuant to the
provisions of California law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for
shares of Company Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor from the Company
(but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
issue and deliver, upon surrender by such shareholder of certificate or
certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, the amount of Merger
Consideration to which such shareholder would otherwise be entitled under this
Section 1.6 less (i) the number of shares allocable to such shareholder that
have been deposited in the Stock Escrow Fund (as defined below) in respect of
such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7 and Article VIII
hereof and (ii) the amount of cash allocable to such shareholders that has been
deposited in the Cash Escrow Fund (as defined below) pursuant to Section 1.7 and
Article VIII hereof.

          1.7  Surrender of Certificates.
               -------------------------

               (a)  Exchange Agent.  Parent's transfer agent or another
                    --------------
institution selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company shall act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

               (b)  Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash.  As soon as
                    ---------------------------------------
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) days, after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, (i)
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and the cash payable, pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be deposited in a stock escrow fund (the "Stock Escrow Fund")
and the portion of the Merger Cash to be deposited into a cash escrow fund (the
"Cash Escrow Fund" and, together with the

                                       5
<PAGE>

Stock Escrow Fund, the "Escrow Funds") pursuant to the requirements of Article
VIII, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(g).

               (c)  Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time,
                    -------------------
Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Capital Stock, whose shares were converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash consideration to which such holder is entitled (and cash
in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and payment of
cash consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6, less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash to be
deposited in the Escrow Funds on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article VIII
hereof, and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Parent shall cooperate in good faith in making available
the letter of transmittal and related instructions on a timely basis so that the
holders can effect such surrender at the Closing. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock, and the right to
receive the cash consideration in accordance with Section 1.6, into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted and the right to
receive an amount of cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof,
Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article
VIII hereof) a certificate or certificates representing fifteen percent (15%) of
the sum of the Merger Shares which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow
Agent as nominee for the holders of Certificates cancelled pursuant to this
Section 1.7, together with fifteen percent (15%) of the Merger Cash, both to be
held in the respective Escrow Funds in accordance with Article VIII. Such shares
and cash shall be beneficially owned by such holders and shall be held in escrow
and shall be available to compensate Parent for certain damages as provided in
Article VIII hereof. During the period in which the Merger Shares are retained
in the Stock Escrow Fund (i) the Company's shareholders shall be entitled to
vote such Merger Shares and receive any dividends paid thereon, and (ii) Parent
will show Merger Shares in the Stock Escrow Fund as outstanding on its balance
sheet. To the extent not used for such purposes, such shares and cash shall be
released, all as provided in Article VIII hereof.


                                       6
<PAGE>

               (d)  Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No
                    ------------------------------------------------
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

               (e)  Transfers of Ownership.  If any certificate for shares of
                    ----------------------
Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

               (f)  No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
                    ------------
this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any
party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

               (g)  Dissenting Shares.  The provisions of this Section 1.7
                    -----------------
shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except
that the obligations of Parent under this Section 1.7 shall commence on the date
of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for such shares the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
and amount of Merger Cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.6 hereof.

          1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares
               ----------------------------------------------------
of Parent Common Stock issued, and cash consideration paid, upon the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to
have been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

          1.9  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
               --------------------------------------
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
                                  --------  -------

                                       7
<PAGE>

discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

          1.10  Withholding. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
                -----------
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

          1.11  Exemption from Registration.
                ---------------------------

                (a)  The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by reason of Section
3(a)(10) thereof or, to the extent Section 1.11(b) is applicable, pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and SEC rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Subject to the provisions hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger will be qualified under the California Corporations
Code, pursuant to Section 25121 thereof, after a fairness hearing has been held
pursuant to the authority granted by Section 25142 of such law, and (if deemed
necessary by Parent in its good faith judgment) such fairness hearing shall also
address the assumption by Parent of all Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement. Parent and Company shall each use all requisite commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to file, as promptly as practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement an application for issuance of a permit
pursuant to Section 25121 of the California Corporations Code to issue such
securities (and, if deemed necessary by Parent in its good faith judgment, to
assume such Company Options) (the "California Permit") and (ii) to obtain the
California Permit as promptly as practicable.

                (b)  In the event that the California Permit cannot be obtained
on or before September 15, 2000, or without the imposition of burdensome
conditions, then Parent and Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
and SEC rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, on terms and conditions
that are reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Company. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in the event of such a private placement: (i) as a
condition to effecting such issuance as a private placement pursuant to Section
4(2) of the Securities Act, Parent shall be entitled to obtain from each
shareholder of Company a Shareholder Representation Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (or such other form as shall be reasonably
                   ---------
satisfactory to Parent and Company) and that Parent will be relying upon the
representations made by each shareholder of Company in the applicable
Shareholder Representation Agreement in connection with the

                                       8
<PAGE>

issuance of Parent Common Stock to such shareholder, (ii) until registered on
Form S-3 as provided below, the shares of Parent Common Stock so issued pursuant
to Section 1.6 will not be registered under the Securities Act and will
constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of the Securities Act, and
(iii) the certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock shall bear
appropriate legends to identify such privately placed shares as being restricted
under the Securities Act, to comply with applicable state securities laws and,
if applicable, to notice the restrictions on transfer of such shares.

                (c)  In the event of a private placement as described in
Section 1.11(b) above, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as practicable (and in any event within
30 days) after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-3 covering
the resale of such shares of Parent Common Stock issued prior thereto in
connection with the Merger and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such registration statement to become effective as promptly as
practicable after filing and to keep such registration statement effective until
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time or such earlier date on which the
shares covered thereby are sold or transferred by the original holders thereof.
Parent's obligation in the preceding sentence to file the registration statement
within thirty (30) days is subject to the condition that the holders of Company
Capital Stock provide Parent promptly, but in no event more than fifteen (15)
days after the Closing, all information relating to them for inclusion in the
registration statement. While the foregoing registration statement is effective,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the holders of shares covered
by any such registration statement shall only resell securities pursuant to such
registration statement subject to (i) Blackout Period Restrictions (as defined
below) and (ii) in the case of holders who are officers, employees or
consultants of Parent, Company or any of their affiliates, any trading window
restrictions applicable to similarly situated Parent officers, employees or
consultants. "Blackout Period Restrictions" shall mean the restrictions on sale
of registered shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the registration
statement permitted to be imposed by Parent as follows: in the event that, at
any time while the registration statement remains effective, Parent determines
in its reasonable judgment and in good faith that the sale of securities
pursuant to such registration statement would require disclosure of material
information that Parent has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as
confidential, upon giving written notice to the selling securityholders of such
good faith determination, Parent shall be entitled to suspend sales of the
registered securities pursuant to the registration statement for a period
beginning on the date of receipt of such notice and expiring on the earlier of
(i) the date upon which such material information is disclosed to the public or
ceases to be material or (ii) ninety (90) days after the receipt of such notice
from Parent; provided, however, that Parent shall not be permitted to impose
             --------  -------
such restrictions provided herein on more than two (2) occasions.

          1.12  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time
                ------------------------------------------
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company, the officers and directors of

                                       9
<PAGE>

Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is
not inconsistent with this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY
                   -----------------------------------------

          Except as disclosed in that section of the document of even date
herewith delivered by Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section
of this Agreement to which any of the representations and warranties
specifically relate or as disclosed in another section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule if it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure that it is
applicable to another Section of this Agreement, Company hereby represents and
warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

          2.1  Organization, Standing and Power. Company is a corporation duly
               --------------------------------
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of California.
Company has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Company. Company has made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of the Articles of Incorporation or other
charter or organizational documents, as amended, of Company. Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or
other charter or organizational documents, each as amended. Company does not,
directly or indirectly, own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity.

          2.2  Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Company
               -----------------
consists solely of 309,566,242 shares of Company Common Stock, no par value, of
which 20,492,945 shares are issued and outstanding, and 4,593,023 shares of
Preferred Stock, no par value, all of which shares have been designated Series A
Preferred Stock, and all of which are issued and outstanding. There are no other
outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities and no outstanding
commitments to issue any shares of capital stock or voting securities, other
than pursuant to the exercise of Company Options outstanding under the Company
Stock Option Plan. Schedule 2.2 sets forth a true and complete list (including
                   ------------
numbers of shares and/or rights) of holders of Company's capital stock and
voting securities, and any persons with rights to acquire Company's capital
stock and voting securities, which list will be promptly updated prior to
Closing to reflect any changes thereto (which changes are in any event subject
to the restrictions imposed under Section 4.2 below). All outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are free and clear of any liens or encumbrances other than any
liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders thereof, and are
not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first refusal created by statute,
the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, each as amended, of Company or any
agreement to which Company is a party or by which it is bound. Company has
reserved 6,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the
Company Stock Option Plan, of which

                                      10
<PAGE>

750,678 shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises and 2,153 shares
are subject to outstanding, unexercised options (none of which such shares are
vested). Except for (i) the rights created pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the
outstanding options under the Company Stock Option Plan, and (iii) Company's
right to repurchase any unvested shares under the Company Stock Option Plan,
there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements
of any character to which Company is a party or by which it is bound obligating
Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of capital stock or voting
securities of Company or obligating Company to grant, extend, accelerate the
vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. Except for this
Agreement, there are no contracts, commitments or agreements relating to voting,
purchase or sale of Company's capital stock or voting securities (i) between or
among Company and any of its securityholders or (ii) to Company's knowledge,
between or among any of Company's securityholders. None of the options
previously granted by Company permit any accelerated vesting or exercisability
of those options or the shares of Company Common Stock subject to those options
by reason of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 6.3 hereto), and the terms of the
                                  ------------
Company Stock Option Plan and the outstanding option agreements thereunder each
permit the Parent's assumption of those options as options to purchase Parent
Common Stock as provided in Section 5.10 of this Agreement (including the
substitution of additional shares of Parent Common Stock for the Merger Cash),
without the consent or approval of the holders of those options, Company's
shareholders, or otherwise, and without any accelerated vesting of the options
or the underlying option shares. True and complete copies of all agreements and
instruments relating to or issued under the Company Stock Option Plan have been
provided to Parent and such agreements and instruments have not been amended,
modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements to amend, modify or
supplement such agreements or instruments in any case from the form provided to
Parent. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and all Company Options
and warrants to acquire Company Capital Stock from Company were issued in
compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws. Schedule 2.2
                                                                  ------------

Company, including the name of the holder, the date of issuance, and the
principal amount and interest rate of each such debt, as well as the aggregate
amount owed to the holder of each such instrument as of May 31, 2000 (including
accrued and unpaid interest, and any premiums).

          2.3  Authority. Company has all requisite corporate power and
               ---------
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other agreements attached as
exhibits hereto (the "Ancillary Agreements") to which Company is a party, to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Company is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company, subject
only to the approval of the Merger by Company's shareholders as contemplated by
Section 6.1(a). Each of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
Company is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Company and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Company enforceable against
Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
(i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally, or (ii) the availability


                                      11
<PAGE>

of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law. The execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement by Company does not, and the performance of Company's
obligations hereunder or thereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit, or result in any other consequence, under
(i) any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or other charter or
organizational documents, each as amended, of Company or (ii) any mortgage,
indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Company or any of its respective properties or assets,
except in the case of clause (ii) for any conflicts, violations, defaults or
other occurrences that would not (A) individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company or (B) prevent or materially impair or delay
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or commission, self-regulatory organization or other
governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity") is required by
or with respect to Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the performance of Company's obligations hereunder or thereunder or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for
(i) the filing of the Agreement of Merger, as provided in Section 1.2, (ii) such
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable federal or state securities laws or
the securities laws of any foreign country, and (iii) such filings as may be
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), and (iv) such other consents, authorizations, filings,
approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company and would not prevent or materially alter or
delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

          2.4  Financial Statements. Company has delivered to Parent the
               --------------------
audited financial statements (including, without limitation, balance sheets,
statements of operations and statements of cash flows) of Company for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, and the unaudited financial
statements (including, without limitation, balance sheet, statement of
operations and statement of cash flows) of Company as at, and for the five-month
period ended May 31, 2000 (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements").
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except that the financial statements
which are not audited do not have notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated and with each other. The Company Financial
Statements fairly present the financial condition and operating results of
Company as of the dates, and for the periods, indicated therein, subject to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments. Company maintains and will
continue to maintain until the Closing an adequate system of internal financial
and accounting controls for Company. There has been no change in Company's

communications relating thereto that have been distributed by Company to its
employees) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject
to ERISA reporting requirements, made available upon Parent's request copies of
the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any Company Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either

adopting employer. Company has made available upon Parent's request the most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued with

registration statements and prospectuses prepared in connection with each
Company Employee Plan.

knowledge of Company, there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to
any Company Employee Plan, which could reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company and for which there is no
applicable exemption; (iii) each Company Employee Plan has been administered in
material accordance with its terms and in material compliance with the

performed all obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any
material respect in default under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any
material default or violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee
Plans; (iv) neither Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is subject to any
liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of
ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans; (v) all material

<PAGE>

current plan years; (vi) with respect to each Company Employee Plan, no
"reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any
such event for which the notice requirement has been waived) nor any event
described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has occurred; (vii) no Company
Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred or expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code; and (viii) each Company Employee Plan can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with
its terms. With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either
an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental
reports (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and has properly and
timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees
required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company
Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation
has been brought or, to the knowledge of Company, is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the
Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made or provided by Company to any Employee will be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

                (d)  With respect to each Company Employee Plan, Company has

failure to comply would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company.

Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee or other service provider of Company or any other ERISA Affiliate to
severance benefits or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount, of compensation due any such employee or
service provider.

                (f)  There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by Company or any other ERISA Affiliate
relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee
Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above
the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent
fiscal year included in Company's financial statements.

                (g)  Company does not currently maintain, sponsor, participate
in or contribute to, nor has it ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

or policy or for long term disability. There are no controversies pending or, to

     5.10  Employee Benefit Plans.
           ----------------------

           (a)  Assumption of Options.  At the Effective Time, the Company Stock
                ---------------------
Option Plan, and each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under the Company Stock Option Plan, whether vested or unvested, will be
assumed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Merger Cash
shall be paid with respect to the options so assumed. Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent that Schedule 5.10 hereto sets forth a true and complete
                            -------------
list as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding options under the
Company Stock Option Plan, including the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the
exercise price per share and the term of each such option. On the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an
updated Schedule 5.10, current as of the Closing Date. Each such option so
        -------------
assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject
to,

                                       35
<PAGE>

the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan and the
applicable stock option agreement as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that:

                       (i)   the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
for which the option will be exercisable immediately after the assumption shall
be equal to the sum of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the per
share exchange ratio in effect for the conversion of one share of Company Common
Stock into a fractional share of Parent Common Stock in the Merger plus (B) the
additional number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing (x)
the total amount of Merger Cash which would have otherwise been payable at the
Effective Time for the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
option immediately prior to the Effective Time had those shares been actually
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time by (y) the Closing Market Value,
with the resulting number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
assumed option to be rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, and

                       (ii)  the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed option will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the total exercise price payable for the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
option immediately after the assumption (as determined pursuant to subparagraph
(i) immediately above), with such adjusted per share exercise price to be
rounded up to the next whole cent.

          Consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the
documents governing the outstanding options under such Plan, the Merger will not
terminate any of the outstanding options under the Company Stock Option Plan or
accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options or the shares of Parent
Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon the Parent's assumption
of the options in the Merger.  It is the intention of the parties that the
options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent permissible,
following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section
422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will issue to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time
was a holder of an outstanding option under the Company Stock Option Plan, a
document in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholders'
Agent (as defined below) evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Parent.

          (b)  Assignment of Repurchase Options. All outstanding rights of
               --------------------------------
Company which it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase
unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the "Repurchase Options") shall be
assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent
upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and
the purchase price per share shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
Upon the exercise of the Repurchase Options for any unvested shares, the Merger
Cash held in escrow on those repurchased shares shall revert to the Parent.

                                       36
<PAGE>

          (c)  Employee Service Credit.  Company employees who become employed
               -----------------------
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon or immediately following the Closing
shall be given full credit for their Company service under Parent employee
benefit plans for purposes of seniority, eligibility and vesting to the extent
allowable by law and the applicable plan documents. Parent agrees that for
purposes of accrual of vacation, PTO benefits or other such benefits, Parent
will use the effective date of Company's employees' respective employment with
Company. Such Company employees shall, to the extent then otherwise eligible, be
allowed to participate in Parent's employee stock purchase plan on the first
entry date under such plan following the Closing.

          (d)  Plan Termination.  Unless Parent consents otherwise in writing,
               ----------------
Company shall take all action necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, at
or before the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan or
other defined contribution retirement plan or employee stock purchase plan.

Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding options under the Company
Stock Option Plan assumed by Parent. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause all holders of assumed Company Options to agree in writing not to exercise
their options pursuant to Section 1.6 until Parent has filed a registration
statement on Form S-8 in accordance with this Section. Company shall cooperate
with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

     5.12  Listing of Additional Shares.  As soon as practicable (and in any
           ----------------------------
event not more than five (5) days) after the Closing, to the extent required
under Nasdaq rules, Parent shall file with the Nasdaq National Market a
Notification Form for Listing of Additional Shares with respect to the shares of
Parent Capital Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Capital Stock in
the Merger and upon exercise of options and warrants to acquire Company's
Capital Stock assumed by Parent as a result of the Merger.

     5.13  Employees.  Set forth on Schedule 5.13 is a list of employees of
           ---------                -------------
Company to whom Parent will make an offer of employment pursuant to a an
Employment and Non-Competition Agreement, substantially in the forms of Exhibit

than up to the $6,000,000 of fees and expenses payable to Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., in accordance with Company's agreement with such
firm, a true and complete copy of which has been furnished to Parent), legal
counsel and accountants, in excess of $1,000,000 ("Excess Costs") shall be the
obligation of Company's shareholders; further provided that the foregoing
                                      ------- --------
$6,000,000 or $1,000,000 expense thresholds shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar
by any and all amounts paid or payable by Company to or for the account of
Providence Equity Partners or Josh Steinberg, it being understood that such
reductions shall be applied to the $6,000,000 or $1,000,000 expense threshold in
whatever combination will result in the lowest total Excess Costs based on the
relative amounts of fees and expenses.  Any Excess Costs shall offset the Merger
Consideration as provided above.  If Parent or Company receives any invoices for
Excess Costs, Parent or Company, with Parent's written approval, may pay such
fees; provided, however, that such payment shall, if not promptly reimbursed by
      --------  -------
Company's shareholders at Parent's request, be deductible from the Merger
Consideration or constitute "Damages" recoverable under the Escrow Agreements.

           ------------------------------------
cause or allow the Surviving Corporation to modify, and to cause the Surviving

its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as currently in effect.

     (b)  For a period of three (3) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a directors' and

covered by Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (true

Parent) with coverage in the amount and scope at least as favorable as Company's
existing coverage; provided that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
in the aggregate in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
Company for such coverage; and if such premium would at any time exceed 200% of
such amount, then Parent shall maintain insurance policies which provide the
maximum and best coverage available at an annual premium equal to 200% of such
amount.

     5.17  Preferred Stock; Warrants.  Company shall (i) ensure that either all
           -------------------------

Common Stock in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation of Company or that
the Articles of Incorporation of Company shall provide that the Merger shall
cause a liquidation event with respect to the Company Preferred Stock, so that
shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration in the Merger, and (ii) ensure that all outstanding Company
Warrants have been exercised at or prior to the Effective Time.

     5.18  Stock Option Waivers.   Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
           --------------------

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                           ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION
                           --------------------------

          8.1  Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
               -----------
fifteen percent (15%) of the Merger Shares (the "Escrow Shares") shall be
registered in the name of, and be deposited with, State Street Bank and Trust
Company of California, N.A. (or another institution selected by Parent with the
reasonable consent of Company) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such
deposit (together with interest and other income thereon) to constitute the
Stock Escrow Fund and fifteen percent (15%) of the Merger Cash (together with
interest and other income thereon) (the "Escrow Cash") to constitute the Cash
Escrow Fund and to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow
Agreements attached hereto as Exhibit E-1 and Exhibit E-2. The Escrow Funds
                              -----------     -----------
shall be available to compensate Parent pursuant to the indemnification
obligations of the shareholders of Company.

          8.2  Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
               ---------------
Article VIII, the shareholders of Company will indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its officers, directors, agents and employees, and each person, if
any, who controls or may control Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act
(hereinafter referred to individually as an "Indemnified Person" and
collectively as "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all losses,
costs, damages, liabilities (including without limit, GAAP liabilities) and
expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of action, including,
without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any recoveries by Parent under
existing insurance policies or indemnities from third parties (collectively,
"Damages") arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of or default in any
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by
Company in or pursuant to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules or
any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement, including any agreement entered into
by Parent and Company in connection with this Agreement and any certificates
delivered pursuant to Article VI hereof, except for the certificate delivered to
Latham & Watkins pursuant to Section 6.2(c) hereof. The Escrow Funds shall be
security and the exclusive remedy for this indemnity obligation subject to the
limitations in this Agreement. Parent and Company each acknowledge that such
Damages, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the
Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective Time would have led to a
reduction in the total number of shares Parent would have agreed to issue in
connection with the Merger. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability

                                       46
<PAGE>

(i) of Company for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the
Merger is not consummated, or (ii) of any Company shareholder in connection with
any breach by such shareholder of the Shareholder Representation Agreement or
Irrevocable Proxy. No claim for indemnification after the Effective Time shall
be made under this Article VIII unless and until aggregate Damages (including
Damages pursuant to all prior claims) exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000),
in which event the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for
all Damages, including amounts below such threshold amount; provided, however,
                                                            --------  -------
that the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for all
Damages arising from any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties made
in Section 2.2 (if such inaccuracy involves the existence of any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Company Capital Stock that are not disclosed
therein), irrespective of the foregoing threshold amount; and provided further,
                                                              -------- -------
that in no event shall the Indemnified Persons be entitled to indemnification
for any Damages in excess of the property in the Escrow Funds (except to the
extent that such indemnification is for the foregoing inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made in Section 2.2, which shall be indemnified
without limit hereunder. Absent fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct, the
provisions set forth in this Section 8.2 shall be the sole remedy of the
Indemnified Persons for any breach of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement.

          8.3  Escrow Period. The Escrow Period shall terminate upon the
               -------------
expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
that a portion of the Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares, which is necessary to
satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's Certificate
theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the Escrow
Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to expiration of
the Escrow Period, shall remain in the Escrow Funds until such claims have been
resolved. Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the
Effective Time.

          8.4  Claims upon Escrow Funds. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or
               ------------------------
before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer
of Parent (an "Officer's Certificate"), setting forth the estimate of Damages
and specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, or properly
accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
claim to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.5 and 8.6 below, deliver to Parent out of the Cash
Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, the Escrow Cash held in the Cash Escrow
Fund having a value equal to such Damages. In the event the Damages exceed the
aggregate amount of assets held in the Cash Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to Parent out of the Stock Escrow Fund, shares of Parent Common Stock or
other assets held in the Stock Escrow Fund having a value equal to such Damages
not previously covered by the Cash Escrow Fund. For the purpose of compensating
Parent for its Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent Common Stock in
the Stock Escrow Fund shall be valued at $32 per share of Parent Common Stock
(the "Escrow Value").

          8.5  Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
               --------------------
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate
shall be delivered to the Shareholders' Agent (defined in Section 8.7 below) and
for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery to the Shareholders' Agent
of such Officer's Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of Parent
Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof unless the

                                       47
<PAGE>

Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholders'
Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of the Parent Common Stock or other
property in the Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 8.4 hereof, provided
that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholders' Agent shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent
prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.

          8.6  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.
               ------------------------------------

               (a)  In case the Shareholders' Agent shall so object in writing
to any claim or claims by Parent made in any Officer's Certificate, Parent shall
have ten (10) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of an objection by the
Shareholders' Agent to respond in a written statement to the objection of the
Shareholders' Agent. If after such ten (10) day period there remains a dispute
as to any claims, the Shareholders' Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith
for ten (10) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholders' Agent and Parent should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by
both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Parent
Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Funds in accordance with the
terms thereof.

               (b)  If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Parent or the Shareholders' Agent may, by written notice to
the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or
loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator. The decision of the
arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement,
and notwithstanding anything in Section 8.5 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments
out of the Escrow Funds in accordance therewith.

               (c)  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Santa Clara, San Mateo or San Francisco County, California under the commercial
rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of
this Section 8.6(c), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the
amount thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be
deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party unless the arbitrators award Parent more
than one-half (1/2) of the amount in dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute;
otherwise, the Company shareholders for whom shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise issuable to them have been deposited in the Escrow Funds shall be
deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses,
including without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs, reasonably incurred by
the other party to the arbitration.

          8.7  Shareholders' Agent.

                                       48
<PAGE>

               (a)  Mark Cronan shall be constituted and appointed as agent
("Shareholders' Agent") for and on behalf of the Company shareholders to give
and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of the
Parent Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to
take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders'
Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not
less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be
required of the Shareholders' Agent, and the Shareholders' Agent shall receive
no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
shareholders.

               (b)  The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder as Shareholders' Agent while acting in good faith, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Company shareholders shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Shareholders Agent and hold him harmless against any
loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Shareholders' Agent and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.

               (c)  The Shareholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to
information about Company and the reasonable assistance of Company's officers
and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder, provided that the Shareholders' Agent shall treat confidentially and
not disclose any nonpublic information from or about Company to anyone (except
on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information
confidentially).

          8.8  Actions of the Shareholders' Agent. A decision, act, consent or
               ----------------------------------
instruction of the Shareholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Company shareholders for whom shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable
to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Company shareholder, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders'
Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Company shareholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent.

          8.9  Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-
               ------------------
party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow
Fund, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders' Agent of such claim, and
the Shareholders' Agent and the Company shareholders for whom shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund shall
be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim.
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim;
provided, however, that Parent may not effect the settlement of any such claim
without the written consent of the Shareholders' Agent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. If the amount of

                                       49
<PAGE>

any such claim exceeds the amounts then on deposit in the Escrow Fund, the
Company shareholders (acting through the Shareholders' Agent) shall be entitled
to assume the defense of such claim; provided, however, that they shall not, in
whole or in part, settle such claim without the prior written consent of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that the
Shareholders' Agent has consented to any such settlement, the Shareholders'
Agent shall have no power or authority to object under Section 8.6 or any other
provision of this Article VIII to the amount of any claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

                                  ARTICLE IX

               -----------
Adverse Effect" means, with respect to any person or entity, any event, change

          The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

          1. Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, and Company shall
be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

          2. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective

          3. At the Effective Time (i) all shares of Company Capital Stock that
are owned directly or indirectly by Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other
subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled, and no securities of Parent or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, (ii) each of the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (other than shares, if any, held
by persons who have not voted such shares for approval of the Merger and with
respect to which such persons shall become entitled to exercise dissenters'
rights in accordance with Section 1300 et seq. of the California Corporations
Code, referred to hereinafter as "Dissenting Shares") shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive ________ of a share of Parent Common
Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and $_______ in cash.
Those shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as provided in this Section 3
are referred to herein as the "Parent Shares."

          4. Any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into Parent Common
Stock but shall be converted into the right to receive from the Company such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the law of the State of California. If after the Effective
Time any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then as
of the occurrence of the event which causes the loss of such status, such shares
shall be converted into Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.

          5. Notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, no fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise, but for rounding as
provided herein, be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock shall receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to the per share market
value of Parent Common Stock (deemed to be $32) multiplied by the fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder shall be aggregated,
so that no Company shareholder shall receive cash in an amount greater than the
value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

          6. The conversion of Company Capital Stock into Parent Common Stock as
provided by this Merger Agreement shall occur automatically at the Effective
Time without action by the holders thereof. Each holder of Company Capital Stock
shall thereupon be entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization.

          7. Also, at the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into and exchanged for one share of Common Stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

          8. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and Company shall succeed, without other transfer, to all of the rights
and properties of Merger Sub and shall be subject to all the debts and
liabilities thereof in the same manner as if Company

property of each corporation shall be preserved unimpaired.

         9.  At the Effective Time, Company's Stock Option Plan, as amended (the
"Company Stock Option Plan"), and all options to purchase Company Common Stock
then outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plan shall be assumed by Parent.

        10.  At the Effective Time, each warrant to acquire shares of Company's
Capital Stock then outstanding (each a "Company Warrant") shall be converted and
exchanged for warrants to purchase such number of shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization.

        11.  This Merger Agreement is intended as a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

        12.  (a) The Articles of Incorporation of Company in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation unless and until thereafter amended, provided however,
that immediately after the Effective Time the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated so as to read in its
entirety like the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub with Article 1 of the
Articles of Incorporation amended to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation is SoftAware, Inc."

             (b) The Bylaws of Company in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation unless and until
amended or repealed as provided by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

        13.  (a) Notwithstanding the approval of this Merger Agreement by the
shareholders of Company, this Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time by mutual agreement of the Boards of Directors of
Parent and Company.

             (b) Notwithstanding the approval of this Merger Agreement by the
shareholders of Company, this Merger Agreement shall terminate in the event that
the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization shall be terminated as therein
provided.

             (c) In the event of the termination of this Merger Agreement as

             (d) This Merger Agreement may be signed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one agreement.

             (e) This Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto any
time before or after approval hereof by the shareholders of Company, but, after
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires the further
approval of such shareholders without obtaining such approval. This Merger
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties hereto.

                                 EXCHANGE RATIO

     Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings set forth in the Agreement.

liquidation preferences set forth in Section 2 of the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation of Company.  The total number of Merger Shares and
amount of Merger Cash to be exchanged for Company Preferred Stock is referred to
herein as the "Preferred Component."  The "Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio" shall
be determined by dividing the stock portion of the Preferred Component by the
number of shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time.  The "Preferred Cash Exchange Ratio" shall be determined by
dividing the cash portion of the Preferred Component by the number of shares of
Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.  In
the event that shares of different series of Company Preferred Stock remain
outstanding prior to the Effective Time, there will be separate exchange ratios
for each such series.

          (ii) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock (after
giving effect to the conversion, exchange or exercise, as the case may be, of
all securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Company
Common Stock (other than Company Preferred Stock), including all unexpired
outstanding options, warrants or other rights which are so converted, exercised
or exchanged at or prior to the Effective Time) issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted and
exchanged for the right to receive (a) such number of Merger Shares as shall be
determined by subtracting the number of shares comprising the stock portion of
the Preferred Component from the Merger Shares and dividing the result by the
sum of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares cancelled in accordance with
Section 1.6(b)), (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
all outstanding Company Options, and (iii) the number of Shares of Company
Common Stock underlying any Company Securities other than Company Options and
Company Preferred Stock (the "Fully Diluted Common Stock") and (b) an amount of
Merger Cash as shall be determined by subtracting the cash portion of the
Preferred Component from the Merger Cash and dividing the result by the Fully
Diluted Common Stock.  The "Common Stock Exchange Ratio" shall be determined by
subtracting the stock portion of the Preferred Component from the Merger Shares
and dividing the result by the Fully Diluted Common Stock.  The "Common Cash
Exchange Ratio" shall be determined by subtracting the cash portion of the
Preferred Component from the Merger Cash and dividing the result by the Fully
Diluted Common Stock.

          (iii)  At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted and exchanged for an
option to purchase such number of shares of Parent Common Stock and on such
terms as set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Agreement.

action or transaction would or could reasonably be expected to prevent or

terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted
Shares.

    2.  Agreement to Vote Shares. Prior to the Expiration, Shareholder covenants
        ------------------------
and agrees as follows:

                   (a)  At each meeting of the shareholders of Company called to
vote upon the Merger, the Reorganization Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, or at any adjournment thereof, or
in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval
(including by written consent) with respect to the Merger, the Reorganization
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization
Agreement, is sought, such Shareholder shall, including by executing a
shareholder's written consent if requested by Parent, vote (or cause to be
voted) such Shareholder's Shares or New Shares in favor of the adoption and
approval by Company of the Reorganization Agreement and the approval of the
terms thereof and of the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated
by the Reorganization Agreement and in favor of any matter that could reasonably
be expected to facilitate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Reorganization Agreement, including any agreements or arrangements that may
result in the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                   (b)  At any meeting of the shareholders of Company or at any
adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which such Shareholder's
vote, consent or other approval is sought, such Shareholder shall vote (or cause
to be voted) the Shares or New Shares of such Shareholder against, and shall not
consent to (and shall cause not to be consented to), any Alternative Transaction
or Frustrating Transaction.

                   (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit or restrict Shareholder from acting in his capacity as a director or
employee of Company, to the extent applicable, it being understood that this
Agreement shall apply to Shareholder solely in his capacity as a shareholder of
Company.

    3. Irrevocable Proxy. Shareholder hereby agrees to timely deliver to Parent
       -----------------
a duly executed proxy in the form attached hereto as Annex A (the "Proxy"), such
                                                     -------
Proxy to cover the Shares and New Shares in respect of which Shareholder is
entitled to vote at each meeting of the Shareholders of Company (including,
without limitation, each written consent in lieu of a meeting). Upon the
execution of this Agreement by Shareholder, Shareholder hereby revokes any and
all prior proxies given by Shareholder with respect to the Shares and agrees not
to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the Shares until after the
Expiration.

    4. Additional Covenants of Shareholder. Shareholder hereby represents,
       -----------------------------------
warrants and covenants to Parent as follows:

                   (a)  Shareholder has full power and legal capacity to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance
with its terms. Except as may be limited by (i) the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other laws affecting or
relating to the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) the availability of
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not,
and the performance of Shareholder's obligations hereunder will not, result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right to
terminate, amend, accelerate or cancel any right or obligation under, or result
in the creation of any lien or encumbrance on any Shares or New Shares pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Shareholder is a
party or by which Shareholder or the Shares or New Shares are or will be bound
or affected.

                   (b)  Shareholder shall take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all other things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement.

accountant or other agent retained by Shareholder or them to, issue any press
release or make any other public statement with respect to the Reorganization
Agreement, this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement or this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent, except as may be required by applicable law.

                   (d)  Until the Expiration, Shareholder will not (and will use
Shareholder's reasonable best efforts to cause Company, its affiliates,
officers, directors and employees and any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by Shareholder or them, not to): (i) initiate
or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan, or offer to acquire all
or any substantial part of the business or assets or capital stock of Company,
whether by merger or other business combination, purchase of stock or assets,
tender offer or otherwise, or to liquidate Company or otherwise distribute to
the Shareholders of Company all or any substantial part of the business, assets
or capital stock of Company (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) initiate,
directly or indirectly, any contact with any person in an effort to or with a
view towards soliciting or encouraging or facilitating any Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) furnish information concerning Company's business, properties or assets to
any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than
Parent, or any associate, agent or representative of Parent) under any
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to relate to an actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) negotiate or enter into discussions or
an agreement, directly or indirectly, with any entity or group with respect to
any potential Acquisition Proposal. In the event Shareholder shall receive or
become aware of any Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date hereof,
Shareholder shall promptly inform Parent as to any such matter and the details
thereof to the extent possible without breaching any other agreement to which
such Shareholder is a party or violating its fiduciary duties.

                   (e)  Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal, or
rights to dissent from the Merger, that such Shareholder may have.

                   (f)  Shareholder shall execute and deliver to Parent the
Market Standoff Letter Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Annex B.

certificate representing Shares or New Shares reflecting the restrictions set
forth in this Agreement; and (ii) if Shareholder attempts to Transfer, vote or
provide any other person with the authority to vote any of the Shares other than
in compliance with this Agreement, Company shall not, and Shareholder hereby
irrevocably instructs Company not to permit any such transfer on its books and
records, issue a new certificate representing any of the Shares or New Shares or
record such vote unless and until Shareholder shall have complied with the terms
of this Agreement.

    6.  Additional Documents. Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute
        --------------------
and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable
opinion of Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

Shareholder may have.

    8.  Further Assurances. Shareholder will, from time to time, execute and
        ------------------
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further

the proxies set forth in Section 3.

    9.  Termination. Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 hereof and the Proxy delivered in
        -----------
connection herewith shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as

        ---------------
regarding this Agreement and the Transaction in strict confidence, and (ii) not
to divulge any such information to any third person, until such time as the
Transaction has been publicly disclosed by Parent.

    11. Miscellaneous.
        -------------

          11.1   Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
                 ------------
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants
and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

          11.2   Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the

                 ---------------------------------------
acknowledge that Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no

performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent at law
or in equity and Shareholder hereby waives any and all defenses which could

                        --------------------------------



          The undersigned shareholder of SoftAware, Inc., a California

California Corporations Code) appoints the members of the Board of Directors of
Digital Island, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and each of them, or
any other designee of Parent designated in writing, as the sole and exclusive
attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the full
extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with respect to all of the
shares of capital stock of Company that now are or hereafter may be beneficially
owned by the undersigned, and any and all other shares or securities of Company
issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively,
the "Shares") in accordance with the terms of this Irrevocable Proxy.  The
Shares beneficially owned by the undersigned shareholder of Company as of the
date of this Irrevocable Proxy are listed on the final page of this Irrevocable
Proxy.  Upon the undersigned's execution of this Irrevocable Proxy, any and all

revoked and the undersigned agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies with

          This Irrevocable Proxy is irrevocable (to the full extent provided in

ratios), and for Company to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the
"Merger").  As used herein, the term "Expiration" shall mean the earlier to
occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement, and
(ii) the date of termination of the Reorganization Agreement.

          The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them are hereby
authorized and empowered by the undersigned, at any time prior to the
Expiration, to act as the undersigned's attorney and proxy to vote the Shares,
and to exercise all voting and other rights of the undersigned with respect to
the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute and deliver
written consents pursuant to the California Corporations Code), at every annual,
special or adjourned meeting of the shareholders of Company and in every written
consent in lieu of such meeting in favor of approval and adoption of the
Reorganization Agreement and approval of the terms thereof and of the Merger and
each of the other transactions contemplated

                                       1

by the Reorganization Agreement, and in favor of any matter that could
reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, and against any Alternative
Transaction or Frustrating Transaction (as such terms are defined in the
Shareholder Agreement).

          The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this
Irrevocable Proxy on any other matter except as provided above.  The undersigned
shareholder may vote the Shares on all other matters.

          All authority herein conferred shall survive the death or incapacity
of the undersigned and any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be
binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the
undersigned.

                                   ---------

                      SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT


          THIS SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of the ___ day of July, 2000 between Digital Island, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned Shareholder ("Shareholder")
of SoftAware, Inc., a California corporation ("Company").  Capitalized terms
used and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Reorganization Agreement referred to below.


                                    RECITALS

          A.  Company and Parent have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of  July 17, 2000 (the "Reorganization Agreement"),
pursuant to which Ocean Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, will be merged with and into Company (the "Merger").

          B.  By virtue of the Merger and in connection therewith, Shareholder
will become the owner of shares of Common Stock of Parent (the "Parent Shares").

          C.  Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Parent and an agent (the
"Shareholders' Agent") of the former shareholders of Company will enter into the
Stock Escrow Agreement and Cash Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent.

          D.  Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Company, Parent and
their respective Securityholders, as well as legal counsel to Company and
Parent, are entitled to rely on (x) the truth and accuracy of Shareholder's
representations contained herein and (y) Shareholder's performance of the
obligations set forth herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements, provisions and covenants set forth in the Reorganization Agreement
and in this Shareholder's Agreement, it is hereby agreed as follows:

     1.  Share Ownership and Agreement to Retain Shares.
         ----------------------------------------------

         1.1  Transfer and Encumbrance.
              ------------------------

              (a) Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent that: (i)
Shareholder is the beneficial owner of that number of shares of Company Capital
Stock set forth on the signature page hereto (the "Shares") and, except as
otherwise set forth on the signature page hereto, did not acquire any Shares in
contemplation of the Merger; (ii) the Shares constitute Shareholder's entire
interest in the outstanding capital stock of Company; (iii) no other person or
entity not a signatory to this Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a right
to acquire the Shares or any portion of the Shares (except, with respect to
Shareholders which are partnerships, partners of such Shareholders); (iv)

                                       1
<PAGE>

the Shares are and will be at all times up until the Expiration free and clear
of any liens, claims, options, charges or other encumbrances (except with
respect to federal and state securities laws); and (v) Shareholder's principal
residence or place of business is accurately set forth on the signature page
hereto.

               (b) Shareholder agrees not to transfer (except as may be
specifically required by court order or by operation of law), sell, exchange,
pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares, or to make any offer or
agreement relating thereto, at any time on or prior to the Expiration. As used
herein, the term "Expiration" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) termination of the Reorganization Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

          1.2  New Shares.  Shareholder agrees that any shares of capital stock
               ----------
of Company that Shareholder purchases or with respect to which Shareholder
otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (including, without limitation, pursuant
to any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or the
like) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if
they constituted Shares.

     2.   Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder.
          --------------------------------------------------------

          2.1  Shareholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent
as follows:

               (a) Purchase Entirely for Own Account. The Parent Shares being
                   ---------------------------------
acquired by Shareholder pursuant to the Merger will be acquired for investment
for Shareholder's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to
the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and Shareholder has no present
intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing
the same. By executing this Agreement, Shareholder further represents that
Shareholder does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement
with any person to sell, transfer or grant participation to such person or to
any third person, with respect to any of such Parent Shares.

               (b) Investment Experience. Shareholder, either alone or with a
                   ---------------------
"purchaser representative" as described in subsection (c) below, has substantial
experience evaluating and investing in securities of companies and acknowledges
that it has the capacity to protect its own interests in connection therewith,
can bear the economic risk of its investment and has such knowledge and
experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of the investment in the Parent Shares. If other than an
individual, Shareholder also represents it has not been organized for the
purpose of acquiring the Parent Shares.

               (c) Accredited Investor/Suitability Questionnaire. On the date
                   ---------------------------------------------
hereof and at the Closing, Shareholder (i) is and will be an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as presently in effect or (ii)
meets the requirements of Section

                                       2
<PAGE>

2.1(b) above or (iii) has appointed a "purchaser representative" as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D to evaluate Shareholder's investment in Parent Shares.
Shareholder has delivered an Investor Suitability Questionnaire, in the form
attached as Annex A, to Parent describing Shareholder's ability to evaluate an
            -------
investment in Parent Shares.

               (d) Restricted Securities. Shareholder understands that the
                   ---------------------
Parent Shares constitute "restricted securities" under the federal securities
laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from Parent in a transaction not
involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations
such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), only in certain limited circumstances.
In this connection, Shareholder represents that Shareholder is familiar with
Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC, as presently in effect ("Rule 145"), and
understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

               (e) Further Limitations on Disposition. Shareholder agrees not to
                   ----------------------------------
offer, sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any
of the Parent Shares unless at that time:

                        (i) such transaction is permitted pursuant to the
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act;

                        (ii) counsel representing Shareholder, reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, shall have advised Parent in a written opinion letter
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Parent's counsel, and upon which Parent
and its counsel may rely, that no registration under the Securities Act is
required in connection with the proposed sale, transfer or other disposition;

                        (iii) a registration statement under the Securities Act
(a "Registration Statement") covering the Parent Shares proposed to be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of, describing the manner and terms of the
proposed sale, transfer or other disposition, and containing a current
prospectus, is filed with the SEC and made effective under the Securities Act;
provided, however, that use of and reliance on the Registration Statement will
--------  -------
be subject to customary "blackout" periods and, if Shareholder is an employee of
the Company or Parent at the time of a proposed offer, sale, exchange, transfer,
pledge or other disposition or encumbrance of the Parent Shares pursuant to such
registration statement, any applicable trading windows of Parent; or

                        (iv) an authorized representative of the SEC shall have
rendered written advice to Shareholder (sought by Shareholder or counsel to
Shareholder, with a copy thereof and of all other related communications
delivered to Parent) to the effect that the SEC will take no action, or that the
staff of the SEC will not recommend that the SEC take action, with respect to
the proposed offer, sale, exchange, transfer, pledge or other disposition or
encumbrance if consummated.

                (f) All certificates representing Parent Shares deliverable to
Shareholder pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement and in connection with the

                                       3
<PAGE>

Merger and any certificates subsequently issued with respect thereto or in
substitution therefor shall bear a legend that such shares of Parent Common
Stock may only be offered, sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged or disposed of
in accordance with this Agreement and with (i) the provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act, (ii) pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or
(iii) pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act.
Parent, at its discretion, may cause stop transfer orders to be placed with its
transfer agent with respect to the certificates for such Parent Shares but not
as to the certificates for any part of the Parent Shares as to which said legend
is no longer appropriate.

                (g) Shareholder will observe and comply with the Securities Act
and the General Rules and Regulations thereunder, as now in effect and as from
time to time amended and including those hereafter enacted or promulgated, in
connection with any offer, sale, exchange, transfer, pledge or other disposition
or encumbrance of the Parent Shares or any part thereof.

                (h) Shareholder understands that pursuant to the Reorganization
Agreement, Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall enter into the Stock Escrow
Agreement and Cash Escrow Agreement and that Shareholder shall be bound by the
provisions of the Stock Escrow Agreement and Cash Escrow Agreement in the forms
attached as exhibits to the Reorganization Agreement and Article VIII of the
Reorganization Agreement ("Article VIII"); and as such, Shareholder agrees to
the appointment of the person or persons identified therein as the Shareholders'
Agent and further agrees to be bound by the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement,
Cash Escrow Agreement and Article VIII.

     3.  Additional Documents and Actions.  Shareholder hereby covenants and
         --------------------------------
agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents and take any actions
necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement.

     4.  Consent and Waiver.  Shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
         ------------------
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement (the "Transaction") under the terms
of any agreement to which Shareholder is a party or pursuant to any contracted
rights Shareholder may have.

     5.  Confidentiality.  Shareholder agrees (i) to hold any information
         ---------------
regarding this Agreement and the Transaction in strict confidence, and (ii) not
to divulge any such information to any third person, until such time as the
Transaction has been publicly disclosed by Parent.

     6.  Miscellaneous.
         -------------

         6.1  Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
              ------------
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of

                                       4
<PAGE>

this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

          6.2  Binding Effect and Assignment.  This Agreement and all of the
               -----------------------------
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors, but, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties.

          6.3  Amendment and Modification.  This Agreement may not be modified,
               --------------------------
amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto.

          6.4  Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief.  The parties hereto
               ---------------------------------------
acknowledge that Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no
adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Shareholder set forth herein.  Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation, Parent
shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific
performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent at law
or in equity and Shareholder hereby waives any and all defenses which could
exist in its favor in connection with such enforcement and waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
enforcement.

          6.5  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands or other communications
               -------

                             STOCK ESCROW AGREEMENT
                             ----------------------



          This STOCK ESCROW AGREEMENT is made as of ________________, 2000, by
and among State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A. (the "Escrow
Agent"), DIGITAL ISLAND, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Mark
Cronan, as agent (the "Shareholders' Agent") of the former shareholders of
SOFTAWARE, INC., a California corporation ("Company").  The parties hereto other
than the Escrow Agent agree among themselves that terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Reorganization Agreement (as
defined below).  Terms defining the Escrow Agent's duties hereunder are defined
herein and the Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the
Reorganization, other than Article VIII (defined below).

                                   WITNESSETH

          WHEREAS, Parent, Company and Ocean Acquisition Corp., a California
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), have entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement"),
dated as of July 17, 2000, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Company, with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent  (the
"Merger"); and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to Article VIII of the Reorganization Agreement, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A ("Article VIII"), an escrow fund
                                    -------
(the "Stock Escrow Fund") will be established to compensate Parent for certain
Damages, if any, arising out of any misrepresentation or breach or default in
connection with any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
given or made by Company in the Reorganization Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule or any Ancillary Agreement; and

          WHEREAS, the Shareholders' Agent has been constituted as agent for and
on behalf of the former shareholders of Company (individually, a "Shareholder"
and collectively, the "Shareholders") to undertake certain obligations specified
in Article VIII; and

          WHEREAS, Article VIII provides for a Stock Escrow Fund of Escrow
Shares representing fifteen percent (15%) of the Merger Shares to be delivered
to the Shareholders and pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, such escrow to
be held by the Escrow Agent; and

          WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to set forth further terms and
conditions in addition to those set forth in Article VIII relating to the
operation of the Stock Escrow Fund;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

          1.  Escrow and Escrow Shares.  Pursuant to Article VIII, Parent shall
              ------------------------
deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent, within five (5)
business days of the Effective Time, a stock certificate or certificates
representing 1,406,250 shares (the "Escrow Shares"),

                                       1

<PAGE>

which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the
Shareholders who are the beneficial owners of such shares. The Escrow Shares
shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms
and conditions of Article VIII and this Agreement. The number of Escrow Shares
beneficially owned by each Shareholder, the percentage interest of each
Shareholder in the Stock Escrow Fund, the address of each Shareholder and the
taxpayer identification number of each Shareholder are set forth in Annex B
                                                                    -------
attached hereto. Whenever any fact set forth in Annex B changes, Parent shall
                                                -------
deliver a revised version of Annex B to the Escrow Agent. Unless and until the
                             -------
Escrow Agent shall receive such revised version, the Escrow Agent may assume
without inquiry that the last Annex B it has received has not been, and is not
                              -------
required to be, amended and remains in full force and effect.

          2.  Rights and Obligations of the Parties.  The Escrow Agent shall be
              --------------------------------------
entitled to such rights and shall perform such duties of the escrow agent as set
forth herein and in Article VIII (collectively, the "Duties"), in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Stock Escrow Agreement and Article VIII.
Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled to their respective rights
and shall perform their respective duties and obligations as set forth herein
and in Article VIII, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.  In the
event that the terms of this Stock Escrow Agreement conflict in any way with the
provisions of Article VIII, Article VIII shall control.

          3.  Escrow Period.  The Escrow Period shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
              -------------
P.S.T. on the first anniversary of the Effective Time; provided, however, that a
                                                       --------  -------
portion of the Escrow Shares, which in the reasonable judgment of Parent as set
forth in a certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the termination of
the Escrow Period, subject to the objection of the Shareholders' Agent and any
subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 8.6 of
Article VIII, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer's Certificate received by the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the
Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to
expiration of the Escrow Period (an "Outstanding Claim Certificate"), shall
remain in the Stock Escrow Fund until such claims have been resolved.  Parent
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the Effective Time at
the time of the initial deposit of the Stock Escrow Fund.

          4.  Duties of Escrow Agent.  In addition to the Duties set forth in
              -----------------------
Article VIII, the Duties of the Escrow Agent shall include the following:

              (a) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Shares
during the Escrow Period, shall treat such Stock Escrow Fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Stock Escrow Agreement and Article VIII and
not as the property of Parent, and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Shares
only in accordance with the terms hereof.

              (b) The Escrow Shares shall be voted by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the specific written instructions received by the Escrow Agent
from the Shareholders who are the beneficial owners of such shares as to how
such shares are to be voted. The Escrow Agent need not solicit voting
instructions. In the absence of such instructions, the Escrow Agent shall be
under no obligation to vote such shares. The Escrow Agent need not forward proxy
information, annual or other reports or other information received from Parent
with respect to the Escrow Shares.

                                       2

<PAGE>

              (c) Promptly following termination of the Escrow Period, the
Escrow Agent shall requisition from Parent's stock transfer agent if necessary,
and shall deliver or cause such transfer agent to deliver to the Shareholders,
in accordance with their percentage interests set forth in Annex B hereto, their
                                                           -------
portions of the Escrow Shares and other property in the Stock Escrow Fund in
excess of the amount of such Escrow Shares or other property set forth in an
Outstanding Claim Certificate, and to pay expenses as provided in Section 11(b)
hereof. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver or cause Parent's stock transfer agent to deliver to the Shareholders,
in accordance with their interests set forth in Annex B hereto, all of the
Escrow Shares and other property remaining in the Stock Escrow Fund and
not required to satisfy such claims and expenses.

              (d) Pursuant to Section 8.4 of the Reorganization Agreement, for
the purpose of compensating Parent for its Damages pursuant to this Agreement,
the Parent Common Stock in the Stock Escrow Fund shall be valued at the Escrow
Value. If the value to be distributed to Parent (or to any Shareholder upon a
termination of the escrow) is not evenly divisible by the Escrow Value, the
Escrow Agent shall round down the number of shares to be distributed to the next
highest number of shares and shall distribute that number. In lieu of the
fractional interest not distributed, Parent shall furnish to the Escrow Agent,
and the Escrow Agent in turn will distribute to the Shareholders, in accordance
with their percentage interests set forth in Annex B hereto, cash equal to such
                                             -------
fractional interest multiplied by the Escrow Value. Parent shall be deemed to
have purchased such fractional interests with respect to which it has furnished
funds to the Escrow Agent. Accordingly, the Escrow Agent, upon receipt of such
funds, shall deliver the corresponding number of shares to Parent. In all
events, Parent shall so purchase only a whole number of shares. Any cash so
received from Parent and not so immediately distributed by the Escrow Agent
shall be retained by the Escrow Agent as part of the Stock Escrow Fund, but need
not be invested.

          5.  Distribution.  Any cash dividends, dividends payable in securities
              ------------
or other distributions of any kind (but excluding any shares of Parent capital
stock received upon a stock split or stock dividend unless such stock dividend
or stock split is taxable to the Shareholder who is the beneficial owner of such
shares pursuant to Section 301 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended)
shall be promptly distributed by the Escrow Agent upon receipt to the beneficial
holders of the Escrow Shares to which such distribution relates in their
percentage interest as set forth in Annex B and subject to Section 14 hereof.
Any amounts held pending such distribution shall be held uninvested as cash.
Except as set forth above, any shares of Parent Common Stock received by the
Escrow Agent upon a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reorganization or the like made in respect of any securities in the Stock Escrow
Fund shall be added to the Stock Escrow Fund and become a part thereof.  Any
provision hereof and of Article VIII shall be adjusted to appropriately reflect
any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, recapitalization,
reorganization, merger or the like and a new version of Annex A shall be
                                                        -------
provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.

          6.  Exculpatory Provisions.
              ----------------------

              (a) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance
of such Duties as are specifically set forth herein and in Article VIII and may
rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
instrument reasonably believed to be

                                       3

<PAGE>

genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The
Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of any document or agreement
except for this Agreement and Article VIII. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for forgeries or false impersonations. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as escrow agent except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall in no case or event be
liable for any representations or warranties of Company or Parent. Any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice or opinion of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of the good faith of the Escrow Agent and such opinion shall be full
and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or
omitted by Escrow Agent in accordance herewith.

              (b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard
any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person,
excepting only orders or process of courts of law or arbitration as provided in
Section 8.6 of the Reorganization Agreement, and is hereby expressly authorized
to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court or rulings of
any arbitrators. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court or such ruling of any arbitrator, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by
reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or
arbitrators' ruling being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside,
vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

              (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account
of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver the Reorganization Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for thereunder.

              (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the restriction of
any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to the Reorganization
Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

          7.  Alteration of Duties.  The Duties may be altered, amended,
              --------------------
modified or revoked only by a writing signed by all of the parties hereto.

          8.  Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow Agent may
              -------------------------------------------
resign as Escrow Agent at any time with or without cause by giving at least
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to each of Parent and the Shareholders'
Agent, such resignation to be effective thirty (30) days following the date such
notice is given.  In addition, Parent and Shareholders' Agent may jointly remove
the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without cause, by an
instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the Escrow Agent,
which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal.  In the
event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow agent which shall
be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of the State of California having (or if such bank or trust company
is a member of a bank company, its bank holding company has) a combined capital
and surplus of not less than $50,000,000, shall be appointed by the
Shareholders' Agent with the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  If the parties fail to agree on a successor Escrow Agent
within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a

                                       4

<PAGE>

successor Escrow Agent. The successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor
Escrow Agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates,
property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if
originally named as an Escrow Agent herein. Any such successor escrow agent
shall deliver to Parent and the Shareholders' Agent a written instrument
accepting such appointment, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and
duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder and shall be entitled to receive the Stock
Escrow Fund.

          9.  Further Instruments.  If the Escrow Agent reasonably requires
              -------------------
other or further instruments in connection with performance of the Duties, the
necessary parties hereto shall join in furnishing such instruments.

          10.  Disputes.  It is understood and agreed that should any dispute
               --------
arise with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of
the securities or other property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow
Agent is authorized and directed to act in accordance with, and in reliance
upon, the terms hereof and of Article VIII.

          11.  Escrow Fees and Expenses.
               ------------------------

              (a) Parent shall pay the Escrow Agent such fees as are established
by the Fee Schedule attached hereto as Annex C and all reasonable
                                       -------
"out-of-pocket" expenses incurred while serving as Escrow Agent (including
reasonable counsel fees).

              (b) Any out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the
Shareholders' Agent (including any loss, liability or expense for which the
Shareholders' Agent is to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.7(b) of the
Reorganization Agreement) may be paid out of the Stock Escrow Fund, but only at
the end of the Escrow Period and only to the extent any amounts remain after all
other distributions from the Stock Escrow Fund and the final resolution of any
claims thereon. Escrow Agent shall disburse said amounts, if any, upon receipt
of a written request of the Shareholders' Agent. At least two business days
prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period, the Shareholders' Agent shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the amount of such fees
and expenses that are to be paid out of the Stock Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent
may rely on such certificate without inquiry and may assume that, if the Escrow
Agent has not received such a certificate, no such fees and expenses are
payable.

          12.  Indemnification.  In consideration of the Escrow Agent's
               ---------------
acceptance of this appointment, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow
Agent and its officers, directors, employees, counsel and agents harmless as to
any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by it to any person, firm or
corporation by reason of its having accepted such appointment or in carrying out
the terms hereof and of Article VIII, and to reimburse the Escrow Agent for all
its costs and expenses, including, among other things, counsel fees and
expenses, reasonably incurred by reason of any matter as to which an indemnity
is paid; provided, however, that no indemnity need be paid in case of the Escrow
         --------  -------
Agent's negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.  In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damages.

          13.  General.

                              ---------------------

and among State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A. (the "Escrow
Agent"), DIGITAL ISLAND, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Mark
Cronan, as agent (the "Shareholders' Agent") of the former shareholders of
SOFTAWARE, INC., a California corporation ("Company").  The parties hereto other
than the Escrow Agent agree among themselves that terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Reorganization Agreement (as
defined below).  Terms defining the Escrow Agent's duties hereunder are defined
herein and the Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the
Reorganization Agreement, other than Article VIII (as defined below).

                                   WITNESSETH

          WHEREAS, Parent, Company and Ocean Acquisition Corp., a California
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), have entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement"),
dated as of July 17, 2000, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Company, with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent  (the
"Merger"); and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to Article VIII of the Reorganization Agreement, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A ("Article VIII"), an escrow fund
                                    -------
(the "Cash Escrow Fund") will be established to compensate Parent for certain
Damages, if any, arising out of any misrepresentation or breach or default in
connection with any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
given or made by Company in the Reorganization Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule or any Ancillary Agreement; and

          WHEREAS, the Shareholders' Agent has been constituted as agent for and
on behalf of the former shareholders of Company (individually, a "Shareholder"
and collectively, the "Shareholders") to undertake certain obligations specified
in Article VIII; and

          WHEREAS, Article VIII provides for a Cash Escrow Fund of Escrow Cash
representing fifteen percent (15%) of the Merger Cash to be delivered to the
Shareholders when and if released from the Cash Escrow Fund and pursuant to the
Reorganization Agreement, such escrow to be held by the Escrow Agent;

          WHEREAS, it is intended by the parties hereto that Parent retain all
rights and title to the Escrow Cash until such time, if any, that such Escrow
Cash is released from the Cash Escrow; and

          WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to set forth further terms and
conditions in addition to those set forth in Article VIII relating to the
operation of the Cash Escrow Fund;

                                       1
<PAGE>

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

          1.  Escrow and Escrow Cash.  Pursuant to Article VIII, Parent shall
              ----------------------
deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent, within five (5)
business days of the Effective Time $3,000,000 in cash (the "Escrow Cash").  The
Escrow Cash shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms and conditions of Article VIII and this Cash Escrow Agreement.  The
amount of Escrow Cash which may be released from the escrow to each Shareholder,
the percentage interest of each Shareholder in the Cash Escrow Fund, the address
of each Shareholder and the taxpayer identification number of each Shareholder
are set forth in Annex B attached hereto.  Whenever any fact set forth in Annex
                 -------
B changes, Parent shall deliver a revised version of Annex B to the Escrow
                                                     -------
Agent.  Unless and until the Escrow Agent shall receive such revised version,
the Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that the last Annex B it has
received has not been, and is not required to be, amended and remains in full
force and effect.

          2.  Rights and Obligations of the Parties.  The Escrow Agent shall be
              --------------------------------------
entitled to such rights and shall perform such duties of the escrow agent as set
forth herein and in Article VIII (collectively, the "Duties"), in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Cash Escrow Agreement and Article VIII.
Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled to their respective rights
and shall perform their respective duties and obligations as set forth herein
and in Article VIII, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.  In the
event that the terms of this Cash Escrow Agreement conflict in any way with the
provisions of Article VIII, Article VIII shall control.

          3.  Escrow Period.  The Escrow Period shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
              -------------
P.S.T. on the first anniversary of the Effective Time; provided, however, that a
                                                       --------  -------
portion of the Escrow Cash, which in the reasonable judgment of Parent as set
forth in a certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the termination of
the Escrow Period, subject to the objection of the Shareholders' Agent and any
subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 8.6 of
Article VIII, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer's Certificate received by the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the
Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to
expiration of the Escrow Period (an "Outstanding Claim Certificate"), shall
remain in the Cash Escrow Fund until such claims have been resolved.  Parent
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the Effective Time at
the time of the initial deposit of the Cash Escrow Fund.

          4.  Duties of Escrow Agent.  In addition to the Duties set forth in
              -----------------------
Article VIII, the Duties of the Escrow Agent shall include the following:

              (a) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Cash
during the Escrow Period, shall treat such Cash Escrow Fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Cash Escrow Agreement and Article VIII shall
hold and dispose of the Escrow Cash only in accordance with the terms hereof.

              (b) Promptly following termination of the Escrow Period, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Shareholders pursuant to their percentage
interests set forth in Annex B
                       -------

                                       2

<PAGE>

hereto, their portion of the Escrow Cash and other property in the Cash Escrow
Fund in excess of the amount of such Escrow Cash or other property set forth in
a certificate of the Parent as being sufficient to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Officer's Certificate received by the Escrow Agent prior
to termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances
existing prior to expiration of the Escrow Period, and to pay expenses as
provided in Section 10(b) hereof. As soon as all such claims have been resolved,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Shareholders their interests set forth in
Annex B hereto, all of the Escrow Cash and other property remaining in the Cash
-------
Escrow Fund and not required to satisfy such claims and expenses.

     5.  Exculpatory Provisions.
         ----------------------

              (a) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance
of such Duties as are specifically set forth herein and in Article VIII and may
rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be charged
with knowledge of any document or agreement except for this Agreement and
Article VIII. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for forgeries or false
impersonations. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as escrow agent except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall in no case or event be liable for any
representations or warranties of Company or Parent. Any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice or opinion of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of the
good faith of the Escrow Agent and such opinion shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by Escrow
Agent in accordance herewith.

              (b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard
any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person,
excepting only orders or process of courts of law or arbitration as provided in
Section 8.6 of the Reorganization Agreement, and is hereby expressly authorized
to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court or rulings of
any arbitrators. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court or such ruling of any arbitrator, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by
reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or
arbitrators' ruling being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside,
vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

              (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account
of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver the Reorganization Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for thereunder.

              (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the restriction of
any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to the Reorganization
Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

          6.  Alteration of Duties.  The Duties may be altered, amended,
              --------------------
modified or revoked only by a writing signed by all of the parties hereto.

                                       3

<PAGE>

          7.  Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow Agent may
              -------------------------------------------
resign as Escrow Agent at any time with or without cause by giving at least
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to each of Parent and the Shareholders'
Agent, such resignation to be effective thirty (30) days following the date such
notice is given.  In addition, Parent and Shareholders' Agent may jointly remove
the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without cause, by an
instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the Escrow Agent,
which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal.  In the
event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow agent which shall
be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of the State of California having (or if such bank or trust company
is a member of a bank company, its bank holding company has) a combined capital
and surplus of not less than $50,000,000, shall be appointed by the
Shareholders' Agent with the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  Any such successor escrow agent shall deliver to Parent
and the Shareholders' Agent a written instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the Escrow Agent
hereunder and shall be entitled to receive the Cash Escrow Fund.

          8.  Further Instruments.  If the Escrow Agent reasonably requires
              -------------------
other or further instruments in connection with performance of the Duties, the
necessary parties hereto shall join in furnishing such instruments.

          9.  Disputes.  It is understood and agreed that should any dispute
              --------
arise with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of
the securities or other property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow
Agent is authorized and directed to act in accordance with, and in reliance
upon, the terms hereof and of Article VIII.

          10. Escrow Fees and Expenses.
              ------------------------

              (a) Parent shall pay the Escrow Agent such fees as are established
by the Fee Schedule attached hereto as Annex C and all reasonable
                                       -------
"out-of-pocket" expenses incurred while serving as Escrow Agent (including
reasonable counsel fees).

              (b) Any out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the
Shareholders' Agent (including any loss, liability or expense for which the
Shareholders' Agent is to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.7(b) of the
Reorganization Agreement) may be paid out of the Cash Escrow Fund, but only at
the end of the Escrow Period and only to the extent any amounts remain after all
other distributions from the Cash Escrow Fund and the final resolution of any
claims thereon. Escrow Agent shall disburse said amounts, if any, upon receipt
of a written request of the Shareholders' Agent. At least two business days
prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period, the Shareholders' Agent shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the amount of such fees
and expenses that are to be paid out of the Cash Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent
may rely on such certificate without inquiry and may assume that, if the Escrow
Agent has not received such a certificate, no such fees and expenses are
payable.

          11. Indemnification.  In consideration of the Escrow Agent's
              ---------------
acceptance of this appointment, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow
Agent and its officers, directors, employees, counsel and agents harmless as to
any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by it to any person, firm or
corporation by reason of its having accepted such


                                       4

<PAGE>

appointment or in carrying out the terms hereof and of Article VIII, and to
reimburse the Escrow Agent for all its costs and expenses, including, among
other things, counsel fees and expenses, reasonably incurred by reason of any
matter as to which an indemnity is paid; provided, however, that no indemnity
                                         --------  -------
need be paid in case of the Escrow Agent's negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or
consequential loss or damages.

  Re:  Employment Agreement
  ------------------------------

Dear ^FirstName^:

          We are pleased to offer you employment with Digital Island, Inc. (the
"Company").  This letter, if accepted, would take effect as of the date of the
closing of the Company's acquisition of all the outstanding stock of your
current employer, SoftAware, Inc. (the "Closing Date"), and sets forth the terms
of your employment with the Company which would be as follows:

Conditions
----------

          This offer is contingent on the closing of the Company's acquisition
of SoftAware, Inc. (the "Acquisition") and, if the Acquisition does not close,
this offer will be null and void.  This offer also is contingent upon your
concurrent execution, and your agreement that you shall comply at all relevant
times with the Company's Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement (the
"CIIA"), a copy of which is enclosed.

Position
--------

          We are pleased to offer you full time employment in a position to be
determined, reporting to another position, to be identified no later than the
Closing Date.  You will have whatever reasonable duties and responsibilities
that are assigned to you consistent with your position and the Company's
business needs for your position.  During the one (1) year time period following
the Closing Date, you will not be required to relocate your principal place of
employment more than fifty (50) miles unless mutually agreed upon by you and the
Company.

                                       1
<PAGE>

     During your employment with the Company you shall devote your full business
time, best efforts, abilities, energies and skills to the good faith performance
of your duties and responsibilities, and you shall not engage in any other
employment, business, or business related activity unless you receive the
Company's prior written approval from your direct supervisor and the Company's
Vice President of Human Resources (or if no such position exists, the Director
of Human Resources), which shall not be unreasonably withheld if such outside
employment, business or activity would not in any way be competitive with the
business or proposed business of the Company or otherwise conflict with or
adversely affect in any way the performance of your duties and responsibilities
of your position.

Compensation and Benefits
-------------------------

     You will receive an annual base salary of ^Base^Salary^, less all
applicable tax and withholding deductions, paid at periodic intervals in
accordance with the Company's payroll practices for salaried employees.

     You also will be eligible to participate in the Company's Bonus Plan,
subject to its terms and conditions, with an initial annual bonus target of
$^Bonus^.  Currently, the Bonus Plan is structured to make quarterly bonus
payments although it is anticipated to be changed beginning October 1, 2000 to
make semi-annual bonus payments.  The Bonus Plan is currently structured to make
payments based upon: (i) the Company's achievement of the financial objectives
and performance milestones established by the Company's Board of Directors (the
"Board") for each bonus payment period, (ii) your achievement of individual
performance objectives for such bonus payment period, and (iii) your continued
employment through the close of each bonus payment period.

     In addition, you shall be eligible to participate in all employee benefits
generally made available to employees of the Company from time to time,
including group insurance and health and welfare benefit plans, as well as such
benefits that the Company makes available to those employed in the same level of
position as you, provided that you meet the relevant qualification criteria for
such benefits.  Subject to the policies in effect from time to time, you
initially shall accrue paid time off ("PTO") benefits at least at the annual
rate of fifteen (15) days and such additional amount of PTO as determined by the
date you commenced employment with SoftAware, Inc.  For the purpose of rate of
accrual of PTO benefits, you shall be credited with time actively employed by
SoftAware, Inc.

     Finally, subject to the policies in effect from time to time, you shall be
entitled to receive reimbursement from the Company for all necessary business
expenses you incur in the performance of your job duties and responsibilities.

Stock Option Grant
------------------

     As soon as possible following the Closing Date, you will be granted a stock
option to purchase ^Option^ shares of the Company's common stock at exercise
price per share equal to the fair market value per share on the grant date.  The
option will be an incentive stock option under the Federal tax laws, to the
maximum extent allowable, and the balance will be a non-statutory option.  The
option will have a maximum term of ten (10) years, subject to earlier

                                       2
<PAGE>

termination upon your cessation of employment.  The option will vest and become
exercisable for twenty-five percent (25%) of the option shares upon your
completion of one year of employment with the Company and, thereafter, will vest
and become exercisable for the balance of the option shares in a series of
thirty-six (36) successive equal monthly installments, upon your completion of
each of the next thirty-six (36) months of employment.  The remaining terms of
the option will be governed by the provisions of the Company's 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan.

Term of Employment
------------------

          You agree to remain employed by the Company for a period of one (1)
year after the Closing Date.  Thereafter, your employment will be for an
indefinite period.  Nevertheless and subject to the provisions below, the
Company may terminate your employment at any time for any reason, with or
without cause, by giving you written notice of such termination.

     Upon any termination of your employment, you will be paid all base salary
and any accrued but unused PTO benefits earned through the date of termination,
as well as any payment owed to you under the Bonus Plan.  You also will be
entitled to continue eligible health and welfare benefits for you and/or your
dependents pursuant to the federal law know as COBRA.  All other employee
benefits will terminate as of the date of termination.  Unless your stock or
stock option agreement(s), or any stock acceleration waiver provide otherwise,
stock and option vesting also would cease as of the date of termination,
although you would be allowed to exercise your vested and outstanding options
during the time period set forth in, and in accordance with, your stock or stock
option agreement(s).

          If: (i) prior to one (1) year after the Closing Date, the Company
terminates your employment "Without Cause," or (ii) you were to resign because
the Company breached of any of its obligations under this Agreement and failed
to correct such breach after you had given thirty (30) days written notice of
the breach to the Vice President of Human Resources (or if no such position
exists, to the Director of Human Resource), the Company will pay you the
prorated bonus potential for the specific bonus payment period during which your
employment terminated, and will continue your base salary as severance for a
period of one (1) year after the termination of your employment provided,
however, such severance shall be offset by all amounts you receive, earn or are
guaranteed as a result of employment and/or consulting services you provide to
any person or entity during the one (1) year period after the termination of
your employment.  You will notify the Company in writing within five (5) days of
your acceptance of any employment or consulting, and provide such information as
reasonably requested by the Company necessary to determine the amount of each
severance payment to which you are entitled throughout the one year period after
the termination of your employment.

          If, prior to one (1) year after the Closing Date: (i) you die, or (ii)
because of disability become unable to perform for more than ninety (90)
consecutive days, the essential functions of your position either with or
without reasonable accommodation, you or your estate will be entitled to receive
severance in an amount equal to one (1) year of your base salary in effect at
the time of your death or disability.

     If, prior to one (1) year after the Closing Date: (i) you were to resign
for any reason other than because the Company breached of any of its obligations
under this Agreement and failed to

                                       3
<PAGE>

timely correct the breach, or (ii) your employment were to be terminated by the
Company for "Cause," you will not receive any severance. A termination for
"Cause" shall mean a termination for any of the following reasons: (i) your
conviction or plea of nolo contendre to a felony offense; (ii) committing an act
of fraud against the Company, misappropriation of Company property, or
embezzlement of the Company funds; (iii) breach of one or more obligations of
this agreement or any provision of the CIIA; (iv) intentional misconduct; or (v)
your failure to perform the duties of your position which is not cured or
remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written warning regarding
such failure. The Company will provide written notice of the reason for
termination in the event of any termination for "Cause." A termination for any
other reason shall be a termination "Without Cause."

          The severance set forth herein will be in lieu of any entitlement you
may have to notice of termination, pay in lieu of notice of termination, or any
other severance payment from any other source.

          If your employment with the Company continues after one (1) year
beyond the Closing Date, then your employment would continue to be on an "at-
will" basis.  This means that either you or the Company may terminate the
employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and
without any obligation to you except as may be required by applicable wage laws
or any Company-sponsored employee benefit plans.  It also means that the Company
may change at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, the terms and
conditions of your employment, including but not limited to job title, duties
and responsibilities, compensation and benefits, and reporting level.

continue until the earlier of: (i) the expiration of the six (6) month
                        -------
period measured from the effective date of his Involuntary Termination, or (ii)
the first date on which Executive is covered under another employer's health
benefit program without exclusion for any pre-existing medical condition. Any

                                       6
<PAGE>

          19.3  Change in Control Severance.  Should Executive's employment with
                ---------------------------
the Corporation terminate by reason of an Involuntary Termination within twelve
(12) months after a Change in Control, then Executive shall become entitled to
receive the following:

                (a)  Bonus Payment.  Payment of the prorated bonus potential for
                     -------------
the specific bonus payment period during which Executive's employment
terminated.

                (b)  Salary Continuation.  Salary continuation payments, at the
                     -------------------
monthly rate of base salary in effect for him under Paragraph 2 just prior to
the time of the event resulting in his Involuntary Termination, for a period of
twelve (12) months. Such salary continuation payments shall be paid at periodic
intervals in accordance with the Corporation's payroll practices for salaried
Executives, and shall be subject to all applicable tax withholding requirements.

                (c)  Health Care Coverage.  Continued health care coverage under
                     --------------------

                     -------------------
stock options do not vest on an accelerated basis at the time of the Change in
Control because those options are assumed by the successor entity or are
otherwise continued in effect following that Change in Control, then Executive
shall immediately, upon an Involuntary Termination of his employment with the
Corporation (or the successor entity) within twelve (12) months after the
effective date of that Change in Control, be credited with an additional twelve
(12) months of service under the vesting schedule in effect for the shares
purchased or purchasable under each of his stock options. Accordingly, Executive
shall immediately vest in that number of additional shares purchased or
purchasable under each such stock option equal to the number of additional
shares in which Executive would have vested under the normal vesting schedule in
effect for that stock option had Executive actually rendered an additional
twelve (12) months of service with the Corporation prior to the date of such
Involuntary Termination. Executive shall have until the earlier of: (i) the
                                                        -------
expiration of the option term, or (ii) any shorter period designated in the
stock option agreement within which to exercise each of his stock options for
any or all of the option shares in which Executive is vested at the time of his
Involuntary Termination, including the option shares which vest on an
accelerated basis in accordance with the foregoing provisions.

    20. Restrictive Covenants.  During the Employment Period and for an
        ---------------------
additional period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive's
employment for any reason other than death, Executive shall be subject to the
following restrictive covenants:

          20.1   Executive shall not directly or indirectly encourage or solicit
any of the Corporation's employees, consultants or independent contractors to
leave the Corporation's

                                       7
<PAGE>

employ or service for any reason or interfere in any other manner with such
relationships at the time existing between the Corporation and its employees,
consultants and independent contractors.

          20.2   Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit any
customer, vendor, supplier, licensor, licensee or other business affiliate of
the Corporation or otherwise induce any such person to terminate its existing
business relationship with the Corporation or interfere in any other manner with
any existing business relationship between the Corporation and any such
customer, vendor, supplier, licensor, licensee or other business affiliate.

          20.3   Executive shall not, as an Executive, agent, consultant,
advisor, independent contractor, general partner, officer, director,
stockholder, investor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or
other entity, or in any other capacity directly or indirectly:


                 (a) render any services relating to IP networks or internet
access and related value added services (including without limitation those
operations of Worldcom/UUnet, PSINet, Digex, Verio, Earthlink/Mindspring, AT&T,
SBC, Quest, GTE/BBN); any "last mile" high speed DSL access services (including
without limitation those operations of TCI@Home, Rhythms, Covad); any data
center outsourcing services or the hosting division of companies (including
without limitation those operations of Exodus, Intel, Colo.com, IBM); or any
networks that serve content in one or two ways to multiple devices distributed
throughout deployed networks of distributed servers (including without
limitation those operations of Adero, Akamai, Real Broadcast Networks)
(hereafter collectively referred to as the "Businesses") in the United States or
throughout the world; or

                 (b)  permit Executive's name to be used in connection with a
business which is competitive or substantially similar to the Businesses.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, up to one percent (1%) of any class of
"publicly traded securities" of any business that is competitive or
substantially similar to the Businesses or any person who owns a business that
is competitive or substantially similar to the Businesses.  The term "publicly
traded securities" shall mean securities that are traded on a national
securities exchange or listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or Bulletin Board.

          20.4   The parties agree that if any of the foregoing restrictive
covenants is found by a court to be unreasonable, the court shall reduce and
limit such covenants to such area, scope or period as shall be deemed reasonable
and the parties shall comply with such reductions and limitations.

          20.5   Executive hereby acknowledges that monetary damages may not be
sufficient to compensate the Corporation for any economic loss which may be
incurred by reason of Executive's breach of the foregoing restrictive covenants.
Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, the Corporation shall, in addition
to the termination of this Agreement and any remedies available to the
Corporation at law, be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of an
injunction precluding Executive from continuing such breach, or in the form of a
decree

                                       8
<PAGE>

requiring specific performance of the covenants set forth herein.

    21. Limitations on Severance Benefits.
        ---------------------------------

          21.1   The benefits provided Executive under Paragraph 8 of this
Agreement are the only severance benefits, or measure of damages or loss, to
which Executive is entitled under this Agreement upon the termination of his
employment with the Corporation, and no other severance benefits shall be
provided to Executive by the Corporation pursuant to any other severance plan or
program of the Corporation.

          21.2    In the event Executive breaches any of his obligations under
Paragraphs 6 or 9 of this Agreement, Executive shall cease to be entitled to any
severance benefits otherwise to be provided under Paragraph 8 this Agreement;
the Corporation shall be entitled to recover from Executive any and all stock
options that vested and any shares for which such options were exercised (or the
market value of the shares for which such options were exercised if Executive
had exercised any or all such options) pursuant to Paragraph 8.c.(4) of this
Agreement; and, further, the Corporation shall be entitled to take any and all
action necessary to pursue legal and equitable remedies against Executive,
including, without limitation, injunctive relief; provided, however, this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such action
by the Corporation.

    22. Governing Law.  The provisions of this Agreement will be construed
        -------------
and interpreted under the laws of the State of California applicable to
agreements executed and to be wholly performed within the State of California.
If any provision of this Agreement as applied to any party or to any
circumstance should be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void
or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity of that provision shall in no
way affect (to the maximum extent permissible by law) the application of such
provision under circumstances different from those adjudicated by the court, the
application of any other provision of this Agreement, or the enforceability or
invalidity of this Agreement as a whole.  Should any provision of this Agreement
become or be deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by
reason of the scope, extent or duration of its coverage, then such provision
shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so
as to be valid and enforceable or, if such provision cannot be so amended
without materially altering the intention of the parties, then such provision
will be stricken and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect.

    23. Remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all rights and remedies
        --------
provided pursuant to this Agreement or by law shall be cumulative, and no such
right or remedy shall be exclusive of any other.  A party may pursue any one or
more rights or remedies hereunder or may seek damages or specific performance in
the event of another party's breach hereunder or may pursue any other available
remedy.

    24.  Arbitration. Any and all disputes between Executive and the Corporation
         -----------
which arise out of Executive's employment under the terms of this Agreement or
the termination of such employment shall be resolved through final and binding
arbitration. This shall include, without limitation, disputes relating to this
Agreement, Executive's employment by the Corporation or the termination thereof,
claims for breach of contract or breach of the

                                       9
<PAGE>

covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and any claims of discrimination or
other claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act, or any other Federal, State or local
law or regulation now in existence or hereinafter enacted and as amended from
time to time concerning in any way the subject of Executive's employment with
the Corporation or its termination. The only claims not covered by this
                                                    ---
Agreement are Executive's claims for benefits under the workers' compensation or
unemployment insurance laws, which will be resolved pursuant to those laws; and
any claims by the Corporation or the by Executive arising from or relating to
Paragraphs 6 or 9 of this Agreement. Binding arbitration will be conducted in
San Francisco, California, accordance with existing procedures for resolution of
employment disputes of the American Arbitration Association unless Executive
does not reside within one hundred (100) miles of San Francisco County at the
time the dispute arose, in which case arbitration may take place in the largest
metropolitan area within one hundred (100) miles of Executive's most recent
principal place of employment with the Corporation. Each party will share
equally the cost of the arbitration filing and hearing fees, and the cost of the
arbitrator, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover his/its
reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred with respect to the arbitration.
The parties understand and agree that the arbitration shall be instead of any
civil litigation and that each is waiving the right to a jury trial as to such
claims. The parties further understand and agree that the arbitrator's decision
shall be final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by law and
enforceable by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

    25. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in more than one
        ------------
counterpart, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

    26. Changes to Agreement.  This Agreement may only be changed by another
        --------------------
written agreement signed by Executive and an authorized officer of the
Corporation.

    27. Construction.  In this Agreement unless a clear contrary intention
        ------------
appears, the singular number includes the plural and vice versa and reference to
any gender includes each other gender.

    28. Notices.  Any and all notices, demands or other communications required
        -------
or desired to be given hereunder by either party shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given when delivered personally or forty-eight (48) hours after

purchase/issuance, stock acceleration waiver, confidential/proprietary

each of you that the statements and representations stated herein as they relate
to Parent and Merger Sub are true, correct and complete in all respects at the
date hereof and will be true, correct and complete in all respects as of the
Effective Time (as if made as of the Effective Time):


     1.  The fair market value of Parent common stock ("Parent Stock"), Merger
Cash and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock received by holders
of Company Stock ("Shareholders") will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of Company common stock ("Company Stock") surrendered in the Merger.  In
connection with the Merger, no Shareholder will receive in exchange for Company
Stock, directly or indirectly, any

                                       1
<PAGE>

consideration from Parent other than Parent Stock, Merger Cash, and cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Stock.

     2.  Parent has no plan or intention:  (i) to liquidate Company; (ii) to
merge Company into another corporation; (iii) to sell or otherwise dispose of
any Company Stock acquired by Parent pursuant to the Agreement, except for
transfers and successive transfers to one or more corporations controlled in
each transfer by the transferor corporation (within the meaning of Section
368(c) of the Code) at the time of transfer; or (iv) to cause Company to sell or
otherwise dispose of any of its assets or of any of the assets of Merger Sub
acquired in the Merger, except for (w) dispositions made in the ordinary course
of business, (x) transfers and successive transfers to one or more corporations
controlled in each transfer by the transferor corporation (within the meaning of
Section 368(c) of the Code) at the time of transfer, (y) dispositions after
which Company would continue to hold the amount of assets set forth in paragraph
3 below following the Merger (assuming the correctness of the representation set
forth in paragraph 3 below), or (z) transfers to partnerships that satisfy the
provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B).

     3.  Assuming the correctness of the representation in paragraph 2 of the
Company Officer's Certificate, following the Merger, Company will hold at least
90 percent of the fair market value of Company's net assets and at least 70
percent of the fair market value of Company's gross assets and at least 90
percent of the fair market value of Merger Sub's net assets and at least 70
percent of Merger Sub's gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective
Time.  For purposes of the representation in the immediately preceding sentence,
amounts paid by Company or Merger Sub to dissenters, amounts paid by Company or
Merger Sub to Shareholders who receive cash or other property, and amounts used
by Company or Merger Sub to pay reorganization expenses will be included as
assets of Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be, immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

     4.  There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
Company or between Merger Sub and Company.

     5.  Merger Sub is a corporation newly formed for the purpose of
participating in the Merger and at no time prior to the Effective Time has had
assets (other than nominal assets contributed upon the formation of Merger Sub,
which assets will be held by Company following the Merger) or business
operations.

     6.  Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Company and will not
transfer to Company any assets subject to liabilities in the Merger.

     7.  Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in control of Merger Sub within the
meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.  Following the Merger, Parent will be in
control of Company within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

     8.  Parent has no plan or intention to cause Company, after the Effective
Time, to issue additional shares of stock that would result in Parent losing
control of Company within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     9.   Following the Merger, neither Parent nor any person related to Parent
within the meaning of Treas. Reg. (S)(S) 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) has
any plan or intention to purchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire any Parent
Stock issued pursuant to the Agreement.

     10.  There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
Company or between Merger Sub and Company that was issued, acquired, or will be
settled at a discount.

     11.  In the Merger, shares of Company Stock representing control of Company
(within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) will be exchanged solely for
"voting stock" of Parent (within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and (2)(E)
of the Code).  For purposes of this paragraph 10, Company Stock to be exchanged
for cash or other property originating with Parent is treated as constituting
outstanding Company Stock at the Effective Time.

     12.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub will pay their respective expenses, if
any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub
has agreed to assume, nor will either directly or indirectly assume, any expense
or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of Company or any holder of
Company Stock.  The Company Stock acquired by Parent in the Merger will not be
subject to any liabilities.

     13.  As of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any person related to
Parent within the meaning of Treas. Reg. (S)(S) 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5)
will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of
record, during the five years immediately prior to the Effective Time, any stock
of Company, or other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the
holder thereof the right to acquire Company Stock or other securities issued by
Company.

     14.  Following the Merger, Company or Parent (or a member or members of the
"qualified group," as defined in Treas. Reg. (S) 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), that
includes Parent as the "issuing corporation," as defined in Treas. Reg.
(S)1.368-1(b)), will continue the historic business of Company (or,
alternatively, if the Company has more than one line of business, will continue
at least one significant line of the Company's historic business) or use a
significant portion of Company's historic business assets in a business.

     15.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an "investment company" as defined in
Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

     16.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will directly or indirectly provide
funds to make payments in respect of Dissenting Shares.

     17.  Except for the Merger Cash and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Stock, 100 percent of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be exchanged for Parent Stock.  The issuance in the
Merger of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock represents a mere
mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration.  The total cash consideration that will
be paid pursuant to

                                       3
<PAGE>

the Agreement to Shareholders instead of issuing fractional Parent Stock will
not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued pursuant
to the Agreement to Shareholders in exchange for their Company Stock. The
fractional share interests of each Shareholder will be aggregated, and no
Shareholder will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of
one full share of Parent Stock on the Closing Date.

     18.  None of the compensation received by any stockholder-employees from
Parent or from the Company following the Merger will be separate consideration
for, or allocable to, any of their Company Stock.  None of the Parent Stock
received by any stockholder-employees will be given pursuant to any employment
agreement.  The compensation paid to any stockholder-employees by Parent or by
the Company following the Merger will be for services actually rendered and will
be commensurate with amounts that would be paid to third parties bargaining at
arm's-length for similar services.

     19.  Parent has a bona fide business reason for engaging in the Merger.

     20.  The terms of the Agreement and all other agreements entered into in
connection therewith are the product of arm's length negotiations.

     21.  The undersigned are authorized to make all of the representations set
forth herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July
17, 2000 (the "Agreement"), by and among Digital Island, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Ocean Acquisition Corp., a California corporation
("Merger Sub") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and SoftAware, Inc., a
California corporation ("Company"), which provides for the merger (the "Merger")
of Merger Sub with and into Company on the terms and conditions set forth
therein.  The time at which the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred
to as the "Effective Time."  Each of Latham & Watkins, counsel to Company, and
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to Parent, has been requested pursuant
to Section 6.2(c) and 6.3(o) of the Agreement, respectively, to render its
opinion regarding certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
Merger.  Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings specified in the
Agreement.

A.  Statements and Representations.
--  ------------------------------

          In connection with such opinion to be rendered by each of you, and
acknowledging that each of you will rely, with Company's consent, upon the
statements and representations made in this letter in rendering such opinion,
Company hereby certifies and represents to each of you that the statements and
representations stated herein as they relate to Company are true, correct and
complete in all respects at the date hereof and will be true, correct and
complete in all respects as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the
Effective Time).

1.  The fair market value of Parent common stock ("Parent Stock"), Merger Cash
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock received by holders of
Company Stock ("Shareholders") will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of Company common stock ("Company Stock") surrendered in the Merger.  In
connection with the Merger, no Shareholders will receive in exchange for Company
Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration from Parent other than Parent
Stock, Merger Cash and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock.

                                       1
<PAGE>

     2.  At the Effective Time, Company will hold at least 90 percent of the
fair market value of its net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market
value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Effective Time.  For
purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Company to dissenting
Shareholders, amounts used by Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid by
Company to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of Company as part of
any overall plan of which the Merger is part, and amounts distributed by Company
to Shareholders (except for any regular, normal dividends) as part of an overall
plan of which the Merger is a part, in each case will be treated as constituting
assets of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     3.  Each of Company and the Shareholders has paid and will pay only their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.  Company
has not agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense
or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any Shareholders.

     4.  There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
Company or between Merger Sub and Company.

     5.  Company has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of its
stock after the Effective Time that would result in Parent losing control of
Company within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.  At the Effective
Time, Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible
securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could
acquire stock in Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parent's
Merger Sub or retention of control of Company, as defined in Section 368(c) of
the Code.

     6.  Neither Company nor any person related to Company within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. (S)(S) 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4), and (e)(5), has purchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired, or made any extraordinary distributions (as defined in
Treas. Reg. (S)1.368-1T(e)(1)(ii)(A)) with respect to, any Company Stock prior
to or in contemplation of the Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of which
the Merger is a part.

     7.  Company is not an "investment company" as defined in Sections
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

     8.  Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

     9.  Except for the Merger Cash and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Stock, 100 percent of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be exchanged for Parent Stock.  The issuance in the
Merger of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock represents a mere
mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration.  The total cash consideration that will
be paid pursuant to the Agreement to the Shareholders as Merger Cash and instead
of issuing fractional Parent Stock will not exceed one percent of the total
consideration that will be issued pursuant to the Agreement to the Shareholders
in exchange for their Company Stock.  The fractional share

                                       2
<PAGE>

interests of each Shareholder will be aggregated, and no Shareholder will
receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share
of Parent Stock on the Closing Date.

     10.  None of the compensation received by any stockholder-employees of
Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their
Company Stock.  None of the Parent Stock received by any stockholder-employees
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement.
The compensation paid to any stockholder-employees will be for services actually
rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining
at arm's-length for similar services.

     11.  In the Merger, Company Stock representing control of Company (within
the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) will be exchanged solely for "voting
stock" of Parent (within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and (2)(E)).  For
purposes of this paragraph 11, Company Stock to be exchanged for cash or other
property originating with Parent is treated as constituting outstanding Company
Stock at the Effective Time.

     12.  The business currently carried on by Company is its "historic
business" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. (S) 1.368-1(d) and no assets of
Company have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of which would prevent
Company from continuing the "historic business" of Company or from using a
"significant portion" of Company's "historic business" assets in a business
following the Merger, as such terms are used in Treas. Reg. (S)1.368-1(d).

     13.  At the Effective Time, there will be no accrued but unpaid dividends
on Company Stock.

     14.  Payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be made
solely from the funds of Company.  No funds will be supplied for that purpose,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub, nor will Parent or Merger Sub
directly or indirectly reimburse Company for any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares.

     15.  At the Effective Time, the fair market value of Company's assets will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which the assets are subject.

     16.  Company has a bona fide business reason for engaging in the Merger.

     17.  The terms of the Agreement and all other agreements entered into in
connection therewith are the product of arm's length negotiations.

     18.  The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set
forth herein.

B.   Reliance by You in Rendering Opinion:  Limitations on Your Opinion.

you, (i) your tax opinion will be based on the statements and representations
set forth herein and on the statements contained in the Agreement and documents
related thereto, and (ii) your tax opinion

                                       3

will be subject to certain limitations and qualifications including that it may
not be relied upon if any such statements or representations are not accurate in
all respects.

          Company undertakes to inform each of you and Parent immediately should
any of the foregoing statements or representations become untrue, incorrect or
incomplete in any respect on or prior to the Effective Time.

                   INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION STOCK ACCELERATION
                              AMENDMENT AND WAIVER


     This Involuntary Termination Stock Acceleration Amendment and Waiver (the
"Amendment") relates to certain stock options and unvested shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock pursuant to the Corporation's 1999 Stock
Option/Issuance Plan and my stock option agreement and/or execution of the
Corporation's Stock Purchase Agreement.  An Addendum to the stock option
agreement and/or stock purchase agreement (the "Addendum") provided certain
rights in the case of an Involuntary Termination after a Corporate Transaction.
A copy of the Addenda are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference
as Exhibit "A". All capitalized terms in this Amendment shall have the meaning
assigned to them in this Amendment or the Corporation's 1999 Stock
Option/Issuance Plan.

     I, _______________________ am an employee of the Corporation and am the
holder of certain stock options and/or unvested shares and certain rights
pursuant to the Addenda.  I hereby acknowledge, for good and valuable
consideration received, to amend the Addenda, only with respect the definition
of Involuntary Termination, as follows:

     Delete: "(ii) Optionee's voluntary resignation following (A) a change in
his or her position with the Corporation (or Parent or Subsidiary employing
Optionee) which materially reduces his or her duties and responsibilities or the
level of management to which he or she reports, ..."

     And insert in its place: "(ii) Optionee's voluntary resignation following
(A) a material reduction in the fundamental nature and scope of the Optionee's
duties and responsibilities with the Corporation (or Parent or Subsidiary
thereof), although if any change or reduction in the nature and scope of
Optionee's duties and responsibilities is occasioned solely by reason of the
change in the status of Corporation from an independently operated entity to a
wholly-owned subsidiary or to post-merger entity with integrated operations
constitute grounds for a clause (A) Involuntary Termination, ...."

     I hereby acknowledge receipt of One Thousand dollars ($1,000.00) as good
and valuable consideration in exchange for my waiver of the existing definition,
and my agreement to the replacement for that portion of the definition, as set
forth above.

     I further agree and acknowledge that I have the right to consult separate
counsel of my own choosing, and at my own expense, to review and advise me with
reference to the Amendment.

     To indicate (i) my waiver of that portion of the existing definition, and
my agreement to the replacement for that portion of the definition, as set forth
above; (ii) my acknowledgement of good and valuable consideration in exchange
for the Amendment; and (iii) my exercise or waiver of separate counsel of my
choosing to review and advise me with reference to the Amendment, I agree to and
do sign and date this Amendment.

                                SOFTAWARE, INC.

                                  280G WAIVER


RECITALS
--------

          WHEREAS, the undersigned Executive has previously entered into a stock
purchase agreement, stock option agreement, purchase option agreement, addendum
to stock purchase agreement, addendum to stock option agreement, and/or any
amendment thereto (collectively, the "Agreements") with SoftAware, Inc. (the
"Company") pursuant to which Executive has purchased __________________ shares
of the Company's common stock and/or has the option to purchase _________ shares
of the Company's common stock ( collectively the "Shares").

          WHEREAS, the Company has agreed to be acquired by Digital Island, Inc.
("Parent") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization among Parent and
the Company (the "Merger").

          WHEREAS,  under the terms of the Agreements, all the Shares are to
immediately vest, and the Company's repurchase rights with respect to those
Shares are to lapse, upon Executive's termination without cause or involuntary
termination following the Merger.


          WHEREAS, both the Executive's initial acquisition of the Shares and
the accelerated vesting of those Shares upon Executive's termination without
cause or involuntary termination following the Merger could result in Executive
being deemed to have received a "parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 280G").

          WHEREAS, Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) provides that a payment will not be
deemed to be a parachute payment if Executive's right to receive or retain the
payment is contingent upon the approval of such payment by the Company's
shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 280G and the
applicable regulations thereunder.

          WHEREAS, the Company and Executive wish to amend the Agreements to
provide that Executive's right to retain and/or purchase the Shares pursuant to
the Agreements and the accelerated vesting of those Shares upon Executive's
termination without cause or involuntary termination following the Merger shall
be subject to shareholder approval in accordance with the provisions of Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) in order to prevent the loss of a tax deduction by the Company
and an imposition of an excise tax on Executive.

          NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:

          Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreements to the contrary,
Executive hereby waives any and all right or entitlement to (i) retain and/or
purchase the Shares under the Agreements, and (ii) have the Shares vest on an
accelerated basis upon Executive's termination
<PAGE>

without cause or involuntary termination following the Merger. Executive
accordingly agrees that the provisions of the Agreements pursuant to which the
Shares were issued to the Executive, the provisions of the Agreements pursuant
to which the shares are purchasable by the Executive and the provisions of the
Agreements pursuant to which the shares accelerate upon Executive's termination
without cause or involuntary termination following the Merger, to the extent
such provisions apply to the Shares, shall be null and void and without any
force or effect and that Executive shall have no right or entitlement to retain
and/or purchase the Shares under the Agreements and shall have no right or
entitlement to accelerated vesting upon Executive's termination without cause or
involuntary termination following the Merger, unless the Executive's initial
grant and/or acquisition of the Shares pursuant to the Agreements and the
accelerated vesting upon Executive's termination without cause or involuntary
termination following the Merger is approved by the shareholders of the Company
in accordance with the provisions of Section 280G and the regulations
thereunder. Accordingly, Executive shall not be entitled to retain and/or
purchase any of the Shares under the Agreements or receive any accelerated
vesting upon Executive's termination without cause or involuntary termination
following the Merger without such requisite shareholder approval.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this agreement as of
, 2000.
