of the Merger and without any action on the part of shareholders of the
Company or Merger Sub:

            (a)   Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) the Per Share Closing
Consideration and (ii) a pro rata portion based on the total number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Deferred Payments, any Earnout Payment
and any Receivables Payment (collectively, the "Future Payments;" the Per
Share Closing Consideration together with such pro rata portion of the

Corporation or any of their respective affiliates shall have any
liabilities or obligations with respect to the actual per share amount of
the Merger Consideration paid to any Person entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, which subject to the terms of this Agreement, shall be
determined solely by the Shareholders' Representative.

      (b)   Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Common Stock
owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation, and all such shares of Surviving
Corporation common stock shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time.

any, (iii) the amount of all outstanding consolidated indebtedness of the
Company as of the Effective Time, (iv) the aggregate amount of all

"Integration Cost Adjustment" shall mean an amount equal to $11,000,000.

            (d)   "Company Transaction Expenses" shall mean all fees, costs

            (f)   The "Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to $100,000,000 divided by the Parent Closing

adjustment as provided below.  For purposes of this Agreement, the "Parent
Closing Trading Price" means the average of the reported closing sale
prices per share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") as reported on the NYSE consolidated tape system for the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day prior to
the Effective Time.

            (g)   The number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting
the Stock Consideration is subject to adjustment as follows: if on the date
that is one (1) trading day prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement contemplated by Section 7.14(a) (the "Adjustment Date"), the
average of the reported closing sales prices per share of Parent Common
Stock on the NYSE as reported on the NYSE consolidated tape system for the
five (5) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the Adjustment
Date (the "Parent Adjustment Trading Price") (i) is greater than 110% of
the Parent Closing Trading Price, the Stock Consideration shall be a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to $110,000,000 divided by the
Parent Adjustment Trading Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
or (ii) is less than the Parent Closing Trading Price, the Stock
Consideration shall be a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
$100,000,000 divided by the Parent Adjustment Trading Price (rounded down
to the nearest whole share); provided, however, that in the event that that
Parent Adjustment Trading Price is less than 75% of the Parent Closing
Trading Price (the "Floor Price"), the Parent Adjustment Trading Price for
purposes of this clause (ii) shall be equal to the Floor Price.  Parent may
elect to reduce all or any portion of the increase in number of shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise required by Section 3.3(g)(ii) by paying, in
lieu of such increase, an amount in cash equal to the Parent Adjustment
Trading Price for each share  (any such cash so paid, shall be deemed part
of the Stock Consideration).   On the Adjustment Date, Parent shall deliver
a statement to the Shareholders' Representative and the Exchange Agent
specifying the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the
Stock Consideration as determined in accordance with Sections 3.2(f) and
(g).

            (h)   The "Per Share Closing Consideration" shall mean:

                  (i)   with respect to each Non-Election Share, an amount
      payable in cash from the Cash Closing Consideration equal to a pro
      rata portion (based on the number of shares of Common Stock
      outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on a
      Fully-Diluted Basis) of the Closing Consideration Amount; and

                  (ii) with respect to each Election Share, (A) an amount
      payable in cash equal to a pro rata portion (based on the total
      number of Election Shares) of the remaining portion of the Cash
      Closing Consideration, if any, after payment from the Cash Closing
      Consideration with respect to Non-Election Shares as provided above
      and (B) an amount payable in Parent Common Stock equal to a pro rata
      portion (based on the total number of Election Shares) of the Stock
      Consideration.


      SECTION 3.3  POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT/ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

            (a)   During the period (the "Collection Period") commencing
with the Closing Date and ending on the last day of Parent's fiscal quarter
ending immediately prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Last Fiscal Quarter"), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the accounts
receivable of the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Accounts
Receivable") consistent with Parent's practices for collection of its
accounts receivable.  Any payment received by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (i) at any time after the Closing and (ii) from a customer of
the Company after the Closing who was also a customer of the Company prior
to the Closing, shall be presumptively applied to the accounts receivable
which such customer specified in such payment; provided, however, that if
no amount is so specified, Parent shall inquire of such customer as to
which accounts receivable such amount is to be applied and such amount
shall be applied in accordance with such instructions.   Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to refer any of the Closing
Accounts Receivable to a collection agency or to an attorney for
collection.  Parent shall incur no liability for any collected (other than




                                      5


<PAGE>


to comply with the provisions of this Section 3.3) or uncollected Closing
Accounts Receivable; provided, however, that upon the written request of
the Shareholders' Representative, Parent shall cause any uncollected
Closing Accounts Receivable with respect to which the Surviving Corporation
determines not to collect in accordance with the Company's practices for
collection of its accounts receivable prior to the Effective Time to be
assigned (without recourse) to Shareholders' Representative's designee,
unless Parent agrees to treat such Closing Accounts Receivable as having
been collected pursuant to this Section 3.3.  Following such assignment,
the Shareholders' Representative (or its designee) shall be solely
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
collection of such accounts receivable, and Parent shall have no
liabilities or obligations with respect thereto.

            (b)   On the date that is 75 days after the Closing Date,
Parent (with preparation assistance by Shareholders' Representative's
designee) shall deliver to the Shareholders' Representative (i) a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Effective Time (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall be prepared in good faith and in
conformity with GAAP and shall include separate schedules setting forth (A)
all Closing Accounts Receivable included on such balance sheet, (B)
Included Other Assets reflected on such balance sheet and (C) all
liabilities reflected on such balance sheet, including "deferred tax
liabilities" (the "Closing Date Liabilities") and (ii) a certificate
executed by an officer of Parent certifying that the Closing Balance Sheet
was prepared in accordance with clause (i) above.  "Included Other Assets"
shall mean the sum of the items included on the Closing Balance Sheet in
the captions "prepaid expenses," "deposits" and "deferred tax assets"
provided that such assets shall only be "Included Other Assets" to the
extent Parent has been provided supporting documentation for such assets,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

            (c)   On the date that is 75 days after the Closing Date (the
period between such date and the Closing Date the "First Receivables
True-Up Period") and as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar
days, following the end of each subsequent calendar month thereafter for
the first 12 months after the Closing and thereafter at the end of each of
Parent's fiscal quarters up to and including the Last Fiscal Quarter (each,
a "Subsequent Receivables True-Up Period" and, together with the First
Receivables True-Up Period, the "Receivables True-Up Periods"), Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders' Representative a statement
(the "Receivables Statement") setting forth for the applicable Receivables
True-Up Period all amounts received with respect to the Closing Accounts
Receivable during such Receivables True-Up Period (the "Collected Accounts
Receivable").

            (d)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent shall make any Receivables Payments in the following amounts and on
the following terms:

                  (i) if, based on the amounts set forth on the Closing
      Balance Sheet and the Receivables Statement with respect to First
      Receivables True-Up Period, the (A) sum of (1) the Collected Accounts
      Receivable for such period, if any, (2) the Included Other Assets, if
      any, (3) the Closing Cash True-Up, if any, and (4) the Closing
      Adjustment Amount, if any, exceeds (B) the Closing Date Liabilities,
      then

                        (1)   with respect to the First Receivables True-Up
      Period, the amount of such excess, subject to Section 10.4, shall be
      payable, subject to Section 10.4, no later than five (5) business
      days following delivery of the Receivables Statement for the First
      Receivables True-Up Period; and







                                      6


<PAGE>


                        (2)   with respect to each Subsequent Receivables
      True-Up Period, an amount, subject to Section 10.4, equal to the
      Collected Accounts Receivable during such period shall be payable,
      subject to Section 10.4, no later than five (5) business days
      following delivery of the Receivables Statement for such Subsequent
      Receivables True-Up Period;

                  (ii)  if, based on the amounts set forth on the Closing
      Balance Sheet and the Receivables Statement with respect to the First
      Receivables True-Up Period, the (A) the Closing Date Liabilities
      exceed (B) the sum of (1) Collected Accounts Receivable for such
      period, if any, (2) the Included Other Assets, if any, (3) the
      Closing Cash True-Up, if any, and (4) the Closing Adjustment Amount,
      if any (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as
      the "Receivables Shortfall"), then no payment shall be required in
      connection with the Collected Accounts Receivable for such period or
      any Subsequent Receivables True-up Period, unless and until, the
      aggregate amount of Collected Accounts Receivable for all Subsequent
      Receivables True-Up Periods exceeds the Receivables Shortfall, after
      which the amount of any such Collected Accounts Receivable in excess
      of the Receivables Shortfall, subject to Section 10.4, shall be
      payable, subject to Section 10.4, no later than five (5) business
      days following delivery of the Receivables Statement for the
      Subsequent Receivables True-Up Period that first reflects such excess
      and any Subsequent Receivables True-Up Period thereafter during the
      Collection Period; provided, however, in the event that, as of the
      end of the Receivables True-Up Period ending immediately prior to the
      payment date of any Future Payment (the "Offset True-Up Period"), the
      Receivables Shortfall exceeds the aggregate amount of Collected
      Accounts Receivable for all Receivables True-Up Periods as of the
      last day of the Offset True-Up Period, Parent shall be entitled to
      withhold and set-off the amount of such excess against such Future
      Payment; provided further, that (A) if the Receivables Shortfall is
      fully offset by such Future Payment, then, with respect to each
      Subsequent Receivables True-Up Period following the Offset True-Up
      Period, an amount, subject to Section 10.4, equal to the Collected
      Accounts Receivable during such period shall be payable, subject to
      Section 10.4, no later than five (5) business days following delivery
      of the Receivables Statement for such Subsequent Receivables True-Up
      Period; and (B) if the Receivables Shortfall is not fully offset by
      such Future Payment, then the unpaid amounts shall be deemed to be
      the Receivables Shortfall subject to this Section 3.3(d)(ii). If as
      of the Last Fiscal Quarter, a Closing Account Receivable has not been
      collected and a commission associated with such Closing Account
      Receivable was reflected as a Closing Date Liability on the Closing
      Balance Sheet, the final Receivables Payment shall be increased by
      the amount of such commission, but only to the extent such commission
      has not been paid and neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has
      any liability or obligation for such commission; and

                  (iii) an amount, subject to Section 10.4, equal to the
      consolidated cash, cash equivalents and deposits in transit of the
      Company, if any (net of any outstanding checks and other instruments
      issued but not drawn) as of the Effective Time, such amount to be
      paid as soon as practicable after Parent and the Company determine
      such amount.

Any of the foregoing payments are hereinafter referred to as the
"Receivables Payment."











                                      7


<PAGE>


            (e)   "Closing Cash True-Up" shall mean the amount, if any,
equal to the aggregate amount of all payments received by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary prior to July 2, 2008 or, in the event the Closing
occurs on August 31, 2008, prior to August 31, 2008, in connection with
revenues which are not recognizable under GAAP until after the applicable
date; it being understood that such Closing Cash True-Up may only be a
negative number (with Parent's calculation of such amount subject to the
procedures in Section 3.3(f)).

            (f)   After receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Shareholders' Representative shall have 60 days to review the Closing
Balance Sheet.  Parent shall give the Shareholders' Representative and its
agents and representatives (including accountants) full access to all
relevant books and records (excluding any materials prepared in connection
with any dispute or potential dispute regarding the Closing Balance Sheet)
and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries and Parent's accountants and
work papers to the extent required to complete its review of the Closing
Balance Sheet (provided that the obligation to provide access to, and to
produce work papers of, accountants is limited to commercially reasonable
efforts and subject to the Shareholders' Representative providing such
indemnification and other documentation as such accountants may request).
Unless the Shareholders' Representative delivers written notice to Parent
on or prior to the 45th day after the Shareholders' Representative's
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet specifying in reasonable detail all
disputed items and the basis therefor, the Shareholders' Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing Balance Sheet.
If the Shareholders' Representative so notifies Parent of the Shareholders'
Representative's objection to the Closing Balance Sheet, Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative shall, within 45 days following the date of
such notice (the "Balance Sheet Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve
their differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts
shall be final, binding and conclusive.  If at the conclusion of the
Balance Sheet Resolution Period, there are amounts remaining in dispute,
then such amounts shall be submitted to Grant Thornton LLP or such other
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative (the "Neutral Auditor").  Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Neutral
Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter.  All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be the
responsibility of the non-prevailing party. If the Shareholders'
Representative is the non-prevailing party, then such fees and expenses
shall be deemed Established Losses for purposes of this Agreement.  The
Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on
presentations by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative, and not by
independent review, only those amounts still in dispute.  The Neutral
Auditor's determination shall be made within 30 days of its engagement,
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative and shall be final, binding and conclusive.
If any amounts are referred to the Neutral Auditor, the term "Closing
Balance Sheet," as used in this Agreement, shall mean the definitive
Closing Balance Sheet resulting from the determinations made by the Neutral
Auditor in accordance with this section (in addition to those items
theretofore agreed to by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative) and
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the calculations in this Section
3.3 to reflect any differences between the definitive Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Parent in accordance with
Section 3.3(b), with any amounts to be paid by Parent to be added to the
next Receivables Payment together with a notional amount equal to interest
on such amount at the interest rate applicable to revolving borrowings
under the Credit Agreement (the "Agreed Rate") for the period beginning on
the 75th day after the Closing Date and ending on the date such amount is
paid with such Receivables Payment.

      SECTION 3.4  INTEGRATION COSTS.

            (a)   As soon as practicable following the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Shareholders'
Representative a statement (the "Integration Costs Statement"), certified
by an officer of Parent, setting forth the Integration Costs incurred prior
to the second anniversary of the Closing Date and any Integration Costs
budgeted by Parent in good faith in accordance with its normal budgeting
process for incurrence following such date (collectively, the "Incurred and
Budgeted Integration Costs").  If, as reflected on the Integration Costs
Statement, 50% of the Incurred and Budgeted Integration Costs, subject to
the limitations in Section 3.4(b) below, is less than $11,000,000, then
such difference shall be the "Integration Costs Refund," which amount shall
increase the First Deferred Payment in accordance with Section 3.5(a).

            (b)   "Integration Costs" means all costs related to (i) the
integration of the Company's and Parent's respective businesses following
the Closing (or prior to the Closing with Parent's written consent) that
would not have been incurred but for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including stay bonuses and severance payments for the
Company's legacy employees, information technology costs and occupancy
changes and (ii) the retention of Parent's legacy revenue professionals in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby ("Parent Retention
Costs"), with all such Integration Costs to be borne equally by Parent, on
the one hand, and the former holders of the Shares, on the other hand;
provided that in no event shall the obligation of the former holders of the
Shares exceed $11,000,000 in the aggregate; provided further, that in no
event shall the former holders of the Shares be obligated for any Parent
Retention Costs in excess of $2,125,000 in the aggregate.

      SECTION 3.5  DEFERRED PAYMENTS.

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall
make the Deferred Payments in the following amounts and on the following
terms:

      (a)   The First Deferred Payment shall be payable, subject to
Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, on the first business day of the 25th month
following the Closing Date; provided, however, if the Tenant Rep Business
Revenues for the 12 months ending one month prior to the 25th month
following the Closing Date are less than the Tenant Rep Base Revenue, then
such payment shall be payable, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, on
the first business day of the 37th month following the Closing Date.  The
"First Deferred Payment" means, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, an
amount in cash equal to $77,942,500 plus the Integration Cost Refund, if
any.

      (b)   The Second Deferred Payment shall be payable, subject to
Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, on the first business day of the 37th month
following the Closing Date; provided, however, if the Tenant Rep Business
Revenues for the 12 months ending one month prior to the 37th month
following the Closing Date are less than the Tenant Rep Base Revenue, then
such payment shall be payable, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, on
the first business day of the 49th month following the Closing Date. The
"Second Deferred Payment" means, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4,
an amount in cash equal to $155,885,000.

      (c)   The Third Deferred Payment shall be payable, subject to
Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, on the first business day of the 61st month
following the Closing Date.  The "Third Deferred Payment" means, subject to
Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, an amount in cash equal to $155,885,000.

      The First Deferred Payment, Second Deferred Payment and Third
Deferred Payment are hereinafter referred to as the "Deferred Payments."
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay when due any non-disputed
amount of the Deferred Payments when due as set forth above.

      (d)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any
default under Parent's Amended and Restated Multicurrency Credit Agreement
dated June 6, 2007 (or any credit agreement or other financing or
refinancing which replaces such credit agreement, in each case as the same
may be amended, supplemented, restated or modified from time to time in
compliance with this Agreement, the "Credit Agreement") which results in
the acceleration of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement
prior to its express maturity, any remaining Deferred Payments shall
become, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, immediately due and
payable.

      (e)   If Parent fails to pay all or any portion of a Deferred Payment
when due hereunder in breach of this Agreement, (i) the amount not so paid
shall bear interest at the applicable "default rate" set forth in the
Credit Agreement for the period beginning on the date such amount was due
and payable and ending on the date such amount is paid and (ii) if such
Deferred Payment (together with accrued interest) is not paid in full on or
before the 270th day following the payment due date (or on or before the
135th day if there has been a prior Deferred Payment payment default which
was cured within the time period specified herein; or on or before the
180th day if the remaining Deferred Payment obligations have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 3.5(l), below), then (A) the
non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained in any employment
or independent contractor agreement or other agreement or arrangement
entered into in connection with this Agreement between Parent (or one of
its Subsidiaries) and a shareholder of the Company who is a shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate upon the
termination of the employee or independent contractor party to such
agreement, (B) the Name Assignment and License Agreement shall immediately
terminate and be of no further force or effect and (C) Section 3.12 shall
immediately terminate and be of no further effect with any payments
theretofore delayed pursuant to Section 3.12 to be paid within five (5)
business days after the termination of the applicable cure period.  For the
avoidance of doubt, any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
10.4(h), including in connection with a Withheld Amount related to a
Deferred Payment, shall not be due and payable except to the extent
provided in Section 10.4(h), and Section 10.4(h) shall govern any interest
payment required to be paid in connection with such payment.

      (f)   If, by June 1, 2012, the final maturity of the loans under the
Credit Agreement has not been extended (including through a refinancing) to
a date not earlier than the first business day of the 61st month following
the Closing Date, then any remaining Deferred Payments shall become,
subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, due and payable on June 2, 2012.
The Credit Agreement shall not be amended or otherwise modified to change
the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder to a date prior to June 6, 2012
after the Closing Date.

      (g)   The Credit Agreement shall not, without the consent of the
Shareholders' Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), be amended or otherwise modified to (i) permit a Total Funded
Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) greater
than 3.75 to 1.00 or (ii) permit an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) less than 1.750 to 1.0.  However, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, but subject to Section 3.5(h)
below, Parent may make any of the modifications to the Credit Agreement
described in this Section 3.5(g) in order to cure or avoid an event of
default under the Credit Agreement so long as Parent shall pay to the
Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the former shareholders of the
Company a proportionate amount of any waiver fees, incremental interest or
other compensation paid to lenders under the Credit Agreement in connection
with such amendment or waiver.  Such waiver fees, incremental interest and
other compensation paid to the Shareholders' Representative shall be deemed
proportionate if the amount paid to such lenders is multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of remaining
Deferred Payments and the denominator of which is the total of the
outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments under the Credit Agreement.

Nothing in this Agreement prohibits any prepayment of indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement.

                                     10


<PAGE>


      (h)   The Credit Agreement shall not, without the consent of the
Shareholders' Representative (to be granted or withheld in its sole
discretion), be amended or otherwise modified to (i) permit a Total Funded
Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) greater
than 4.75 to 1.00 or (ii) permit an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) less than 1.3750 to 1.0 or (iii) permit Consolidated
Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) less than the sum of
$700,000,000 plus an amount equal to 50% of the cumulative positive
Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) earned in 2009
and any subsequent fiscal year completed thereafter (but without
subtraction for any negative Consolidated Net Income for any such fiscal
year).

      (i)   The Credit Agreement shall not, without the consent of the
Shareholders' Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), be amended or otherwise modified to change the definition of
the terms "Total Funded Debt," "Adjusted EBITDA Ratio," "Interest Coverage
Ratio" or "Consolidated Net Worth" (or any of the terms used in the
definitions of such terms) if such change has a material adverse effect on
the Parent's ability to pay the Deferred Payments as they come due.
However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Parent
may make any of the amendments or modifications to the Credit Agreement
described in this Section 3.5(i) in connection with the amendment or
refinancing of the Credit Agreement in 2008.  For all purposes of this
Agreement, (i) references to certain terms "as defined in the Credit
Agreement" shall mean such terms as defined in the Credit Agreement
excluding, and without giving effect to, the impact of non-cash or
non-recurring items and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall restrict
Parent's ability to amend or modify any provision of the Credit Agreement
to exclude the impact of non-cash or non-recurring items.

      (j)   Parent shall not voluntarily reduce or terminate revolving
commitments under the Credit Agreement (other than in connection with a
refinancing or replacement thereof in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.5) unless the board of directors of Parent shall have
reasonably determined in good faith that adequate liquidity will be
available (including by virtue of access to debt and/or equity markets) to
satisfy all remaining Deferred Payments and Earnout Payments without such
revolving commitments.

      (k)   If a Bankruptcy Default occurs, then any remaining Deferred
Payments shall become, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, immediately
due and payable.  For purposes of the foregoing, "Bankruptcy Default" means
(x) the Parent or any Subsidiary thereof shall (i) have entered
involuntarily against it an order for relief under the United States
Bankruptcy Code, as amended, or any analogous action is taken under any
other applicable law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) fail to
pay, or admit in writing its inability to pay, its debts generally as they
become due, (iii) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv)
apply for, seek, consent to, or acquiesce in, the appointment of a
receiver, custodian, trustee, examiner, liquidator or similar official for
it or any substantial part of its property, (v) institute any proceeding
seeking to have entered against it an order for relief under the United
States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, to adjudicate it insolvent, or seeking
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors or fail
within the time allowed therefor to file an answer or other pleading
denying the material allegations of any such proceeding filed against it,
(vi) take any corporate action (such as the passage by the board of
directors of a resolution) in furtherance of any matter described in parts
(i)-(v) above, or (vii) fail to contest in good faith any appointment or
proceeding described in the following clause (y), or (y) a custodian,
receiver, trustee, examiner, liquidator or similar official shall be
appointed for the Parent or any Subsidiary thereof or any substantial part
of any of their property, taken as a whole, or a proceeding described in
the foregoing clause (x) shall be instituted against the Parent or any
Subsidiary thereof, and such appointment continues undischarged or such
proceeding continues undismissed or unstayed for a period of sixty (60)
days.

      (l)   If any Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement,
other than a Bankruptcy Default) occurs under the Credit Agreement and is
not cured or waived (including by virtue of a modification or refinancing
of the Credit Agreement) on or before the 180th day following the earlier
of the date that Parent is notified or otherwise becomes, or reasonably
should be, aware of such Event of Default, then any remaining Deferred
Payments shall become, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, immediately
due and payable.  Parent shall notify the Shareholders' Representative of
an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement promptly after Parent is
notified or otherwise becomes aware of such Event of Default.

      (m)   If collateral is granted as security for obligations under the
Credit Agreement, Parent shall make or cause to be made effective provision
whereby the remaining Deferred Payments will be secured by such lien, or a
lien of equal priority on the same collateral, equally and ratably with
such indebtedness under the Credit Agreement as long as any such Credit
Agreement indebtedness shall be so secured, it being agreed, however, that
all decisions relating to such lien, including the decision to release or
subordinate such lien, and the decision to foreclose or pursue other
remedies with respect to such lien, shall be reserved to the lenders under
the Credit Agreement and/or their collateral agent (to be made by them in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement), and that the payees of
the remaining Deferred Payments shall have no rights to direct such
decisions.

      (n)   If any Person shall guarantee obligations under the Credit
Agreement, Parent shall make or cause to be made effective provision
whereby the remaining Deferred Payments will be guaranteed by such Person,
equally and ratably with such indebtedness under the Credit Agreement as
long as any such Credit Agreement indebtedness shall be so guaranteed, it
being agreed, however, that all decisions relating to such guarantee,
including the decision to release or subordinate such guarantee, and the
decision to pursue remedies with respect to such guarantee, shall be
reserved to the lenders under the Credit Agreement and/or their collateral
agent (to be made by them in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement), and that the payees of the remaining Deferred Payments shall
have no rights to direct such decisions.

      (o)   If an Adverse Change of Control occurs, then any remaining
Deferred Payments shall, upon written notice delivered by the Shareholders'
Representative to Parent within 90 days after such Adverse Change of
Control, become, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, immediately due
and payable.  For purposes of the foregoing, an "Adverse Change of Control"
shall be deemed to occur if both (i) any Person or "group" (within the
meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) shall have
acquired beneficial ownership of more than 50% on a fully diluted basis of
the voting interest in Parent and (ii) in connection with (and within 90
days after) the event described in clause (i), the Parent's corporate debt
ratings issued by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's
Ratings Group, Inc. are reduced to levels below both (A) the respective
ratings of such agencies in effect immediately after the Closing Date and
(B) the respective ratings of such agencies in effect immediately prior to
the event described in clause (i).

      SECTION 3.6  EARNOUT PAYMENTS.

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall
make the Earnout Payments in the following amounts and on the following
terms:

            (a)   Earnout Payments, if any, are payable as follows:

                  (i)   The Earnout Payment, if any, for the Earnout
      Calculation Period ending December 31, 2010 shall be paid in two
      equal installments, with (A) the first such installment to be paid,
      subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, as soon as practicable
      following the date on which Parent's audited financial statements for
      the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 are available; provided that
      in the event such first installment is not paid by March 15, 2011,
      such amounts shall accrue interest at the Agreed Rate from such date
      until the date such first installment is paid and (B) the second
      installment to be paid, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, not
      later than January 2, 2012; and

                  (ii)  The Earnout Payment, if any, for any subsequent
      Earnout Calculation Period shall be paid, subject to Sections
      3.3(d)(ii) and 10.4, as soon as practicable following the date on
      which Parent's audited financial statements for the fiscal year
      ending as of the end of each applicable earnout calculation period
      are available, but in no event later than 30 days thereafter.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Earnout Date
      Adjustment, any Earnout Payment shall not be due and payable until 75
      days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable
      Earnout Calculation Period ended as a result of such Earnout Date
      Adjustment (and no interest shall be due with respect thereto in the
      case of Section 3.6(a)(i)(A) until such date).

      If Parent fails to pay all or any portion of an Earnout Payment when
      due hereunder in breach of this Agreement, the amount not so paid
      shall bear interest at the Agreed Rate for the period beginning on
      the date such amount was due and payable and ending on the date such
      amount is paid.  For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any payment required
      to be made pursuant to Section 10.4(h), including in connection with
      a Withheld Amount related to an Earnout Payment, shall not be due and
      payable except to the extent provided in Section 10.4(h), and Section
      10.4(h) shall govern any interest payment required to be paid in
      connection with such payment and (ii) any payments required to be
      made pursuant to 3.7(c) shall not be due and payable except to the
      extent provided in Section 3.7(c), and Section 3.7(c) shall govern
      any interest payment required to be paid in connection with such
      payment.  For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay when due any
      non-disputed amount of the Earnout Payment when due as set forth in
      Section 3.6(a).

            (b)   "Earnout Payment" means, subject to Sections 3.3(d)(ii)
and 10.4, for any Earnout Calculation Period, an amount in cash, if any,
equal to (A) (x) $113,850,000 multiplied by (y) a fraction (which in no
event shall be greater than 1.0 or less than 0.0) equal to (1) the
numerator of which is the Tenant Rep Business Revenue for such Earnout
Calculation Period as set forth on the Earnout Statement for such period
minus the Minimum Tenant Rep Business Revenue for such Earnout Calculation
Period and (2) the denominator of which is the Target Tenant Rep Business
Revenue for such Earnout Calculation Period minus the Minimum Tenant Rep
Business Revenue for such Earnout Calculation Period minus (in the case of
any Earnout Calculation Period ended December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2012
(as such dates may be extended as a result of an Earnout Date Adjustment))
(B) the aggregate Earnout Payments earned (without giving effect to any
reduction in the amount actually paid with respect thereto in accordance
with Sections 3.3(d)(ii) or 10.4)), if any, in prior Earnout Calculation
Periods, calculated as set forth in Section 3.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.


                                     13


<PAGE>


            (c)   During any Earnout Calculation Period, without the prior
written consent of the Shareholders' Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, solicit to hire or engage, or hire or
engage, any employee or independent contactor of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time listed on Section
8.3(i)(i) or (ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or who otherwise
generates revenue from client engagements in the Tenant Rep Business
("Company Employees and Contractors").  For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not in any way limit Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries'
internal or external communications regarding employment or independent
contractor opportunities as long as such communications are not
specifically targeted at Company Employees and Contractors.  For purposes
of this Section 3.6(c), it is agreed and understood that the Shareholders'
Representative shall have reasonable grounds to withhold consent if the
employment or engagement of the subject person by Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent for a position with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is not a
revenue generating position for the Tenant Rep Business would reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the achievement of the Earnout Payments.

            (d)   If (i) employees or independent contactors of Jones Lang
LaSalle Americas, Inc. or its Subsidiaries who generate revenue from client
engagements relating to the Tenant Rep Business as of the Effective Time
move after the Effective Time to positions with Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries not related to the Tenant Rep Business and (ii) the revenues
lost from such persons has a material adverse impact on the achievement of
the Earnout Payments, upon the written request of the Shareholders'
Representative, the Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall discuss
in good faith equitable adjustments, if any, to the Earnout Payment targets
and/or minimums resulting from such lost revenue.

            (e)   If Parent sells all or a substantial portion of its
project development services or corporate capital markets businesses or
eliminates or makes other material adverse changes to its global delivery
platform during any Earnout Calculation Period, upon the written request of
the Shareholders' Representative, Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative shall discuss in good faith equitable adjustments, if any,
to the Earnout Payment targets and/or minimums resulting from such sale,
elimination or change.  If the Shareholders' Representative and Parent are
unable to agree on the appropriate equitable adjustments, if any, to the
Earnout Payment targets and/or minimums within 45 days of delivery of the
Shareholders' Representative's written notice contemplated by the preceding
sentence, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration using the
same procedures specified in Section 10.4(e).

      SECTION 3.7  EARNOUT STATEMENT.

            (a)   As soon as practicable following the date upon which
Parent's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending as of the
end of each applicable earnout calculation period are available, but in no
event later than 30 days thereafter (or in the event of an Earnout Date
Adjustment, within 75 days after the end of the calendar month in which the
applicable Earnout Calculation Period ended as a result of such Earnout
Date Adjustment), Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders'
Representative a written statement setting forth the calculations set forth
in Section 3.6 (the "Earnout Statement").














                                     14


<PAGE>


            (b)   After receipt of the Earnout Statement, the Shareholders'
Representative shall have 60 days to review the Earnout Statement.  Parent
shall give the Shareholders' Representative and its agents and
representatives (including accountants) full access to all relevant books
and records (excluding any materials prepared in connection with any
dispute or potential dispute regarding the Earnout Statement) and employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries and Parent's accountants and work papers to
the extent required to complete its review of the Earnout Statement
(provided that the obligation to provide access to, and to produce work
papers of, accountants is limited to commercially reasonable efforts and
subject to the Shareholders' Representative providing such indemnification
and other documentation as such accountants may request).  Unless the
Shareholders' Representative delivers written notice to Parent on or prior
to the 45th day after the Shareholders' Representative's receipt of the
Earnout Statement specifying in reasonable detail all disputed items and
the basis therefor, the Shareholders' Representative shall be deemed to
have accepted and agreed to the Earnout Statement.  If the Shareholders'
Representative so notifies Parent of the Shareholders' Representative's
objection to the Earnout Statement, Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative shall, within 45 days following the date of such notice (the
"Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve their differences and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

            (c)   If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are
amounts remaining in dispute, then such amounts shall be submitted to the
Neutral Auditor.  Parent and the Shareholders' Representative agree to
execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement
letter.  All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be the responsibility of the
non-prevailing party. If the Shareholders' Representative is the
non-prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be deemed
Established Losses for purposes of this Agreement.  The Neutral Auditor
shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by
Parent and the Shareholders' Representative, and not by independent review,
only those amounts still in dispute.  The Neutral Auditor's determination
shall be made within 30 days of its engagement, shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Parent and the Shareholders' Representative
and shall be final, binding and conclusive.  If any amounts are referred to
the Neutral Auditor, the term "Earnout Statement" as used in this
Agreement, shall mean the definitive Earnout Statement resulting from the
determinations made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this section
(in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative) and appropriate adjustments shall be made to
the calculations in Section 3.6 to reflect any differences between the
definitive Earnout Statement and the Earnout Statement delivered by Parent
in accordance with 3.7(a), with any amounts to be paid by Parent to be as
follows:

                  (i)   with respect to the Earnout Payment for the earnout
      calculation period ending December 31, 2010 (as such date may be
      extended as a result of an Earnout Date Adjustment), (A) 50% of such
      amounts shall be paid as soon as practicable, but in no event later
      than five (5) business days, after the determination of the
      definitive Earnout Statement with respect to such earnout calculation
      period, together with a notional amount equal to interest on such
      amount at the Agreed Rate for the period beginning the date Parent
      delivered the Earnout Statement for such period to the Shareholders'
      Representative and ending on the date of payment pursuant to this
      Section 3.7(c)(i) and (B) the payment made pursuant to Section
      3.6(a)(i)(B) shall be calculated based upon the definitive Earnout
      Statement; and








                                     15


<PAGE>


                  (ii)  with respect to the Earnout Payments for any
      subsequent earnout calculation periods, such amounts shall be paid as
      soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) business
      days, after the determination of the definitive Earnout Statement
      with respect to the applicable earnout calculation period, together
      with a notional amount equal to interest on such amount at the Agreed
      Rate for the period beginning the date Parent delivered the Earnout
      Statement for such period to the Shareholders' Representative and
      ending on from the date of payment made pursuant to Section
      3.6(a)(ii).

            (d)   With respect the determination of Tenant Rep Business
Revenues solely for purposes of fixing the payment date for the First
Deferred Payment and the Second Deferred Payment, in each case as set forth
in the provisos of the first sentence of each of Sections 3.5(a) and
3.5(b), respectively, Parent shall provide the Shareholders' Representative
and its agents and representatives (including accountants) access as
described in Section 3.7(b).  The Shareholders' Representative shall have
the right to submit any dispute with respect to such determination of date
of the First Deferred Payment and Second Deferred Payment to a Neutral
Arbitrator in the manner described in Section 3.7(c) and Parent's
obligation to make any such payments shall be deferred pending resolution
of such dispute.

      SECTION 3.8  APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

            (a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not consented thereto in
writing and who has otherwise taken all of the steps required by
Subsection 10.356 of the TBOC to properly exercise and perfect such
shareholder's dissenter's rights (any such shares being referred to herein
as "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set
forth in Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC; provided, however, that in
the event that a shareholder of the Company fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the TBOC, the shares of
Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, with any such holder's
Per Share Closing Consideration to be paid by Parent from the Dissenters
Holdback (to the extent taken into account in the calculation of the
Closing Consideration Amount).

            (b)   The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the TBOC and received by the
Company relating to rights of appraisal.  Prior to Closing, the Company,
and following Closing, the Shareholders' Representative shall have the
right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the TBOC; provided that Parent shall have the right to
participate in such negotiations and proceedings and the Shareholders'
Representative shall retain legal counsel in connection with such
negotiations and proceedings, at the sole cost and expense of the former
shareholders of the Company, reasonably satisfactory to Parent.  The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any demands for
appraisal.












                                     16

      SECTION 3.9  SHAREHOLDER ELECTION.  As soon as practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall mail to each holder of Shares as of the
date hereof (who has not heretofore received and completed such materials)
(i) the Parent information packet made available to the Company by Parent,
(ii) the Information Statement and (iii) the Shareholder Waiver, Agreement,
Representation and Election Form in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B (a "Shareholder Election Form and Agreement").  Each
Shareholder who submits to the Company an effective, properly completed
Shareholder Election Form and Agreement which is actually received by the
Company by 5:00 p.m., central time, on June 25, 2008  (or such later date
determined by the Company (not to be later than two (2) business days prior
to the Closing Date) with Parent's consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed)  is referred to herein as
an "Electing Holder."  The Shareholder Election Form and Agreement shall,
among other things, (i) contain each Electing Holder's (A) waiver of the
rights and remedies set forth in Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC, (B)
representation that it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Regulation D under the Securities Act and other covenants, agreements and
acknowledgements related to compliance with Regulation D, (C) agreement to
be bound by covenants and agreements equivalent to those set forth in
Section 7.13 and (D) agreement to be bound by the covenants and agreements
set forth in Section 7.14 and (ii) permit each Electing Holder to
irrevocably specify the number of such holder's Shares with respect to
which such holder elects to receive all or any portion of the Per Share
Closing Consideration in shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Election
Shares").  Any Common Stock or other right to receive the Merger
Consideration that is not an Election Share is a "Non-Election Share."
Promptly upon receipt of each Shareholder Election Form and Agreement, the
Company shall deliver a copy of same to Parent.  All questions as to the
timely receipt, effectiveness and proper completion of Shareholder Election
Forms and Agreements will be determined by Parent.  None of Parent, the
Company or any other Person shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Shareholder Election Form and Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent does
not reasonably believe that any Person who submitted a Shareholder Election
Form and Agreement is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Regulation D under the Securities Act, such person shall not be an Electing
Holder for purposes of this Agreement and any shares held by such Person
shall be Non-Election Shares.

      SECTION 3.10  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

            (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Mellon Investor Services or other agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent") as agent  for the holders of shares of
Common Stock (the "Shares") in connection with the Merger and to receive
the Per Share Closing Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.  At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Cash Closing
Consideration and Stock Consideration (based on the Parent Closing Trading
Price).  Such Cash Closing Consideration shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent in investment grade debt securities as directed by the Shareholders'
Representative, in his sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Exchange Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings thereon shall be the
sole and exclusive property of holders of Shares to be distributed in the
sole discretion of the Shareholders' Representative. Promptly upon Parent's
request, the Exchange Agent shall pay to Parent from the Cash Closing
Consideration the pro rata portion of such amount that otherwise would have
been payable to any holder of Dissenting Shares (assuming for this purpose
only that such holders were not holders of Dissenting Shares), but only if
such amount was not taken into account in the calculation of the Dissenters
Holdback.  If there is an adjustment in the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration as provided in Section
3.2(g), in the case of an increase in the number of shares, Parent shall
make the additional shares of Parent Common Stock available to the Exchange





                                     17


<PAGE>


Agent, and in the case of a decrease in the number of shares, the Exchange
Agent, shall cancel or otherwise follow Parent's instructions with respect
to such excess shares, in each case, pursuant to Parent's statement as to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration contemplated by Section 3.2(g).

            (b)   In connection with any payment to be made with respect to
the Future Payments or any payments pursuant to Section 10.4 (any such
payments pursuant to Section 10.4 to be paid pro rata to the holders of
shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement), Parent shall pay the Shareholders' Representative
or a paying agent designated by the Shareholders' Representative the amount
required to make such payment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for
distribution to the holders of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (c)   Parent shall have no liability with respect to any
payment made pursuant to this Agreement from and after the time that Parent
makes such payment to the Exchange Agent, the Shareholders' Representative
or any paying agent designated by the Shareholders' Representative in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, that Parent shall
approve in writing each Person to whom Parent Common Stock is issued
pursuant to this Agreement, not with respect to the amount of such issuance
(for which the Shareholders' Representative shall be solely responsible),
but to confirm that such Person is an Electing Holder.

            (d)   Unless sent prior to the Effective Time, promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted pursuant to
Section 3.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of the certificates evidencing ownership thereof (the
"Certificates)" and which shall contain the agreement and acknowledgment of
the holder of such Certificates that such holder approves the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of Sections 3.10,
3.12, 10.4 and 10.5 and the appointment of the Shareholders' Representative
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation (or
compliance with Section 3.10(i) below) to the Exchange Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.10, each Certificate shall be deemed from
and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Shareholders' Representative may delay payments to such times and make such
payments in such amounts as it may determine, in its reasonable discretion,
including delaying any portion of the Per Share Closing Consideration until
the Contingent Issuance has been finally determined; provided, however,
that no portion of the Stock Consideration shall be payable to any person
other than Electing Holders and no payment may alter the amount of Merger
Consideration to which any holder is entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement as of the Effective Time.














                                     18


<PAGE>


            (e)   No shares of Parent Common Stock shall be distributed in
respect of the Stock Consideration until after the close of business on the
Adjustment Date, and each certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock so issued shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend
substantially in the following form:

      "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
      UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
      OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
      MORTGAGED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN
      EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE A
      SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
      SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED
      UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
      OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES."

            (f)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to any
Electing Holder until such shares have actually been issued to such
Electing Holder in accordance with this Section 3.10, at which time such
dividends or other distributions shall be paid.

            (g)   No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Agreement.  In lieu
of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all Shares held by
such Person) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Parent Closing Trading
Price.

            (h)   At the Effective Time, the share records of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Common Stock on the records of the Company.  From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing
ownership of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable law.
If, after the Effective Time, any certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article III.  Except as expressly provided herein, no
interest shall be paid on any amount to be paid pursuant to this
Article III.

            (i)   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
the Per Share Closing Consideration, and, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, Parent will pay Future Payments and any payments pursuant to
Section 10.4 in respect of, and in exchange for, such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

            (j)   At any time following one year after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent
to deliver to it any Parent Common Stock or funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation only as general
creditors thereof with respect to its Per Share Closing Consideration,
without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent nor the
Shareholders' Representative shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate
for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

            (k)   The right to receive Future Payments under this Agreement
shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument and shall not
be assignable or otherwise transferable by holders thereof (except by will
or by the operation of the laws of descent after the death of a natural
holder thereof, or pursuant to the valid direction of a court of competent
jurisdiction, including pursuant to a domestic relations order, true and
complete copies of which have been made available to Parent).  Any payments
made with respect to the Future Payments shall be made only to each holder
of Shares that surrendered its Certificates, or as otherwise provided in
Section 3.10(i), with respect to such Shares in accordance with this
Section 3.10 by check to the address for delivery of its Per Share Closing
Consideration set forth on the letter of transmittal provided by such
holder in connection with the surrender of its Certificates.

      SECTION 3.11  WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.  The Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Article III or otherwise such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law.  Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

      SECTION 3.12  EARLY TERMINATION.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event that any former holder of Shares
voluntarily terminates his or her employment or independent contractor
relationship with Parent and its Subsidiaries after the Closing but prior
to any Future Payment, all Future Payments payable after the date of such
termination will become due and payable to such person on the fifth
anniversary of the dates otherwise set forth in Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
and 10.4 (each such payment, a "Deferred Future Payment"); provided,
however, that this Section 3.12 shall not apply to any former holder of
Shares who (i) retires after the age of 62 and is bound by the terms of a
"noncompete" with respect to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries and is not
otherwise in breach of such terms, (ii) is terminated without "cause" or
terminates for "good reason," (iii) dies or becomes disabled or (iv) is
otherwise set forth on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Any Deferred Future Payment shall accrue compound interest at a rate equal
to the Interest Rate from the date such Deferred Future Payment would
otherwise have been paid as a Future Payment until the date such Deferred
Future Payment is actually paid.  For purposes of this Section 3.12, the
term "Interest Rate" means the sum of the following rates determined at the
close of the first business day on or after the date a Deferred Future
Payment would otherwise have been payable as a Future Payment: (a) the
annual five (5)-year U.S. dollar swap rate as quoted on Bloomberg's
interest rate swap page; (b) the annual rate of Parent's borrowing spread
pursuant to the Credit Agreement; and (c) 0.25%.  Further, for purposes of
this Section 3.12, the terms "good reason", "disabled" and "cause" shall
have the following meanings ascribed to them (i) if such Person is party to
an employment or consulting agreement with Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, the meaning set forth in such employment or consulting
agreement or (ii) if such Person is not party to an employment or
consulting agreement with Parent and its Subsidiaries, the meaning set
forth on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

      SECTION 3.13  PAYMENTS.  Whenever this Article III refers to a
payment of Merger Consideration to be made by Parent, such payment shall be
made by the sole shareholder of the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall
cause such sole shareholder to make such payment.

duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the Company's ownership or leasing of property or the

consummate each of the transactions contemplated hereby or the transactions
contemplated by any Ancillary Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event shall any of the following be a Company Material Adverse Effect, or
be taken into account in the determination of whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Change has occurred, in each
case, for purposes of clause (y) above:  (A) any change resulting from
conditions affecting any of the industries or markets in which the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries operate; (B) changes in accounting
requirements or principles; (C) any change, including the termination by

escalation or worsening thereof, but only to the extent such change,
natural disaster, sabotage, military action or war (whether or not
declared) or any escalation or worsening thereof, does not, in the case of
clauses (A), (B) or (D), affect the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
a disproportionate manner.

jurisdiction is listed in Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure

to Parent true and complete copies of each of the following documents:

                  (i)   a copy of the Plan and any amendments thereto (or
      if the Plan is not a written Plan, a description thereof);

                                     27


<PAGE>


                  (ii)  a copy of the two most recent annual reports or
      Form 5500 and actuarial reports, if required under ERISA, and the
      most recent report prepared with respect thereto in accordance with
      Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 87 and 106, if any;

                  (iii) a copy of the most recent summary, including any
      summary plan description required under ERISA with respect thereto as
      well as any formal or informal communication to employees under or in
      respect of any Plan;

                  (iv)  if the Plan is funded through a trust or any third
      party funding vehicle, a copy of the trust or other funding agreement
      and the most recent financial statements thereof, if any; and

                  (v)   the most recent opinion, notification or
      determination letter as well as any other material correspondence
      received from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") subsequent to
      the date of such opinion, notification or determination letter with
      respect to each Plan intended to qualify under section 401 of the
      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

            (c)   No liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA has
been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other
than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due).  Insofar as the
representation made in this Section 4.11(c) applies to sections 4064, 4069
or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of
ERISA to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to
make, contributions during the five (5) year period ending on the last day
of the most recent plan year ended prior to the Closing.

            (d)   The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
Title IV Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk that
such proceedings will be instituted.  With respect to each Title IV Plan,
the present value of accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent
actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to such plan
did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value of
the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.  No Title IV
Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing.

            (e)   All contributions required to be made with respect to any
Plan on or prior to the Closing have been timely made or are reflected in
the Financial Statements.  There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or change in employee participation
or coverage under, any Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such Plan above the level or expense incurred in respect
thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

            (f)   No Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in
section 4063(a) of ERISA.

            (g)   Neither the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any Plan,
any trust created thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
any Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any
party dealing with any Plan or any such trust could be subject to either a
civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax
imposed pursuant to section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.


                                     28


<PAGE>


            (h)   Each Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law,
including ERISA and the Code.

            (i)   Each Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of section 401(a) of the Code and any trust maintained thereunder intended
to be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code is entitled to
rely on an IRS opinion, notification or determination letter as to such
qualification and exemption.  Each Plan intended to satisfy the
requirements of section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such
requirements in all material respects.

            (j)   Except as set forth in Section 4.11(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or
independent contractors or former employees or independent contractors of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods extending beyond their
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable law or (ii) benefits the full cost of which is borne
by the current or former employee (or his or her beneficiary) or current or
former independent contractor.  No condition exists that would prevent the
Company or any Company Subsidiary from amending or terminating any Plan
providing health or medical benefits in respect of any active or retired
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

            (k)   No amounts payable under the Plans will fail to be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of sections 162(a)(1),
162(m) or 280G of the Code or result in the imposition of a Tax under
section 409A of the Code.

            (l)   The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
entitle any current or former employee or independent contractor or officer
of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
officer.

            (m)   There has been no material failure of a Plan that is a
group health plan (as defined in section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet
the requirements of section 4980B(f) of the Code with respect to a
qualified beneficiary (as defined in section 4980B(g) of the Code).
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has contributed to a
nonconforming group health plan (as defined in section 5000(c) of the Code)
and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
incurred a Tax under section 5000(e) of the Code which is or could become a
liability of the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

            (n)   There are no pending, or to the knowledge of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf
of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or
otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

            (o)   All contributions required to be made by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary with respect to all Foreign Plans have been timely
made. Each Foreign Plan is, and has been, maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all
applicable laws and has been maintained, where required, in good standing
with the applicable Governmental Entity.  The fair market value of the
assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for
any plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing, with
respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any obligation





                                     29


<PAGE>


in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Plan.
For purposes hereof, the term "Foreign Plan" shall mean any plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement maintained or contributed to or by, or
entered into with the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
employees (or former employees) employed outside the United States.

            (p)   No "leased employees," as that term is defined in section
414(n) of the Code, perform services for the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate.  Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has used the
services of workers provided by third party contract labor suppliers,
temporary employees, such leased employees or individuals who have provided
services as independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably be
expected to result in the disqualification of any Plan or the imposition of
penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Plan by the Internal Revenue
Service, the Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity.

            (q)   With respect to each arrangement maintained at or before
June 30, 2007, for the benefit of any current or former employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
predecessor thereof that would be a Plan but for the fact that it is not
currently in effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
ongoing liability with respect to such arrangement, such arrangement was
terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable laws, and Section
4.11(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each such
arrangement in effect at any time on or after June 30, 2006, the name of
such arrangement, its sponsor, the type of benefits it provided, and the
manner of its termination.

      SECTION 4.12  TAXES.  Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:

            (a)   The Company and each Company Subsidiary has duly and
timely filed (or there has been duly and timely filed on its behalf),
including extensions, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true and complete in all material respects, and (ii)
all Taxes or estimated payments of Taxes for which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is or may be liable (whether or not shown on any Tax
Return) in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date have
been timely paid, will be timely paid or have been provided for on the
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.  With respect to any period
(or portion thereof) through the Closing Date for which Tax Returns have
not yet been filed, or for which Taxes are not yet due or owing, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has established due and sufficient
reserves for the payments of such Taxes in accordance with GAAP, and such
current reserves through the Closing Date are duly and fully reflected in
the Financial Statements.

            (b)   No deficiencies or adjustments for Taxes have been
claimed, proposed or assessed, or to the knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, threatened by any taxing or other Governmental Entity
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that has not been resolved,
and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has received any notice,
or otherwise has any knowledge, of any potential claim, proposal or
assessment against the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any such
deficiency or adjustment for Taxes.  There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, threatened audits,
investigations, claims or other proceedings for or relating to any
liability in respect of Taxes, and there are no matters under discussion
with respect to Taxes between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, that are likely
to result in such a claim or proceeding, or an additional liability of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for Taxes.

            (c)   No closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code
(or any predecessor provision) or any similar provision of any state, local
or foreign law has been entered into by or with respect to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.



                                     30


<PAGE>


            (d)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed
to or is required to make any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the
Code by reason of any change in method of accounting.  Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any application pending with any taxing
authority requesting permission for any change in method of accounting.
The IRS has not proposed any such adjustment or change in method of
accounting.

            (e)   There are no liens for Taxes upon any property or assets
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for liens for Taxes not
yet due and payable or for which adequate reserves have been provided for
on the Financial Statements.

            (f)   The Company and each Company Subsidiary is, and has been,
in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to
the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under
any state, local or foreign laws) and has duly and timely withheld,
collected, deposited and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld,
collected, deposited or paid under such applicable laws, rules and
regulations.

            (g)   No claim has ever been made to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or Company
Subsidiary has not filed Tax Returns that the Company or such Company
Subsidiary is or may be subject to Tax by that jurisdiction.

            (h)   There are no outstanding consents, agreements, grants or
requests for the extension or waiver of any statutes of limitations
applicable to any Taxes for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
or may be liable.

            (i)   The Company, as the common parent of an affiliated group
of corporations (as defined in Section 1504 of the Code) consisting solely
of the Company and the current Company Subsidiaries that are corporations
(the "Company Group"), will file its initial consolidated return for United
States federal income Tax purposes on behalf of itself and all Company
Subsidiaries that are corporations that are "includable corporations"
(within the meaning of Section 1504(b) of the Code) for the period July 1,
2007 through June 30, 2008, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal Tax Return (or similar state or local filing group)
other than the Company Group or (ii) has any liability for Taxes of any
person (other than a member of the Company Group) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

            (j)   There are no deferred "intercompany items" (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13) with respect to
transactions among members of the Company Group, and no member of the
Company Group has an "excess loss account" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19 with respect to the stock of another member
of such group.

            (k)   No power of attorney that is currently in force has been
granted with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect
to any matters relating to Taxes.

            (l)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is, and
during the five-year period ending on the Closing Date has been, a "United
States Real Property Holding Corporation," as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and no
withholding of federal income Tax will be required under Section 1445 in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.






                                     31


<PAGE>


            (m)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received a ruling from any taxing authority or signed an agreement with
respect thereto.

            (n)   Other than this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to, is bound by, or has any obligation under
any Tax allocation, Tax indemnification or Tax sharing agreement or
arrangement of any kind, whether written or verbal, or any similar
contract.

            (o)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party
to or otherwise subject to any arrangement (i) having the effect of or
giving rise to the recognition of a deduction or loss before the Effective
Time, and a corresponding recognition of taxable income or gain after the
Effective Time, or (ii) that would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of or give rise to the recognition of taxable income or gain by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Effective Time without the
receipt of or entitlement to a corresponding amount of cash.

            (p)   Other than with respect to prior years' Tax Returns that
have already been filed, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.

            (q)   The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not
distributed to their stockholders stock of a controlled corporation, or had
their stock distributed by another company, in a transaction purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Sections 355 or 361 of the
Code, nor has any such entity been a party to a transaction purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Sections 332, 351 or 368 of
the Code.

            (r)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any transaction that (i) is the same or substantially similar
to any transaction that the IRS has determined to be a reportable
transaction (as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4 (a) and
(c)(4) (or any successor provisions)) in a notice, regulation or other form
of published guidance, (ii) was required to be registered as a "tax
shelter" under Section 6111 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, or (iii) for which a list is required to be
maintained under Section 6112 of the Code and Treasury Regulations

            (s)   No indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
consists of "corporate acquisition indebtedness" within the meaning of
Section 279 of the Code.

            (t)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any sale leaseback or leveraged lease transaction that fails
to satisfy the requirements of Revenue Procedure 75-21 or Revenue Procedure
2001-28 (or similar provisions of foreign law) or any safe harbor lease
transaction.  None of the Company's property nor any Company Subsidiaries'
property is tax-exempt use property within the meaning of Section 168(h) of
the Code.

            (u)   To the knowledge of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
that is classified for Tax purposes as a partnership, grantor trust, or
disregarded entity (a "Pass Through Subsidiary") has been taxed as a
partnership, grantor trust, or disregarded entity at all times since the
date on which such entity was formed.  Each Pass Through Subsidiary has
filed all elections, certificates, or other documents that are necessary to
obtain and maintain its status as a partnership, grantor trust, or
disregarded entity, as the case may be.  Any such election, certificate, or
other document was duly and timely filed, and no such election,
certificate, or other document has been amended, revoked, or otherwise

ever been an S corporation (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(1) of the

the Tax Returns of the Company and any Company Subsidiary.

            (x)   To the knowledge of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, no issue has been raised in any examination by any Governmental
Entity, which if known to the IRS or any other Governmental Entity, would
constitute grounds for the assessment of any Tax liability with respect to
periods that have not been audited, or that are currently under audit, by
the IRS or such other Governmental Entity.

            (y)   All transactions that would give rise to an

and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,

<PAGE>


or data to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates or
representatives) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.  As used in this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender or exchange offer
involving the Company, any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company, or any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner an equity interest in, or a portion of the business
or assets (other than purchases or sales of inventory in ordinary course of
business, acquisitions by the Company of Common Stock as contemplated by
Sections 4.2, 4.3, Article 5 and Article 6 of the Shareholders Agreement,
the Pre-Closing Transactions and issuances of shares of Common Stock to
employees, directors and contractors of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary) of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any proposal or
offer with respect to any recapitalization or restructuring with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any proposal or offer with respect
to any other transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Company shall promptly
notify Parent after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries
indicating that any Person is considering making or wishes to make an
Acquisition Proposal, identifying such Person and the terms thereof.

      SECTION 6.3 TAX MATTERS.

            (a)   PRE-CLOSING TAX RETURNS.

                  (i)   The Company shall prepare and file, or shall cause
      to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns that include the Company or
      any Company Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that end on or
      before the Closing Date and are required to be filed on or before the
      Closing Date.  The Company shall provide a copy of each such Tax
      Return filed after the date of this Agreement to Parent as soon as
      practicable prior to the filing thereof in order to give Parent the
      opportunity to review such Tax Returns prior to filing.

                  (ii) The Shareholders' Representative shall, at its own
      cost and expense, prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and
      filed, all Tax Returns that include the Company or any Company
      Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that end on or before the
      Closing Date and are required to be filed after the Closing Date.
      The Shareholders' Representative shall provide a copy of each such
      Tax Return no later than 30 days prior to the filing due date of each
      such Tax Return (including any extensions that the Shareholders'
      Representative has timely filed for) in order to give Parent the
      opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Return prior to filing.
      For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's review of Tax Returns described
      in this Section 6.3(a)(ii) and comments, or lack thereof, on such Tax
      Returns do not constitute legal or tax advice, and Parent is entitled
      to seek indemnification under Article X hereof with respect to such
      Tax Returns.  Tax Returns described in this Section 6.3(a)(ii) shall
      be signed (i) by William Leiser, and (ii) in the event that William
      Leiser is no longer employed by the Company at the time of the
      signing of any such Tax Return, then by the designee of the
      Shareholders' Representative, which designee shall be an officer of
      the Company.  None of the transactions contemplated under this
      Agreement is intended to be subject to Treasury Regulations Section
      1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (next day rule).

                  (iii) All Tax Returns referred to in this Section 6.3(a)
      shall be prepared in a manner consistent with this Agreement and, to
      the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, prior years' Tax
      Returns, using, to the extent permitted by law, methods, conventions
      and elections consistent with those previously used by or with
      respect to the Company and any Company Subsidiary.

<PAGE>


            (b)   COOPERATION AND CONTESTS.

                  (i)   COOPERATION.  The Shareholders' Representative, on
      the one hand, and Parent and the Company, on the other hand, shall
      cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
      other party, in connection with the completion and filing of all Tax
      Returns and any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
      Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
      party's request) the provision of records and information that are
      reasonably relevant to any such audit or other proceeding and making
      representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
      additional information and explanation of any material made available
      hereunder.

                  (ii)  NOTICE.  After the Closing, Parent shall notify the
      Shareholders' Representative in writing (a "Tax Notice") of any
      demand or claim received by Parent or the Company from any tax
      authority or any other party relating to Taxes of the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary (a "Tax Claim") for which indemnification may be
      sought under Article X of this Agreement within thirty (30) days of
      the receipt of such Tax Claim by Parent or the Company; provided,
      however, that a failure to give such Tax Notice will not affect the
      rights of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to indemnification
      under Article X unless, or except to the extent that, such failure
      precludes the Shareholders' Representative from contesting such Tax
      Claim.  Such Tax Notice shall contain factual information (to the
      extent known) describing the Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall
      include copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax
      authority in respect of any such Tax Claim.

                  (iii) CONTROL.  The Shareholders' Representative shall
      have the right, but not the obligation, to control, at its own
      expense, the conduct, prosecution and defense of any audit or other
      proceeding (a "Contest") relating to a Tax Claim for which
      indemnification may be sought under Article X of this Agreement;
      provided, however, that: (i) the Shareholders' Representative shall
      not be entitled to control the conduct of any Contest unless it
      provides Parent with notice of its intent to exercise its right to
      control such Contest within fifteen (15) days of receiving the
      related Tax Notice and acknowledges in writing that Parent and the
      Surviving Corporation are entitled to be indemnified for such Taxes
      under Article X of this Agreement, and (ii) Parent may participate
      (at its own cost and expense) in any such Contest.  Notwithstanding
      any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall, at its own
      expense, control: (i) any Contest pertaining to any taxable year or
      period beginning after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax
      Period"), (ii) any Contest relating or pertaining to amounts together
      with the Aggregate Claimed Amount and Established Losses that would
      exceed the limit set forth in Section 10.1(g), and (iii) any Contest,
      the resolution of which would affect the Tax liability of the Company
      or any Company Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period, including,
      without limitation, any Contest concerning Tax Returns filed by the
      Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
      Period, and shall not settle or contest any such Contest without the
      consent of the Shareholders' Representative, which consent shall not
      be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  In the event that
      a Contest involves a Straddle Period (a "Straddle Contest") and the
      Shareholders' Representative elects to control such Straddle Contest,
      the parties shall endeavor to cause the Straddle Contest proceeding
      to be separated into two or more separate proceedings, each of which
      involves exclusively (i) Contests applicable to Pre-Closing Tax
      Periods, which shall be controlled by Shareholders' Representative,
      and (ii) Contests applicable to all other taxable periods, which
      shall be controlled by Parent.  In the event that such separation
      cannot, after diligent efforts, be achieved, Parent shall control the
      Straddle Contest; provided, however, that Parent shall not settle,
      compromise and/or concede such Contest without the consent of the
      Shareholders' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably


                                     55


<PAGE>


      withheld, conditioned or delayed.  To the extent the Shareholders'
      Representative controls all or a portion of any Contest or Straddle
      Contest, the Shareholders' Representative shall keep Parent informed
      regarding the status of such Contest or Straddle Contest.  Except as
      otherwise provided for in this Section 6.3(b), Parent shall control
      the conduct, prosecution and defense of all other Contests and shall
      have the exclusive right to settle or contest any such Contest
      without the consent of the Shareholders' Representative; provided,
      however, that if Parent is entitled to indemnification under Article
      X hereof with respect to such Contest, Parent shall not settle such
      Contest without the consent of the Shareholders' Representative,
      which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
      As used herein, (i) the term "Straddle Period" means a taxable period
      that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date,
      and (ii) the term "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means any taxable period
      that ends on or prior to the Closing Date and that portion of a
      Straddle Period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date.

            (iv)  PARENT'S CONSENT.  With respect to a Contest or Straddle
      Contest that is described in paragraph (iii) of this Section 6.3(b)
      and that the Shareholders' Representative controls, the ability of
      the Shareholders' Representative to settle, compromise and/or concede
      any such Contest or Straddle Contest shall be subject to Parent's
      written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
      delayed, if the proposed settlement, compromise or concession of the
      Shareholders' Representative would adversely affect a Tax liability
      of Parent, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable
      period that ends after the Closing Date; provided, however, if Parent
      does not provide the Shareholders' Representative with such written
      consent, and the Shareholders' Representative agrees to provide
      indemnification to Parent pursuant to Article X with respect to the
      amount that the Shareholders' Representative was willing to pay the
      Tax authority and the Tax authority was willing to accept to settle
      the Contest or Straddle Contest, Parent shall receive such
      indemnification pursuant to Article X and release any further right
      to indemnification with respect to the Tax Claim that was the subject
      of such proposed settlement, and Parent shall assume control over the
      conduct of the related Contest or Straddle Contest and shall have all
      rights to make decisions, settle, compromise, and/or concede such
      Contest or Straddle Contest.

            (c)   CERTIFICATES.  Parent, the Company and the Shareholders'
Representative shall, upon request, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements).

            (d)   INFORMATION REPORTING.  Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative agree, upon request, to provide one another with all
information that the requesting party may be required to report under
Section 6043A of the Code or Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

            (e)   TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS.  Notwithstanding anything in any
other agreement to the contrary, all Tax allocation or Tax sharing
agreements or arrangements of any kind to which the Company and any Company
Subsidiary is a payor on or prior to the Closing Date (other than this
Agreement) shall cease and terminate as of the Closing Date.












                                     56


<PAGE>


            (f)   CERTAIN COVENANTS.  From and after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, without providing at least
ten (10) days' notice to Parent, amend any Tax Return, make any Tax
election or change any Tax election already made, adopt any Tax accounting
method, change any Tax accounting method, enter into any closing agreement
or settle any material claim or material assessment relating to Taxes or
consent to any claim or assessment relating to Taxes or any waiver of the
statute of limitations for any such claim or assessment.  With respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and except as otherwise required by law, neither
Parent, the Company, nor any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior
written consent of the Shareholders' Representative, make or change any
election, file or cause the amendment of a Tax Return, change an annual
accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, or take any other
similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return relating to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries.  Parent agrees that it will not take a
position, and will not permit the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to
take a position, on any Tax Return for a Post-Closing Tax Period that is
inconsistent with the Company's reporting of the Company's 2007
reorganization transaction, including the exchange offer and other
transactions related to the formation of the Company and the issuance of
securities of the Company in connection therewith, including issuance of
the Contingent Issuance on its 2007 and its short period 2008 federal
income Tax Return ending at the Closing Date.

            (g)   TAX REFUNDS.  Any refund of Taxes of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (including any interest with respect thereto)
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle
Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be the property of the
shareholders of the Company in existence immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and the amount of any such Tax Refund, shall be paid promptly to the
Shareholders' Representative and, if received by Parent, the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, shall be payable promptly to the Shareholders'
Representative.  In the event that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
are entitled by law to a refund of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the Closing
Date, Parent agrees to cooperate with the Shareholders' Representative to
file or cause to be filed, at the expense of the Shareholders'
Representative, an amended Tax Return or refund claim relating to such Tax
refund.  To the extent that any Tax benefit resulting from an amended Tax
Return or claim for Tax refund of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle
Period that ends on the Closing Date is carried forward to a Post-Closing
Tax Period, Parent agrees that as such Tax benefit is actually realized in
a Post Closing Period, Parent will promptly remit the cash equivalent of
such realized Tax benefit to the Shareholders' Representative.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the cash equivalent of a Tax benefit
referred to in this Section 6.3(g) shall not be due from Parent to the
Shareholders' Representative if such Tax benefit was taken into account in
determining the Closing Consideration Amount or Receivables Payment.

            (h)   SECTION 338 ELECTION.  Parent covenants not to make or
cause to be made (and Parent covenants that the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub will not make or cause to be made) any election or deemed election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous or similar rules in any
relevant domestic or foreign Tax jurisdiction) with respect to the
acquisition of the Company and any Company Subsidiary.

            (i)   NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.  Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or warrant to any shareholders of the Company
concerning (i) the tax treatment of the Company's 2007 reorganization
transaction or (ii) the transactions contemplated by, or payments made
under, this Agreement.






                                     57


<PAGE>


            (j)   TAX TREATMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.  Except as
otherwise required by the Code, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that (i) the right to the Future Payments shall be treated as deferred
payment consideration issued solely in exchange for the Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and any rights to receive
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) no
portion of the Merger Consideration shall be treated as compensation, and
no party hereto shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with
this provision.  Further, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree for Tax
purposes that the Merger Sub will be disregarded in the Merger and that the
Merger will be treated as a purchase by the sole shareholder of the Merger
Sub of the Common Stock owned by the Shareholders immediately before the
Closing in exchange for the Merger Consideration, which will be paid by the

newly incorporated entity formed to consummate the Merger, will conduct no
operations other than related to the Merger.


                                 ARTICLE VII

                            ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS


      SECTION 7.1  INFORMATION STATEMENT.  As promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, in consultation with Parent, the Company shall prepare an
information statement (together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
the "Information Statement") relating to the Merger, which shall contain
the notices required pursuant to the TBOC in connection with the Merger and
otherwise comply with all applicable laws, and cause the Information
Statement to be mailed to its shareholders.

      SECTION 7.2 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

            (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby.  Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to
execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and
other writings and to take such other actions as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

            (b)   Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take
reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (which actions shall include, furnishing
all information required under the HSR Act or any comparable laws of
foreign jurisdictions and in connection with approvals of, filings with,
and inquiries or requests from, any Governmental Entity); shall promptly
cooperate with and furnish information to each other or their counsel in
connection with any such requirements imposed upon any of them or any of
their Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; and shall not take any action that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity necessary
to be obtained prior to Closing.  Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, take
commercially reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and shall cooperate
with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity or other public or private
third party required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or the taking of any action contemplated
thereby or by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other
covenant herein contained, in connection with the receipt of any necessary
approvals under the HSR Act or any comparable laws of foreign
jurisdictions, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (i)

                                     58

divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits Parent's or the Company's freedom of action with respect to, or
their ability to retain, the Company or any portions thereof or any of the
businesses, product lines, properties or assets of the Company or Parent or
(ii) in the event any action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by a Governmental Entity challenging the transactions
contemplated hereby, contest or resist any such action or proceeding,
including any administrative or judicial action, or have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (c)   Prior to the Closing, each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide any
necessary information with respect to, and provide the other (or its
counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.  Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of
any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby unless otherwise prohibited by law.  If
either the Company or Parent or any of their respective affiliates receives
a request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.  To the
extent that transfers, amendments or modifications of permits (including
environmental permits) are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers,
amendments or modifications.

      SECTION 7.3  NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.  The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company
of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, (b) any
litigation or investigation commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or otherwise involving Parent or Merger Sub or the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (c) any failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

      SECTION 7.4  ACCESS; CONFIDENTIALITY.  From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as April 24, 2006, between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall (and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to) afford the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financing sources and other representatives of Parent
and Merger Sub, reasonable access during normal business hours to all of
its employees, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records
(including Tax Returns).  During the period from the date hereof until the
Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub (a) a copy of
each report or other document provided to the shareholders of the Company
and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, to the extent in
the possession or under the control of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.  All obligations of Parent and its representatives under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time.

      SECTION 7.5  PUBLICITY. Except as may be required by law or the rules
and regulations of any national security exchange, from the date hereof
through and including the Closing Date, none of the parties hereto, nor any
of their respective affiliates, shall issue any press release or make any
public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior approval of the other parties.

      SECTION 7.6  INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a)   Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors of the Company as provided in its
certificate of formation or bylaws shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time.  In addition, for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless all individuals who at any time prior to
the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law for any acts or omission occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall advance
periodically and promptly upon a request therefor to such individual his or
her legal and other expenses, subject to the provision by such individual
of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a
determination that such individual is not entitled thereto.

            (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company may
purchase, at its sole cost and expense, a fully prepaid "tail" policy
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance and (ii) the Company shall
purchase, with the costs thereof to be an Integration Cost, a fully prepaid
"tail" policy (reasonably acceptable to Parent) providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the Company's current errors and omissions liability
insurance with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time.

The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such policy so purchased to be maintained in full force and
effect for its full term; provided, however, that neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its affiliates shall be required to incur any costs
or expenses or otherwise have any liability in connection with such policy
or claims made thereunder.

            (c)   The obligations under this Section 7.6 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 7.6 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.6).

      SECTION 7.7  TAKEOVER LAWS.  If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or to the Company, then the Company and the Company Board of
Directors shall take all action necessary to ensure that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

      SECTION 7.8  INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; FINANCING.  During the
period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent
consolidated monthly financial statements within 30 calendar days following
the end of each fiscal month.  Further, the Company shall use, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist Parent with respect
to Parent's financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements (the "Financing") and in connection
with Section 7.14.  The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, employees,
consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting, to provide on a


                                     60

timely basis, reasonable cooperation in connection with the foregoing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i) participation in
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions
with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, business projections
and similar documents required in connection with the Financing; (iii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants
to provide assistance and cooperation to Parent, including participating in
accounting due diligence sessions, providing consent to Parent to use their
audit reports relating to the Company and providing any necessary "comfort
letters"; (iv) executing and delivering definitive financing documents,
including pledge and security documents or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
certificates of the chief financial officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral; provided that no obligation of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any such agreement,
document or pledge shall be effective until the Effective Time; (v) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain title insurance reasonably
requested by Parent; (vi) as promptly as practicable, use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to Parent and its Financing sources with all
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company reasonably
requested by Parent including all financial statements and data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, including audits thereof to
the extent so required (which audits shall be unqualified), and the other
accounting rules and regulations of the SEC (the "Required Financial
Information"); (viii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit
the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company's
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing;
provided that no right of any lender, nor obligation of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, thereunder shall be effective until the
Effective Time; (ix) entering into one or more credit or other agreements
on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Financing
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that no obligation of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under such credit or other
agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time; (x) procuring the
release of liens and pay- off letters related to any indebtedness of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to be repaid in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or that have otherwise been repaid; and
(xi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation
of the Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the
proceeds of the Financing; provided that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or similar fee or
incur any liability with respect to the Financing prior to the Effective
Time.  The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries' logos as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the
Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

      SECTION 7.9  PRE-CLOSING TRANSACTIONS.  The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to the Closing Date, consummate
(i) the disposition of the Private Funds (and the general partners
thereof), the equity interests in Staubach Retail Services, Inc. and the
licenses held by Staubach Retail Services, Inc. and Cypress Equities, LLC
(collectively, the "Business Dispositions") in the manner as described on
Section 7.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the reorganizations
with respect to The Staubach Company - San Diego, Inc. and Staubach Great
Lakes Inc. (collectively, the "Roll-Up Transactions") pursuant to the
transaction agreements substantially in the forms set forth as Exhibits C
and D, respectively, (iii) the termination of the existing licenses held by



                                     61


<PAGE>


Corporacion Mexicana de Inmuebles, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries;
Staubach Western Canada Corp., RGM Holdings Inc. and Robert Muzyka; and
Staubach Eastern Canada, Inc. and Jean Chalifour, pursuant to the
termination notices substantially in the forms set forth as Exhibits E, F
and G, respectively (collectively, the "License Terminations") and (iv) the
transactions referenced in Section 7.9(A) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Other Pre-Closing Transaction" and together with the License
Terminations, Business Dispositions and the Roll-Up Transactions, the
"Pre-Closing Transactions") (it being understood that Parent may not assert
a failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.3(g) due to the failure
of the Other Pre-Closing Transaction to be consummated at or prior to the
Closing if the failure to consummate the Other Pre-Closing  Transaction was
caused by the failure by a Subsidiary of Parent to comply in all material
respects with its obligations with respect to such transaction as described
on Section 7.9(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).  The Company shall
keep Parent informed on a regular basis concerning material developments in
the Pre-Closing Transactions and the means by which such transactions are
to be effected.  As part of the Business Dispositions, Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for a
transition services agreement to be entered into at Closing by the
Surviving Corporation for the provision of certain transition services (to
be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company) to Staubach Retail
Services, Inc. and  Cypress Equities, LLC.  Also as part of the Pre-Closing
Transactions, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide for a transition services agreement to be entered into
at Closing by the Surviving Corporation for the provision of certain
transition services (to be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company)
to Columbus Realty.  Except as set forth in any such transition services
agreements, the Company agrees that after the Effective Time, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
will have any obligations or liabilities under any license agreement
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
Staubach Retail Services, Inc., Cypress Equities, LLC or their respective
Subsidiaries, on the other hand.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 7.9 shall limit or expand the indemnity provided in Article X.

      SECTION 7.10  SARBANES-OXLEY COMPLIANCE.  The Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives, to take all actions that Parent reasonably may deem
necessary or appropriate, including to permit representatives of Parent to
meet from time to time with the representatives of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries responsible for the financial statements and the
internal controls of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to enable
Parent, immediately following the Closing, to satisfy its obligations under
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") pursuant thereto (the "SOA") and the other
requirements of the SOA with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, including establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as
such terms are defined in the SOA. Any out of pocket expenses incurred by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, at the request of Parent, in
connection with the foregoing shall be Integration Costs.

      SECTION 7.11  CERTAIN APPOINTMENTS.  As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause Roger T. Staubach to be appointed to the board of directors of
Parent.  Thereafter, unless Roger T. Staubach's employment with Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries is terminated  by Parent without "cause," by Roger
T. Staubach for "good reason" or due to Roger T. Staubach's "disability"
(as such terms are defined in Roger T. Staubach's employment agreement with
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries) and as long as Roger T. Staubach
complies with Parent's policies and guidelines applicable to all members of
its board of directors, Parent shall cause Roger T. Staubach to be included
in the slate of persons nominated to serve as directors on Parent's board
of directors during any Earnout Calculation Period.  Upon any termination
of Roger T. Staubach's employment with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries by




                                     62


<PAGE>


Parent with "cause," by Roger T. Staubach without "good reason" or due to
"disability," Roger T. Staubach shall promptly resign from the board of
directors.  As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Greg P. O'Brien
and John A. Gates to be appointed to the Americas Executive Committee, and
while such persons are employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, they
shall continue to serve on such committee (or its successor) during any
Earnout Calculation Period.  For the avoidance of doubt, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach of this Section 7.11 by Parent shall be
specific performance in accordance with Section 11.10, and in no event
shall Parent have any liabilities for Losses arising from any breach of
this Section 7.11.

      SECTION 7.12  STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING.  Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued as Stock Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance.

      SECTION 7.13  CERTAIN PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.  The Company shall not,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary not to, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) sell, offer to sell,
contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to
purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or
indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate
or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder with respect to any Parent Common Stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Parent Common Stock, or
warrants or other rights to purchase Parent Common Stock or any such
securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of Parent Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for Parent Common Stock, or warrants or other rights to
purchase Parent Common Stock or any such securities, whether any such
transaction is to be settled by delivery of Parent Common Stock or such
other securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce an
intention to, or solicit or encourage any other Person to, effect any
transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) above.

      SECTION 7.14  REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

            (a)   Parent shall (i) as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, but in no event before the second trading day after Parent's earnings
release for the period ended June 30, 2008 (subject to receipt of  the
Required Financial Information), file with the SEC a registration statement
under the Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor short form
registration involving a similar amount of disclosure; or if then
ineligible to use any such form, then any other available form of
registration statement) for a public offering of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the Electing Holders in the Merger (the
"Registrable Stock") to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415
of the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement") and, unless such
Registration Statement is automatically effective upon filing, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective as soon as practicable after filing and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
remain effective until the earlier of (A) the date when all Registrable
Stock covered by the Registration Statement has been sold or (B) 180 days
after the Registration Statement is declared effective and (iii) to prepare
and file with the SEC any required amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and the prospectus (including any prospectus
supplement) used in connection therewith ("Prospectus").  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to register or to maintain
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement after the Registrable Stock
first becomes eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144.  In connection with
the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions contemplated by
Section 7.8 whether such actions are required to be taken before or after
the Effective Time.



                                     63


<PAGE>


            (b) (i) Upon the issuance by the SEC of a stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of
proceedings with respect to the Registration Statement under Section 8(d)
or 8(e) of the Securities Act or (ii) if the Registration Statement shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or any Prospectus forming a part of the
Registration Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (including, in any such case, as a result of the
non-availability of financial statements, (A) (1) in the case of clause
(ii) above, Parent shall as promptly as practicable prepare and file a post
effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related Prospectus so that such Registration Statement does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and such Prospectus does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Stock being sold thereunder, and in the case of a post
effective amendment to the Registration Statement, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause it to be declared effective as promptly as is
reasonably practicable and (2) in the case of clause (i) above, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such stop order to be lifted, and
(B) give notice to the Electing Holders that the availability of such
Registration Statement is suspended (a "Deferral Notice") and, upon receipt
of any Deferral Notice, each Electing Holder agrees that it shall not sell
any Registrable Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement until such
Electing Holder receives copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
provided for in clause (A) above and/or is notified of the effectiveness of
the post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement provided for in
clause (A) above, or until it is advised in writing by Parent that the
Prospectus may be used.

            (c)   In connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Section 7.14, Parent shall pay all registration fees under the
Securities Act, all printing expenses and all fees and disbursements of
Parent's legal counsel, Parent's independent registered public accounting
firm and any other persons retained by Parent, and any other expenses
incurred by Parent.  Each Electing Holder shall pay any discounts,
commissions and transfer taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of
Registrable Stock and any other expenses incurred by it.

            (d)   Indemnity.

                  (i)   Parent agrees to indemnify each Electing Holder
      against any and all loss, liability, claim and damage arising out of
      any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
      Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the omission therefrom of a
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
      make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
      which they were made, not misleading or arising out of any untrue
      statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (or any
      amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission therefrom of a
      material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
      misleading; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to
      any loss, liability, claim or damage to the extent arising out of any
      untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
      with information furnished to Parent in writing by or on behalf of an
      Electing Holder for use in the Registration Statement (or any
      amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
      thereto).





                                     64


<PAGE>


                  (ii)  Each Electing Holder agrees to indemnify Parent,
      and each person, if any, who controls Parent within the meaning of
      either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
      Act against any and all loss, liability, claim and damage described
      in the indemnity contained in subsection Section 7.14(d)(i) but only
      with respect to untrue statements or omissions made in the
      Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus
      (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
      conformity with information furnished in writing to Parent by or on
      behalf of such Electing Holder for use in the Registration Statement
      (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or
      supplement thereto).

                  (iii) Each indemnified party shall give notice as
      promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any
      action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which
      indemnity may be sought under this Section 7.14, but failure to so
      notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying
      party from any liability Section 7.14, except to the extent the
      indemnifying party demonstrates that its defense of such action is
      actually and materially prejudiced thereby.  In case any such action
      shall be brought against any indemnified party, the indemnifying
      party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
      that it shall wish to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
      reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice
      from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election
      so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not
      be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7.14 for any
      legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case
      subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with
      the defense thereof, unless the indemnifying party has failed or is
      failing to vigorously defend such claim, provided, however, that the
      indemnifying party  shall not, in connection with any one such action
      or proceeding or separate but substantially similar actions or
      proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be liable
      for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
      at any time for all indemnified persons.   No indemnifying party
      shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties,
      settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
      respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
      governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
      whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution is
      sought under this Section 7.14(d) (whether or not the indemnified
      parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such
      settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional
      release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of
      such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not
      include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a
      failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  No
      indemnified party shall, without the prior written consent of the
      indemnifying party, effect any settlement of any commenced or
      threatened litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim in respect
      of which any indemnification is sought under this Section 7.14(d).

                  (iv)  If the indemnification provided for in Section
      7.14(d) from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified
      party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
      liabilities referred to in Section 7.14(d), the indemnifying party,
      in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to
      the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of
      such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, in such
      proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
      indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the
      actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
      liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
      No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
      of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
      contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
      misrepresentation.

      on a Tax Return), as reduced by the amount of any Tax detriments

      during, after, or prior to the tax period in which the
      indemnification payment is made in connection with the accrual,
      incurrence or payment of any such Losses.  The term "Shareholder
      Losses" means, in the case of indemnification pursuant to Section
      10.1(b)(i) or (ii), "Losses," and in the case of indemnification
      pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii), the amount Parent was required to
      pay pursuant to Article III of this Agreement that Parent did not pay

      "knowledge," "material" or materiality or similar language, if any,
      and without reduction for items set forth in the Company Disclosure
      Schedule to this Agreement) or (y) of any covenant contained in
      Section 6.3; (3) Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
      combined, unitary or similar group of which the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor of the Company or any Company
      Subsidiary) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
      including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any
      analogous or similar laws; (4) Taxes for which the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary is liable as a transferee or successor, which
      Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or before the
      Closing Date (other than Taxes attributable to actions taken by
      Parent out of the ordinary course of business following the Closing
      on the Closing Date); (5) Taxes or other payments in respect of Taxes
      owed by a Person other than the Parent, the Company, or a Company
      Subsidiary required to be made to any party after the Closing Date by
      the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to a contract (other
      than this Agreement), including any Tax sharing, indemnity, or
      allocation agreement (whether or not written), that was entered into

      actions taken by Parent out of the ordinary course of business
      following the Closing on the Closing Date); (6) all applicable sales,
      transfer, recording, deed, stamp and other similar Taxes, including
      any real property transfer or gains Taxes (if any), resulting from

      and (7) the amount of any Taxes payable by the Company or any Company
      Subsidiary in any Post-Closing Tax Period, or the portion of a
      Straddle Period that ends after the Closing Date, to the extent such
      Taxes relate to any adjustment to such entity's items of income,
      gain, loss, deduction, or credit made pursuant to Section 481 of the
      Code or any corresponding provision of foreign, state, or local law
      as a result of an action or event that occurred on or before the
      Closing Date (the "Section 481 Adjustment").  Notwithstanding any
      other provision of this Agreement, solely for purposes of determining
      the amount of any Tax Loss attributable to a Section 481 Adjustment,
      the amount of such Section 481 Adjustment shall be treated as the
      only item of income or gain earned by the Company or Company
      Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the taxable year or portion
      thereof to which such Section 481 Adjustment relates.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Tax Loss
      shall be reduced to the extent of the amount of such Tax, if any,
      taken into account in determining the Closing Consideration Amount or
      Receivables Payment.

      appropriately any Taxes (other than Taxes described in clause (6) of
      the definition of "Tax Losses") relating to any taxable year or
      period that includes a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to
      the extent permitted under applicable law, (x) elect with the
      relevant Governmental Entity to treat, for all purposes, the Closing
      Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company or
      any Company Subsidiary and (y) elect the "closing of the books"
      method of accounting with respect to allocations between taxable
      periods ending on the Closing Date and any taxable periods ending
      after the Closing Date. The portion of a Straddle Period ending on
      the Closing Date shall be treated as a short taxable year and a
      Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of Section 10.1(c).  In any case
      where applicable law does not permit the Company or any Company
      Subsidiary to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
      year or period of such Company or Company Subsidiary with respect to
      Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the amount
      of any Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
      Closing Date shall:

                        (1)   in the case of Taxes that are either (a)
      based upon or related to income or receipts or (b) imposed in
      connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property
      (real or personal, tangible or intangible) be determined based on an
      interim closing of the books as of the end of business on the Closing
      Date (except that, solely for purposes of determining the marginal
      tax rate applicable to income or receipts during such period in a
      jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level of income
      or receipts, annualized income or receipts shall be taken into
      account, if appropriate, for an equitable sharing of such Taxes), and

                        (2)   in the case of all other Taxes not described
      in subparagraph (1) above (including those imposed on a periodic
      basis or measured by the level of any item), be deemed to be the
      amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
      Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
      the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
      numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle
      Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
      of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
      period.

For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes described in clause (6) of the
definition of Tax Losses shall not be subject to apportionment as described
above, and Parent shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to the
full amount of such Taxes.

            (d)   No indemnification shall be available under Section
10.1(a)(i) or 10.1(b)(i):

                  (i)   unless and until (A) all Losses incurred by all
      Parent Indemnified Parties or Shareholder Indemnified Parties, as
      applicable, with respect to any particular single matter,
      circumstance, event or occurrence or related group of matters,
      circumstances, events or occurrences exceed $20,000 ("Covered
      Losses") and (B) the aggregate amount of all such Covered Losses
      exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), in which case,
      indemnification shall be available for all Covered Losses, in excess
      of the Basket Amount; or

                  (ii)  for Losses in excess of $155,885,000, in the
      aggregate;

      PROVIDED that none of the foregoing limitations shall apply to any
      breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections
      4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1 or 5.2 hereof or any fraudulent breach of any
      representation or warranty; PROVIDED FURTHER, that the limitations
      set forth in Section 10.1(d)(i) shall not apply to the first $500,000
      of Losses resulting from any breach of the representations and
      warranties contained in Section 4.11 hereof, it being understood that
      all such Losses in excess of $500,000 shall be subject to the
      foregoing limitations.

            (e)   No indemnification shall be available under Section
10.1(a)(ii), (v), (vi) or (viii) or 10.1(b)(ii) unless and until all the
aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by all Parent Indemnified Parties
or Shareholder Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the
matters covered thereby exceeds $1,000,000, in which case, indemnification
shall be available for all Losses, in excess of such amount.

            (f)   No indemnification shall be available under Section
10.1(a)(ii), (iv) (v), (vi) or (viii) or 10.1(b)(ii) for Losses in excess
of $124,708,000, in the aggregate.

            (g)   No indemnification shall be available under Section
10.1(a)(iii) or (vii) for Losses in excess of the total amount of the
Future Payments, in the aggregate (without giving effect to any reduction
in the amount paid with respect thereto in accordance with Sections
3.3(d)(ii) or 10.4).

            (h)   Except (i) in the case of fraud, (ii) as provided in
Sections 3.3(c),  3.7 or 7.14 or (iii) with respect to claims for specific
performance or other equitable remedies, from and after the Effective Time,
the remedies set forth in this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies by Parent or the shareholders of the Company for any inaccuracy of
any representation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company contained in this Agreement.

            (i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, from and after the Effective Time, in no event shall Parent have
any obligation to make aggregate payments to the former shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Article III with respect to the Future Payments, in
respect of Losses pursuant to this Article X or otherwise in excess of the
total amount of the Future Payments.

      SECTION 10.2  SURVIVAL.

            (a)   The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and shall
expire on the date that is 30 months after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.11, 4.12 and 4.17(l) shall survive until the date that is 90 days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as such period may
be extended by tolling or waiver); (ii) the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as such period may be
extended by tolling or waiver); and (iii) if, at any time prior to
expiration of the applicable representation and warranty, written notice is
delivered to the Shareholders' Representative, in the case of a claim by
the Parent Indemnified Parties, or to Parent, in the case of a claim by the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties, alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in
or a breach of such representation and warranty and asserting a claim for
recovery under Article X based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then
the representation or warranty underlying the claim asserted in such notice
shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

            (b)   A Parent Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(ii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (viii) and a
Shareholder Indemnified Party's right to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall expire on the date that is 30 months after the
Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if, at any time prior to expiration of
such right, written notice is delivered to the Shareholders'
Representative, in the case of a claim by a Parent Indemnified Party, or to
Parent, in the case of a claim by a Shareholder Indemnified Party,
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 10.1(a)(ii), (iv), (v), (vi)
or (viii)  or 10.1(b)(ii), as applicable, then the indemnification rights
thereunder shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

            (c)   A Parent Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii) and a Shareholder Indemnified Party's
right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) shall expire on
the date that is 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (as such period may be extended by tolling or waiver);
provided, however, if, at any time prior to expiration of such right,
written notice is delivered to the Shareholders' Representative, in the
case of a claim by a Parent Indemnified Party, or to Parent, in the case of
a claim by a Shareholder Indemnified Party, asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 10.1(a)(iii) or 10.1(b)(iii), as applicable, then the
indemnification rights thereunder shall survive until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved.

            (d)   A Parent Indemnified Party's right to indemnification

such claim is fully and finally resolved.

      SECTION 10.3  INFORMATION; WAIVER.  The right to indemnification
based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this

to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.  The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

      SECTION 10.4  SET-OFF RIGHTS.

            (a)   Parent shall have the right to withhold and set-off
against any Future Payment, the amount of any claim for indemnification or
payment of  Losses pursuant to Section 10.1(a) in accordance with this
Section 10.4.  In addition, Parent shall also be entitled to the right to
recoup the Merger Consideration paid to any shareholder in accordance with
Section 10.5, but only to the extent the amount of the remaining Deferred
Payments minus (i) the Aggregate Claimed Amount then outstanding, if any,
and (ii) the aggregate amount of Established Losses that have not been
satisfied in full, if any, is not in excess of the amount sought to be
recouped.












                                     75


<PAGE>


            (b)   Parent shall exercise its set-off and withholding rights
by delivering written notice to the Shareholders' Representative (the
"Claim Notice").  The Claim Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
with respect to the claim asserted thereby, to the extent known by Parent,
(i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim and (ii) the
amount of Losses actually suffered or incurred and a good faith estimate of
the amount of Losses expected to be suffered or incurred (to the extent
then estimable by Parent) in connection with such claim (the aggregate of
such amounts, the "Claimed Amount").  Parent may, in good faith, increase
the Claimed Amount in connection with any claim by delivering another Claim
Notice with respect thereto.

            (c)   The Shareholders' Representative shall have 30 days after
receipt of a Claim Notice to dispute all or any portion of the Claimed
Amount set forth in the Claim Notice by delivering a written notice of
dispute to Parent.  If Parent does not receive timely notice of such
dispute, the Claimed Amount set forth in such Claim Notice shall be deemed
established and conclusive for all purposes and shall not be subject to
appeal or other proceedings disputing the right to indemnification with
respect to such claim or the Claimed Amount with respect thereto (an
"Undisputed Claim").

            (d)   If the Shareholder's Representative delivers timely
notice of a dispute with respect to all or any portion of a Claimed Amount
as provided in Section 10.4(c) and the Shareholders' Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days of the delivery of
such notice of dispute, at the request of either the Shareholders'
Representative or Parent, the dispute shall be submitted to binding
arbitration as the sole and exclusive method of resolving such dispute.

            (e)   If, as set forth in Section 10.4(d), any dispute is
submitted to binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted (i) by
a single arbitrator agreed upon by the Shareholders' Representative and
Parent within fifteen days of the receipt by respondent of a copy of the
demand for arbitration, or (ii) in the absence of such timely agreement, by
three arbitrators one appointed by each of the Shareholders' Representative
and Parent within thirty days of the receipt by respondent of a copy of the
demand for arbitration and the third appointed by the two party appointed
arbitrators within fifteen days of the appointment of the second
arbitrator, or in default of such timely appointment, by the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAA's Commercial
Arbitration Rules (the "Rules"), (the arbitrator agreed upon in accordance
with clause (i) or the three arbitrators appointed in accordance with
clause (ii) being referred to herein as the "Arbitral Tribunal").  The
arbitration shall be conducted and administered by the AAA in accordance
with the Rules then in effect and the following provisions:

                  (i)   In the event of any conflict between the Rules and
      the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement
      shall prevail and be controlling.

                  (ii)  The arbitration shall be held and the award shall
      be rendered in New York, New York.

                  (iii) Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the
      arbitration hearing (or as soon thereafter as practicable), the
      Arbitral Tribunal shall prepare and distribute to the parties a
      writing setting forth the arbitral award and the findings of fact and
      conclusions of law on which it is based. Any award rendered by the
      Arbitral Tribunal shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
      parties and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court
      of competent jurisdiction.

                  (iv)  The Arbitral Tribunal shall have no power or
      authority, under the Rules or otherwise, to (i) modify or disregard
      any provision of this Agreement or (ii) address or resolve any issue
      not submitted by the parties.



                                     76


<PAGE>


                  (v)   In connection with any arbitration proceeding
      pursuant to this Agreement, the fees and costs of the AAA and the
      Arbitral Tribunal, the costs and expenses of obtaining the facility
      where the arbitration hearing is held, and such other costs and
      expenses as the Arbitral Tribunal may determine to be directly
      related to the conduct of the arbitration shall be the responsibility
      of the non-prevailing party.  If the Shareholders' Representative is
      the non-prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be deemed
      Established Losses for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (vi)  By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not
      intend to deprive any New York Court of its jurisdiction to issue a
      pre-arbitral injunction to maintain the status quo or prevent
      irreparable harm, a pre-arbitral attachment or other order in aid of
      arbitration proceedings.  Without prejudice to such provisional
      remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a national
      court, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have full authority to grant
      provisional remedies or order the parties to request that a court
      modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by a such
      court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect
      the Arbitral Tribunal's orders to that effect.

            (f)   The full amount of each Claimed Amount shall remain a
Claimed Amount except to the extent (i) such amount is an Undisputed Claim,
(ii) Parent and the Shareholders' Representative enter into a written
agreement to reduce the amount of the Claimed Amount in connection with the
settlement of any claim for indemnification with respect thereto (a
"Settlement Agreement"), (iii) an Arbitral Tribunal has finally determined
that a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to all or any portion of the
Claimed Amount (a "Final Determination") or (iv) an Arbitral Tribunal has
finally determined that a Parent Indemnified Party is not entitled to all
or any portion of the Claimed Amount.  The aggregate amount of all Claimed
Amounts outstanding is referred to as the "Aggregate Claimed Amount."  The
amount of any Losses finally established pursuant to a Settlement
Agreement, an Undisputed Claim or Final Determination is referred to as an
"Established Loss."

            (g)   The amount of each Future Payment shall be reduced by the
sum of (i) the Aggregate Claimed Amount, if any, plus (ii) the aggregate
amount of Established Losses that have not been satisfied in full by a
reduction in a prior Future Payment, in each case, as of the date such
Future Payment was otherwise due to have been paid pursuant to this
Agreement (the "Payment Date").  The amount by which a Future Payment is
reduced as a result of the Aggregate Claimed Amount as of a Payment Date is
referred to as the "Withheld Amount."

            (h)   If at any time the aggregate amount of Withheld Amounts
exceeds the sum of (1) the Aggregate Claimed Amount, plus (2) the aggregate
amount of Established Losses that have not been not been satisfied in full
by a reduction in a prior Future Payment, in each case, as of such time,
Parent shall pay an amount in cash equal to such excess (and, if such
excess results from a final determination from an Arbitral Tribunal that a
Parent Indemnified Party is not entitled to all or any portion of a Claimed
Amount, a notional amount equal to interest on the amount of such excess at
the Agreed Rate for the period beginning on the most recent date on which a
Future Payment was paid or payable and amounts were withheld from such
payment and ending on the date such excess amount is paid) in accordance
with Section 3.10(b).












                                     77

      SECTION 10.5  RECOUPMENT.  The shareholders of the Company, by
approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
accepting any Merger Consideration, hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Merger Consideration is intended to be an amount net of any Losses
recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder under Section
10.1(a)(i) (with respect to any breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.3 or 4.4 or any fraudulent breach
of any representation or warranty) or Section 10.1(a)(iii) or (vii). The
Merger Consideration shall be reduced by, and Parent shall be entitled to
recoup therefrom, an amount equal to any such Losses.  Accordingly, the
right of any shareholder of the Company to receive any Merger Consideration
is subject to the right of Parent to recoup such Losses from such
shareholder to the full extent of the Merger Consideration received by such
shareholder.  By accepting any Merger Consideration, each such shareholder
is accepting the provisions of this Agreement, including this Article X
that reduce the net amount that is ultimately payable as Merger
Consideration, and acceptance by any such shareholder of benefits pursuant
to this Agreement binds such shareholder to this Section 10.5 and entitles
Parent to recovery on account of any such Losses as provided herein. For
the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of recouping any Losses from a
shareholder of the Company who received Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 10.5, the value of each such share of Common Stock received by
such holder shall be deemed equal to the Parent Closing Trading Price (or
Parent Adjustment Trading Price or Floor Price, if applicable), and any
Losses so recouped from such a shareholder shall be paid by such
shareholder in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock (up to the number of
shares issued to such person pursuant to this Agreement).

      SECTION 10.6  THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

            (a)   In the event that any written claim or demand is received
for which indemnification will be sought under this Article X in respect of
any claim or any action or proceeding by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement or an affiliate of a party to this Agreement or is asserting
a claim in respect of the rights of a party to this Agreement or an
affiliate of a party to this Agreement or is or was a shareholder of the
Company at or prior to the Effective Time or is asserting a claim in
respect of the rights of Person who is or was a shareholder of the Company
at or prior to the Effective Time (a "Third Party Claim"), Parent, in the
case of such a written claim or demand received by a Parent Indemnified
Party, shall promptly notify the Shareholders' Representative, and the
Shareholders' Representative, in the case of such written claim or demand
received by the Shareholder Indemnified Parties, shall promptly notify
Parent (the person seeking such indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"),
of such Third Party Claim (a "Third Party Claim Notice").  Subject to
Section 6.3(b) and Section 10.6(d), Parent, in the case of a Third Party
Claim Notice submitted to Parent by the Shareholders' Representative, and
the Shareholders' Representative on the behalf of such former shareholders
of the Company in the case of a Third Party Claim Notice submitted to the
Shareholders' Representative by Parent (the recipient of a Third Party
Claim Notice, the "Indemnifying Party") shall have the right, upon delivery
of written notice to the Indemnified Party (the "Defense Notice") within
ten (10) days after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice, which Defense
Notice shall specify the counsel the Indemnifying Party will appoint to
defend such claim, to conduct at its expense the defense against such
claim; PROVIDED, that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing and
without qualification the right of the Indemnified Party to be indemnified
for all Losses incurred in connection with such Third Party Claim.  The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of
any such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 10.6(a).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the
defense of such action is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.



                                     78


<PAGE>


            (b)   In the event that the Indemnifying Party does deliver a
Defense Notice and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct such defense,
including asserting affirmative defenses available to the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, subject to Section 10.6(d)(iii) below.
The Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in
the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing.  The Indemnified Party
shall not settle any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought
without consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

            (c)   No Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of
the Parent Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

            (d)   The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control
any Third Party Claim if (i) such claim for indemnification is with respect
to a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation,
(ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party or its affiliates, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim, (iv)
such claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates, (v) in the case where the
Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, such claim would
materially interfere with or materially and adversely affect the business,
reputation, operations or assets of the Parent Indemnified Party or any of
its affiliates or (vi) in the case where the Indemnified Party is a Parent
Indemnified Party, the amount of damages reasonably anticipated to result
from such claim, together with the Aggregate Claimed Amount and Established
Losses, would exceed the applicable indemnification limitations set forth
in Sections 10.1(d)(ii), 10.1(f) or 10.1(g).

      SECTION 10.7  TREATMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.  Any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated
as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all income Tax purposes.  If
a Parent Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party pursuant to
a Contribution Agreement in connection with a claim for indemnity pursuant
to this Article X, upon the written request of the Shareholders'
Representative, the Surviving Corporation shall assign, to the extent
assignable in accordance with the terms of the applicable Contribution
Agreement (without recourse and only to the extent of such indemnity
payment) such rights to the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the
former shareholders of the Company.

      SECTION 10.8  ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.  With respect to any claim by
Parent for indemnification pursuant to this Article X, Parent shall
advance, as incurred and promptly following the request of the
Shareholders' Representative, all costs of investigation and defense that
are incurred by the Shareholders' Representative or his representatives in
connection therewith, provided, that the amount so advanced shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) $2,000,000 or (ii) the amount of remaining
Deferred Payments minus (A) the Aggregate Claimed Amount then outstanding,
if any, and (B) the aggregate amount of Established Losses that have not
been satisfied in full.  Any such amounts so advanced shall be deemed to be
Established Losses under this Article X.

                                MISCELLANEOUS


      SECTION 11.1  SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE.

            (a)   The shareholders of the Company, by approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or accepting any Merger
Consideration, hereby irrevocably appoint Roger T. Staubach, Gregory P.
O'Brien and John A. Gates (each, a "Shareholders' Representative Member"
and collectively, the "Shareholders' Representative") as their agent and
attorney-in-fact for all purposes under this Agreement with full and
exclusive power and authority to bind such shareholders with regard to all
matters arising under and pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including for purposes of Article X and Sections 3.3,
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, 3.11, 6.3 and 11.2 or otherwise relating to
the rights to receive payments hereunder and consent to the taking by the
Shareholders' Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions in connection with or related to the foregoing; provided that
only the act of a majority of Shareholders' Representative Members shall be
binding and determinative as the act of the Shareholders' Representative.
By its execution below, the Shareholders' Representative hereby accepts its
appointment as the Shareholders' Representative for purposes of this
Agreement.  Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Shareholders' Representative on all matters arising under and pursuant to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall be
entitled to rely on any and all action taken or not taken by the
Shareholders' Representative without independent investigation and
notwithstanding any knowledge of any dispute or disagreement among the
shareholders of the Company or the Shareholders' Representative Members.
If any of the Shareholders' Representative Members shall die, become

Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation."  As used in this
Agreement, the terms "affiliates" and "associates" shall have the meanings

as posted in the Company's electronic data room (https://services.
intralinks.com/AZ?w=597922&br=9976138786&p=3) prior to the date hereof or
as otherwise provided to Parent in writing prior to the date hereof.  The
words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice
versa, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders and words
denoting natural persons shall include corporations and partnerships and
vice versa.  The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement.  In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

      SECTION 11.7  JURISDICTION.  Except as provided in Sections 3.3(f),
3.7(c) and 10.4(e), each of the parties hereby expressly and irrevocably
submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and to the
jurisdiction of any other competent court of the State of New York sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York (collectively, the "New
York Courts"), preserving, however, all rights of removal to such federal
court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in connection with all disputes arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts.  Each such party hereby waives the right to
any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to
which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or future
domicile.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that each
of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding
for enforcement of a judgment entered by the New York Courts in any other
court or jurisdiction.

      SECTION 11.8  SERVICE OF PROCESS.  Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 11.7 in any such action
or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in

right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any
other legally available method.

      SECTION 11.9 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

      SECTION 11.10  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.  Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this
Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately
harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages.  It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement.

      SECTION 11.11  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed manually
or by facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents referred to
herein and delivered in connection with this Agreement:

            (a)   constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, including that
certain Letter of Intent, by and between Parent and the Company, dated as
of April 1, 2008, among the parties or any of them with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof (provided that the provisions of this
Agreement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement), and

            (b)   except as provided in Article X and Section 11.1, are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

      SECTION 11.13  SEVERABILITY.  If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner adverse to any party.  Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

      SECTION 11.14  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof (other than
with respect to matters governed by the TBOC, with respect to which such
law shall apply).

      SECTION 11.15  HEADINGS.  Headings of the Articles and Sections of
this Agreement, the Table of Contents and the Index of Defined Terms are
for the convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no substantive
or interpretative effect whatsoever.

      SECTION 11.16  WAIVERS.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to
insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

      SECTION 11.17  ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that (i)
Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to Parent, one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof and (ii) Parent and Merger
Sub may assign any or all of its rights hereunder, but not its obligations
hereunder to any of its financing sources.  Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and permitted assigns.
