(" _Applied U.S. HoldCo_ "), which is to be the direct parent of Applied
Merger Sub; and (bb) cause HoldCo, TEL Merger Sub, Applied Merger Sub and
Applied U.S. HoldCo to become parties to this Agreement promptly following
each such entitys formation by virtue of the execution and delivery of one

value per share, of HoldCo (" _HoldCo Ordinary Shares_ ") in accordance with
the TEL Conversion Ratio; and (3) immediately following consummation of the
TEL Merger, Applied Merger Sub will merge with and into Applied (the "
_Applied Merger_ " and, together with the TEL Merger, collectively, the "
_Business Combination_ "), with Applied surviving the Applied Merger as an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo and the issued and outstanding
shares of Applied Common Stock being converted into the right to receive
HoldCo Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Applied Conversion Ratio.

C. The respective boards of directors of Applied and TEL have each
unanimously determined that the Business Combination and the other
Contemplated Transactions are consistent with, and will further, the business
strategies and goals of Applied and TEL, and have each unanimously: (1)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Business Combination;
and (2) determined, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to

this Agreement, and, in the case of TEL, approve the TEL Merger Agreement.

D. For Japanese Tax purposes, it is intended that no tax will be levied upon:
(1) TEL; (2) its stockholders (except to the extent that the TEL stockholders

receive cash pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights); or (3) TEL
Merger Sub (except with respect to any HoldCo shares issued to TEL upon
HoldCos incorporation and transferred to HoldCo following the TEL Merger)
resulting from the TEL Merger and any Contemplated Transactions effected
in furtherance of the TEL Merger, and without limiting the foregoing,
specifically that the TEL Merger and any Contemplated Transactions effected in
furtherance of the TEL Merger:

 

(aa) will not subject TEL to gain or loss taxation on the market value of its
assets and liabilities under Section 62 of the Japanese Corporation Tax Act; (bb) in accordance with paragraph 2 of Section 61-2 and paragraph 1
of Section 24 of the Japanese Corporation Tax Act and paragraph 1 of Section
25 of the Japanese Income Tax Act as well as paragraph 3 of Section 37-10 of
the Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxation, will not subject TEL

the Contemplated Transactions) and which are held by a holder who, as of the
Closing: (A) has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Applied
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; and (B)
has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Applied Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such holder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive any
HoldCo Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 1.3(d)(iii), but shall
be entitled only to such rights (if any) as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Applied Dissenting Shares.

 



5 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.3(e)(i), if any Applied
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect,
waiver, withdrawal or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed
automatically, as of the Applied Merger Effective Time, to have been converted
into, and to represent only, the right to receive HoldCo Ordinary Shares in
accordance with Section 1.3(d)(iii), without interest thereon, upon proper
delivery of the Applied Stock Certificates or (in the case of Book Entry
Shares) evidence of book-entry positions representing such shares.

(iii) Applied shall give TEL prompt notice of: (A) any demand for appraisal
received from its stockholders prior to the Applied Merger Effective Time

pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; and (C) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. Applied
shall not make any payment or settlement offer with respect to any such demand
unless, prior thereto, TEL shall have consented in writing to such payment
or settlement offer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(a) At the Business Combination Effective Time, except as otherwise provided
in Section 1.4(a)(ii):

 

(i) each Applied Option, Applied RSU and Applied Performance Unit that is
outstanding and either unexercised (if exercise is required under the award),
or not yet converted into or settled in shares of Applied Common Stock
immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective Time, whether or not
vested, shall be converted into and become a HoldCo Option, HoldCo RSU or
HoldCo Performance Unit, as applicable, that is exercisable for, convertible
into or otherwise entitles the holder to HoldCo Ordinary Shares, as
applicable, and HoldCo shall assume such Applied Option, Applied RSU or
Applied Performance Unit in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective Time) of the Applied
Equity Plans and the other agreements by which they are governed or evidenced
as determined by the administrator of the applicable Applied Equity Plan, or
the Applied Board or the applicable committee thereof, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 1.4;

 

(ii) each TEL Subscription Right that is outstanding and either unexercised
(if exercise is required under the award), or not yet converted into or
settled in shares of TEL Common Stock immediately prior to the TEL Merger
Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall, immediately prior to the TEL
Merger Effective Time, be acquired by TEL for no consideration and cancelled,
and shall, at the Business Combination Effective Time, be substituted with a
HoldCo Subscription Right that is exercisable for, convertible into or
otherwise entitles the holder to HoldCo Ordinary Shares, as applicable, with
terms and conditions that are substantially the same as the terms and
conditions governing the applicable TEL Subscription Right immediately prior
to its cancellation, except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.4; and

 

(iii) each Applied Cash Award that is outstanding, unvested or subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with Applied immediately
prior to the Business Combination Effective Time, shall be assumed by HoldCo
in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Business Combination Effective Time) of the Applied Equity Plans and the other
agreements by which they are governed or evidenced as determined by the
administrator of the applicable Applied Equity Plan or the Applied Board or
the applicable committee thereof, except as otherwise provided in this Section
1.4.

 



6 (b) As a result of the conversions and assumptions or substitutions, as
applicable, of securities or other rights set forth in Section 1.4(a), from
and after the Business Combination Effective Time: (i) each Applied Option,
Applied RSU, Applied Performance Unit or TEL Subscription Right assumed or
substituted for, as applicable, by HoldCo may be exercised for or converted
into solely HoldCo Ordinary Shares; (ii) the number of HoldCo Ordinary Shares
subject to each Applied Option, Applied RSU, Applied Performance Unit or TEL
Subscription Right assumed or substituted for, as applicable, by HoldCo shall
be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Applied Common Stock or
TEL Common Stock that were subject to such Applied Option, Applied RSU,
Applied Performance Unit or TEL Subscription Right immediately prior to the
Business Combination Effective Time or, in the case of TEL Subscription
Rights, the cancellation thereof in accordance with Section 1.4(a)(ii), by the
Applied Conversion Ratio or the TEL Conversion Ratio, as applicable, and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of HoldCo
Ordinary Shares (and any dividend equivalents credited to the account of each
holder of an assumed Applied RSU or Applied Performance Unit as of the
Business Combination Effective Time shall remain credited to such holders
account immediately following the Business Combination Effective Time, subject
to the terms and conditions of the applicable Applied Equity Plan and the
applicable Applied RSU or Applied Performance Unit); (iii) the per share
exercise price for the HoldCo Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of each
Applied Option or TEL Subscription Right assumed or substituted for, as
applicable, by HoldCo shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise
price of Applied Common Stock or TEL Common Stock subject to such Applied
Option or TEL Subscription Right, as in effect immediately prior to the
Business Combination Effective Time or, in the case of TEL Subscription
Rights, the cancellation thereof in accordance with Section 1.4(a)(ii), by
the Applied Conversion Ratio or the TEL Conversion Ratio, as applicable, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent or yen, as
applicable; and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any Applied Option or
on the conversion, other settlement or payment of any Applied RSU, Applied
Performance Unit or Applied Cash Award (together, the Applied Options, Applied
RSU, Applied Performance Unit or Applied Cash Award, the " _Applied Equity
Awards_ ") or TEL Subscription Right assumed or substituted for, as
applicable, by HoldCo shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule, repurchase option, risk of forfeiture and
other provisions of each Applied Equity Award or TEL Subscription Right
assumed or substituted for, as applicable, by HoldCo shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption thereof;  _provided, however,_ that
HoldCo Subscription Rights may contain any restrictions required for
compliance with or exemption from applicable securities laws; _provided,
further_ , that the HoldCo Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Applied Board or TEL Board or any
committee of any such board, as applicable, with respect to each Applied
Equity Award and TEL Subscription Right assumed or substituted for, as
applicable, by HoldCo.

 

(c) To the extent any assumed Applied Equity Award would reasonably be
expected to be, immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective Time,
subject to any performance-based vesting or other performance conditions, the
administrator of the applicable Applied Equity Plan or the Applied Board or
the applicable committee thereof, may, prior to the Business
Combination Effective Time, and after offering TEL an opportunity to provide
input or to the extent permitted by this Agreement (including the Applied
Disclosure Schedule), remove the applicable performance goals or make such
adjustments, if any, to the applicable performance goals or conditions
relating to such Applied Equity Awards as the administrator of the applicable
Applied Equity Plan or the Applied Board or such applicable committee thereof
may reasonably determine to be necessary or appropriate as a result of the
consummation of the Business Combination, which adjustments shall, except as
otherwise provided by this Agreement or determined by Applied after offering
TEL an opportunity to provide input, take effect upon and be subject to the
consummation of the Business Combination and, in each case, subject to and

 



7  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Applied Equity
Plans and the Applied Equity Awards as determined by the administrator of the
applicable Applied Equity Plans or the Applied Board and/or such applicable
committee thereof, and _provided_ that, except with respect to adjustments
permitted by this Agreement, any such adjustments do not prevent the
assumption of such Applied Equity Awards under the terms of the applicable
Applied Equity Plan.

(d) HoldCo shall file with the SEC, no later than 15 days after the date on
which the Business Combination becomes effective, a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form), if available for use by
HoldCo, relating to: (i) the HoldCo Ordinary Shares issuable with respect to
the Applied Equity Awards, Applied ESPP Options and TEL Subscription Rights
assumed or substituted for, as applicable, by HoldCo in accordance with
Sections 1.4(a) and 1.4(e); (ii) Restricted Shares converted into restricted
HoldCo Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 1.5; and (iii) any other
securities issuable pursuant to any other employee benefit plans of any
Applied Entity or TEL Entity that are assumed by HoldCo.

 

(e) At the Business Combination Effective Time, HoldCo will assume the Applied
ESPPs and each option to purchase shares of Applied Common Stock under the
Applied ESPPs (each, an " _Applied ESPP Option_ ") that is outstanding as of
the Business Combination Effective Time will be converted into and become an
option to purchase HoldCo Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, from and after the
Business Combination Effective Time: (i) each Applied ESPP Option assumed by
HoldCo will be automatically exercised solely for HoldCo Ordinary Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Applied ESPP; (ii)
each Applied ESPP Option so assumed by HoldCo shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Applied
ESPP, except that the shares of Applied Common Stock reserved for issuance
under the Applied ESPP shall be converted into that number of HoldCo Ordinary
Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the
number of Applied Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Applied ESPP
multiplied by the Applied Conversion Ratio and, for purposes of determining
at what price HoldCo Ordinary Shares will be purchased under the assumed
Applied ESPP Options, the fair market value per share of HoldCo Ordinary
Shares at the beginning of each offering period in effect as of the Business
Combination Effective Time shall be equal to the fair market value per share
of the Applied Common Stock at the beginning of each such offering period
divided by the Applied Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, and each applicable Applied ESPP Option shall be similarly
adjusted as described in this clause "(ii);" and (iii) any restriction on an
Applied ESPP Option, as set forth in the terms of the Applied ESPP under which
it was granted or any award or subscription agreement thereunder, will
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding such assumption or
replacement, except as provided above. Further, the HoldCo Board or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Applied Board or any committee thereof with respect to each assumed Applied
ESPP Option and the administration of the Applied ESPP.

 

(f) Notwithstanding Section 4.15(a), but subject to Sections 4.15(e) and
4.15(f), if the TEL ESPP is in effect as of immediately prior to the TEL
Merger Effective Time or if it has been previously terminated for reasons
connected with the Contemplated Transactions, then at the Business Combination
Effective Time, HoldCo shall either: (i) assume the TEL ESPP and cause such
TEL ESPP to continue to be operated for the purchase of HoldCo Ordinary Shares
in accordance with its terms as amended accordingly; (ii) allow, for the
period beginning on the United States Closing Date and ending on the Benefit
End Date, all TEL Continuing Employees to participate in the HoldCo ESPPs on
the same terms and conditions as the other similarly situated participants in
such HoldCo ESPPs, so long as such Person remains employed by HoldCo or one of
its Subsidiaries; or (iii) ensure that, for the period beginning on the
United States Closing Date and ending on the Benefit End Date, each TEL
Continuing Employee who participated in the TEL ESPP as of immediately prior
to the TEL Merger Effective Time and remains employed by HoldCo or one of its
Subsidiaries shall receive either benefits or monetary

 



8  value (with monetary value measured as the equivalent monetary value to the
contributions TEL would have been obligated to contribute on behalf of such
TEL Continuing Employee _plus_ the monetary value of any ancillary Tax
benefits or discounts that such TEL Continuing Employee would have realized by
virtue of the participation in the TEL ESPP, as any such Tax benefits and
discounts were in effect as of the last purchase date prior to the
termination of the TEL ESPP) that are substantially similar to the benefits
such TEL Continuing Employee would have received under such TEL ESPP if such
TEL Continuing Employee had continued to participate in such TEL ESPP and such
TEL ESPP had remained in effect at the same level as in effect immediately
prior to the termination of the TEL ESPP.

(g) At the Business Combination Effective Time, if HoldCo determines it
appropriate, HoldCo may assume any or all of the Applied Equity Plans. If
HoldCo elects to so assume any Applied Equity Plan, then, under such Applied
Equity Plan, HoldCo will be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of
such Applied Equity Plan, as of the Business Combination Effective Time
(including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of
the termination or forfeiture of a HoldCo equity award that is issued or
granted as a result of the conversion of an Applied Option, Applied RSU or
Applied Performance Unit pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent permitted
by the terms and conditions of the applicable Applied Equity Plan), except
that: (i) shares covered by such awards will be HoldCo Ordinary Shares; (ii)
all references in such Applied Equity Plan to a number of shares will be
deemed amended to refer instead to the number of HoldCo Ordinary Shares equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the applicable
number referenced multiplied by the Applied Conversion Ratio; and (iii) the
HoldCo Board or a committee thereof will succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Applied Board or any committee thereof with respect to
the administration of such Applied Equity Plan.

 

(h) Prior to the Closing, each of Applied and TEL shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take all actions that may be necessary under the Applied
Equity Plans, the TEL Equity Plans and the TEL ESPP, respectively, or
otherwise, including, if necessary, that TEL shall cause HoldCo to adopt one
or more HoldCo Equity Plans and file any required registration statements (to
the extent awards are not granted under an applicable exemption), to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.4 and Section 1.5, and to ensure
that, from and after the Business Combination Effective Time, holders of
Applied Options, Applied RSUs, TEL Subscription Rights, Applied Performance
Units, Applied Cash Awards and Applied ESPP Options and participants in the
TEL ESPP will have only those rights with respect thereto specifically
provided in this Section 1.4. Applied and TEL shall provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment on any documents to be adopted by the other
in order to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.4 and Section 1.5.

 

1.5 Restricted Shares. If any shares of Applied Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective Time are unvested or
are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract
with Applied, or under which Applied has any rights (such shares, "
_Restricted Shares_ "), then (except to the extent provided in any binding
agreement between Applied and the holder thereof): (a) the HoldCo Ordinary
Shares issued in exchange for such Restricted Shares of Applied Common
Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition; and (b) the certificates or book-entry
positions, as the case may be, representing such shares of Applied Common
Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends reflecting such
restrictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the HoldCo Board or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Applied Board
or any committee thereof, as applicable, with respect to each Restricted
Share converted into a restricted HoldCo Ordinary Share. To the extent any
Restricted Shares are, immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective
Time, subject to any performance-based vesting or other performance
conditions, the administrator of the applicable Applied Equity Plan or the
Applied Board or the applicable committee thereof, may, prior to the Business
Combination Effective Time, to the extent 

 



9  permitted by this Agreement (including the Applied Disclosure Schedule),
remove applicable performance goals and/or make such adjustments, if any, to
the applicable performance goals or conditions relating to such Restricted
Shares as such administrator of the applicable Applied Equity Plan or the
Applied Board or the applicable committee thereof may reasonably determine to
be necessary or appropriate as a result of the consummation of the Business
Combination, which adjustments shall, except as otherwise provided by this
Agreement, take effect upon the Business Combination Effective Time and be
subject to the consummation of the Business Combination and, in each case,
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Applied Equity Plan and the Applied Restricted Share agreement, and _provided_
that, except with respect to adjustments permitted by this Agreement, any
such adjustments do not prevent the assumption of such Applied Equity Awards
under the terms of the applicable Applied Equity Plan. Prior to the Business
Combination Effective Time, Applied shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that, from and after the Business Combination Effective Time, HoldCo
is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract.

 

1.6 Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares shall be issued in connection with
the Business Combination or the other Contemplated Transactions, and no
certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued.

(b) Any holder of shares of Applied Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a HoldCo Ordinary Share (after aggregating
all fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares issuable to such holder) pursuant to
Section 1.3 of this Agreement shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and
upon surrender of such holders Applied Stock Certificate(s) or cancellation
of such holders Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock, be paid in cash
the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to such holders pro rata share of the Net Fractional Share Proceeds.
The aggregate of all fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares to which the holders of
Applied Common Stock would be entitled if not for the prohibition on
issuance of fractional shares set forth in Section 1.6(a), rounded down to
the nearest whole share, is referred to herein as the " _Excess HoldCo Share
Number_."

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Business Combination
Effective Time, HoldCo shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and in a
manner consistent with applicable Legal Requirements, cause the Excess HoldCo
Share Number of HoldCo Ordinary Shares to be sold by the Exchange Agent in a
commercially reasonable manner, and to cause the Exchange Agent to distribute
a cash amount equal to the pro rata share of the proceeds raised from such
sale, _minus_ applicable commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs incurred in connection with such sale (such cash amount,
the " _Net Fractional Share Proceeds_ "), to the Applied stockholders who
would have been entitled to fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares in accordance
with their pro rata share of such proceeds.

 

(d) Any holder of TEL Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fraction of a HoldCo Ordinary Share (after aggregating all fractional
HoldCo Ordinary Shares issuable to such holder) at the TEL Merger Effective
Time shall, in lieu of such fraction of a HoldCo Ordinary Share, be paid in
cash the yen amount (rounded as necessary up to the nearest whole yen) equal
to: (i) the fraction of a HoldCo Ordinary Share such TEL stockholder would
otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.2 of this
Agreement; _multiplied by_ (ii) the quotient of (A) the volume-weighted
average price per share of TEL Common Stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for
the five consecutive trading days preceding (but not including) the date on
which TEL Common Stock is delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange prior to the
TEL Merger Effective Time  _divided by_ (B) the TEL Conversion Ratio.

 



10 1.7 Closing of Applied Transfer Books; No Further Transfer of TEL Shares.

 

(a) At the Applied Merger Effective Time: (i) except for shares of Applied
Common Stock that continue to be held by an Applied Entity in accordance with
Section 1.3(d)(ii), and subject to Section 1.3(e), all shares of Applied
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Applied Merger Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock or of Applied
Stock Certificate(s) shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
Applied, except the right to receive: (A) HoldCo Ordinary Shares as
contemplated by Section 1.3; (B) cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo Ordinary
Shares pursuant to Section 1.6; and (C) any dividends or other distributions,
if any, pursuant to Section 1.8(e); and (ii) the stock transfer books of
Applied shall be closed with respect to all shares of Applied Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Applied Merger Effective Time (except for
shares of Applied Common Stock that continue to be held by an Applied Entity
in accordance with Section 1.3(d)(ii)). No further transfer (or registrations
of transfer) of any such shares of Applied Common Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books after the Applied Merger Effective Time. If, after the
Applied Merger Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing
any shares of Applied Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Applied Merger Effective Time (an " _Applied Stock Certificate_ ") or a Book
Entry Share of Applied Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent or to
the Applied Surviving Corporation or HoldCo, such Applied Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Share of Applied Common Stock shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 1.8.

 

(b) At the TEL Merger Effective Time: (i) except for shares of TEL Common
Stock that cease to exist in accordance with Section 1.2(d)(i) (including TEL
Dissenting Shares), all shares of TEL Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the TEL Merger Effective Time shall automatically cease to exist, and
all holders of TEL Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of TEL, except the right to receive: (A) HoldCo Ordinary Shares
as contemplated by Section 1.2; (B) cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo Ordinary
Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(d); and (C) dividends or other distributions,
if any, pursuant to Section 1.8(e); and (ii) the stock transfer books of TEL
shall be closed with respect to all shares of TEL Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the TEL Merger Effective Time. No further transfer (or
registration of transfers) of any such shares of TEL Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the TEL Merger Effective Time. After
the TEL Merger Effective Time, except for shares of TEL Common Stock that will
cease to exist in accordance with Section 1.2(d)(i) (including TEL Dissenting
Shares), Persons who held Book-Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the TEL Merger Effective Time shall be entitled to
receive HoldCo Ordinary Shares in accordance with the exchange procedures
provided in Section 1.8 or agreed upon pursuant to Section 4.13.

1.8 Exchange of Certificates and Cancellation of Book-Entry Positions.

(a) Prior to the Japan Closing Date, Applied and TEL shall mutually agree
upon a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Business
Combination (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Business Combination
Effective Time: (i) TEL Merger Sub shall cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of TEL Common Stock, the
number of HoldCo Ordinary Shares necessary to effect the TEL Merger; and (ii)
Applied U.S. HoldCo shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Applied Common Stock, the number of HoldCo
Ordinary Shares necessary to effect the Applied Merger. The HoldCo Ordinary
Shares so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with all cash in lieu of
fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares as contemplated by Section 1.6 and any
dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such
HoldCo Ordinary Shares as contemplated by Section 1.8(e), if any, are referred
to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 



11 (b) Promptly after the Business Combination Effective Time, HoldCo shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of Applied
Stock Certificates or who held Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock
immediately prior to the Applied Merger Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Applied, TEL
and the Exchange Agent shall agree prior to the Closing (including a provision
confirming that delivery of Applied Stock Certificates or cancellation of
book-entry positions representing Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Applied Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Applied Stock Certificates or
evidence of such book-entry positions representing Book Entry Shares of
Applied Common Stock to the Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Applied Stock Certificates or cancellation of book-
entry positions representing Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock
in exchange for HoldCo Ordinary Shares, cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo
Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and dividends or other distributions,
if any, received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such HoldCo Ordinary
Shares as contemplated by Section 1.8(e). Upon surrender of Applied Stock
Certificates or presentation of evidence of book-entry positions representing
Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock to the Exchange Agent for exchange,
together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
HoldCo: (A) the holder of such Applied Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
of Applied Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
number of whole HoldCo Ordinary Shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.3 (and cash in lieu of
fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and dividends or
other distributions, if any, contemplated by Section 1.8(e)); and (B) the
Applied Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.8(b), each Applied Stock Certificate and, until cancelled as
contemplated by this Section 1.8(b), each Book Entry Share of Applied Common
Stock shall be deemed, from and after the Applied Merger Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive HoldCo Ordinary Shares as contemplated by
Section 1.3 (and cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares pursuant to
Section 1.6 and dividends or other distributions, if any, contemplated
by Section 1.8(e)). If any Applied Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, HoldCo may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition to the issuance of any certificate representing HoldCo Ordinary
Shares, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Applied Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact and to deliver a
bond (in such sum as HoldCo may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, HoldCo, Applied or TEL
with respect to such Applied Stock Certificate.

(c) If any of the HoldCo Ordinary Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional
HoldCo Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and dividends or other
distributions, if any, contemplated by Section 1.8(e)) is to be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Applied Stock
Certificate or the transferred Book Entry Share of Applied Common Stock, as
applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance that: (i)
such Applied Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Book Entry Share of Applied Common
Stock shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Applied Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share of Applied Common Stock, as
applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) With respect to the conversion of TEL Common Stock into the right to
receive HoldCo Ordinary Shares as contemplated by the TEL Merger Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to establish
procedures prior to the TEL Stockholders Meeting to facilitate the prompt
delivery of HoldCo Ordinary Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo
Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and dividends or other distributions,
if any, contemplated by Section 1.8(e)) as

 



12  contemplated by the TEL Merger Agreement upon presentation of evidence of
book-entry positions representing Book Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock. The
Parties acknowledge that such procedures shall be substantially in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.8(b) as applied to the former stockholders of
Applied Common Stock, but will take into account the operational and other
issues with respect to the actual delivery of the HoldCo Ordinary Shares to
former holders of TEL Common Stock based upon the efforts of the Parties
pursuant to Section 4.13.

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
HoldCo Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Business Combination
Effective Time shall be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any
unsurrendered Applied Stock Certificate or to the holder of any Book Entry
Shares of Applied Common Stock or Book Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock, in
each case, with respect to the HoldCo Ordinary Shares that such holder has the
right to receive in connection with the Business Combination until such
holder surrenders such Applied Stock Certificate or causes the book-entry
positions representing such Book Entry Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject
to the effect of any applicable abandoned property law, escheat laws or other
similar Legal Requirements, to receive all such dividends and distributions,
without interest).

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Applied Stock Certificates, Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock or Book
Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock, as the case may be, as of the date that is
one year after the date on which the Business Combination Effective Time shall
be delivered to HoldCo upon demand, and any holders of Applied
Stock Certificates, Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock or Book Entry
Shares of TEL Common Stock, as the case may be, who have not theretofore
surrendered their Applied Stock Certificates or caused to be cancelled the
book-entry positions representing their Book Entry Shares of Applied Common
Stock or Book Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock, as the case may be, in
accordance with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to HoldCo for, and
be entitled to receive from HoldCo, satisfaction of their claims for HoldCo
Ordinary Shares, cash in lieu of fractional HoldCo Ordinary Shares and any
dividends or distributions, if any, with respect to HoldCo Ordinary Shares.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
Exchange Agent, HoldCo, the Applied Surviving Corporation, Applied U.S.
HoldCo, TEL and TEL Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable and any other payment
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of any Applied Common Stock, TEL Common Stock, Applied Option, Applied
RSU, Applied Performance Unit, Applied Cash Award or TEL Subscription Right,
as applicable, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from
such payment under any provision of Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. The Exchange Agent, HoldCo, the Applied Surviving
Corporation, Applied U.S. HoldCo, TEL and TEL Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall timely deliver the amounts so deducted or withheld to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent such amounts are so deducted,
withheld, deposited or timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of
Applied Stock Certificates, Book Entry Shares of Applied Common Stock or Book
Entry Shares of TEL Common Stock, as the case may be, as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any public official shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of HoldCo free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None
of HoldCo, the Applied Surviving Corporation, the TEL Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former

 



13  holder of Applied Common Stock or TEL Common Stock or to any other Person
with respect to any HoldCo Ordinary Shares (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other
similar Legal Requirement.

 

1.9 Adjustments. If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Business Combination Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Applied
Common Stock or TEL Common Stock are changed into a different number or class
of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the Applied Conversion Ratio and TEL Conversion
Ratio, as the case may be, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 1.9 shall
be construed as permitting Applied or TEL to take any action or enter into
any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

MATTERS  
---|--- 

2.1 Formation of Entities. Unless otherwise agreed to by Applied and TEL:

 

(a) on a date to be mutually agreed by Applied and TEL prior to the filing of
the Form S-4 Registration/Proxy Statement, TEL shall cause HoldCo to be
formed as a public limited company ( _naamloze vennootschap_ ) under the laws
of the Netherlands, which, from the date of its formation until immediately
prior to the TEL Merger Effective Time, will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of
TEL;

prohibit Applied or TEL, respectively, from furnishing nonpublic information
to, or entering into discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response
to an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably expected to result in a Superior
Offer that is submitted by a Person after the date hereof (and not
withdrawn) if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach
of, or any action inconsistent with, any of the provisions set forth in this
Section 4.3(b); (B) the Applied Board or the TEL Board, as the case may be,
concludes in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be a breach of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements; (C) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Applied Board or the TEL
Board, as the case may be, gives TEL or Applied, respectively, written notice
of the identity of such Person and the intention to furnish nonpublic

Board or the TEL Board, as the case may be, receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions (including

and the terms thereof and copies of all correspondence and other written
material sent or provided to such Party in connection therewith) that is made
or submitted by any Person (other than Applied or TEL) during the Pre-Closing
Period. Each of Applied or TEL, as applicable, after receiving an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, shall keep TEL or Applied, respectively,

Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii) the status and terms of any material
modification or material development or proposed material modification or
material development thereto.

 

(d) Each of Applied and TEL agrees that it, its Subsidiaries, and its and its
Subsidiaries respective officers, directors and employees shall, and that it

activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry.

(e) Each of Applied and TEL agrees not to release or permit the release of
any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any

promptly furnish all information concerning such Party, its Subsidiaries,
Representatives and stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested

4.5 Applied Stockholders Meeting; TEL Stockholders Meeting.

 

(a) Applied shall: (i) take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements and its organizational and governing documents to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting (the " _Applied
Stockholders  Meeting_") of the holders of Applied Common Stock to vote on a
proposal to adopt this Agreement, which Applied Stockholders Meeting will be
held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date the Form S-4
Registration/Proxy Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and conditional
upon such declaration of effectiveness); and (ii) submit such proposal to,
and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such
proposal from, such holders at the Applied Stockholders Meeting and, except
for a proposal to adjourn or postpone the Applied Stockholders Meeting as
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements or as otherwise related to the
furtherance of any of the Contemplated Transactions, shall not submit any
other proposal to such holders in connection with the Applied Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of TEL. Applied shall ensure that
all proxies solicited in connection with the Applied Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Applied, after consultation with TEL, may, or, if requested by TEL,
shall, adjourn or postpone the Applied Stockholders Meeting: (A) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Form S-4
Registration/Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Legal Requirements
is timely provided to Applieds stockholders; (B) if as of the time for which
the Applied Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Applied Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business

 



39  to be conducted at the Applied Stockholders Meeting, in which case, Applied
shall use its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or
adjournment to obtain such a quorum as soon as reasonably practicable; or (C)
if additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Business Combination and the
other Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b) With respect to the Applied Stockholders Meeting, and subject to Section
4.5(c): (i) the Form S-4 Registration/Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Applied Board recommends that the Applied
stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement (such recommendation of the Applied
Board, the " _Applied Board Recommendation_ "); (ii) the Applied Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to TEL;
and (iii) neither the Applied Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A) fail
to reaffirm the Applied Board Recommendation, or fail to publicly state that
the Business Combination (including the Applied Merger) and the other
Contemplated Transactions are in the best interests of Applieds stockholders,
within five Business Days after TEL requests in writing that such action be
taken; (B) fail to issue, within five Business Days after an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to an Applied Entity is publicly announced, a press
release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C)
resolve to take any action described in clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this
sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses "(ii)" and
"(iii)" being referred to as an " _Applied Change in Recommendation_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.5(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required Applied Stockholder Vote, the Applied Board may
effect, or cause Applied to effect, as the case may be, a Applied Change
in Recommendation if:

(i) (A) Applied has not breached its obligations under Section 4.3 in
connection with the offer referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B)
after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written offer to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of Applied Common Stock (whether
through a tender offer, merger or otherwise) is made to Applied and is not
withdrawn; (C) the Applied Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consulting with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such offer constitutes a Superior Offer with respect to Applied; (D) the
Applied Board does not effect, or cause Applied to effect, an Applied Change
in Recommendation at any time within five Business Days after TEL receives
written notice from Applied confirming that the Applied Board has determined,
in its good faith judgment, after consulting with an independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such offer is a Superior Offer with
respect to Applied; (E) during such five Business Day period, if requested by
TEL, Applied engages in good faith negotiations with TEL to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with an independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, to constitute a Superior Offer with respect to Applied
no longer constitutes a Superior Offer with respect to Applied; (F) at the end
of such five Business Day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Offer with respect to Applied (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by TEL as a result
of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the
Applied Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to
make an Applied Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Applied Board under applicable Legal Requirements; or

(ii) (A) a material development or change in circumstances unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal that was neither known to any Applied Entity or any
Representative of any Applied Entity nor reasonably foreseeable to any Applied
Entity as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or change
in circumstances being referred to as an " _Applied_

 



40   _Intervening Event_ ") occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the receipt of the Required Applied Stockholder Vote; (B) the
Applied Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Applied Intervening Event, the
failure to make an Applied Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Applied Board under applicable Legal Requirements;
(C) at least five Business Days prior to effecting an Applied Change in
Recommendation in respect of such Applied Intervening Event, Applied provides
TEL with a written notice of such Applied Intervening Event, including
a reasonably detailed description thereof, and the intention of the Applied
Board to effect an Applied Change in Recommendation as a result thereof; (D)
during such five Business Day period, if requested by TEL, Applied engages in
good faith negotiations with TEL to make such amendments to the terms of this
Agreement or to take such other actions as would obviate the need for the
Applied Board to effect an Applied Change in Recommendation as a result of
such Applied Intervening Event; and (E) following the expiration of such five
Business Day period, the Applied Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Applied
Intervening Event (taking into account the implementation of the amendments
to the terms of this Agreement or other actions proposed by TEL as a result of
the negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)"), the failure to make an Applied
Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Applied Board under applicable Legal Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding any Applied Change in Recommendation, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, this Agreement shall be submitted
to the holders of Applied Common Stock at the Applied Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Business Combination and the other Contemplated Transactions, and
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Applied of such
obligation.

 

(e) TEL shall: (i) take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements and its organizational and governing documents to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold an extraordinary meeting (the " _TEL
Stockholders  Meeting_") of the holders of TEL Common Stock to vote on a
proposal to approve the TEL Merger Agreement, which TEL Stockholders Meeting
will be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the later of the
date (A) the Form S-4 Registration/Proxy Statement is declared effective by
the SEC (and conditional upon such declaration of effectiveness) and (B) the
FSA Registration Statement takes effect under the Financial Instruments and
Exchange Act of Japan; and (ii) submit such proposal to, and use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit votes in favor of such proposal from, such
holders at the TEL Stockholders Meeting and, except for a proposal to adjourn
or postpone the TEL Stockholder Meeting as permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements or as otherwise related to or in furtherance of any of
the Contemplated Transactions, shall not submit any other proposal to such
holders in connection with the TEL Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Applied. TEL shall ensure that all requests for completion
and submission of voting cards made in connection with the TEL Stockholders
Meeting comply with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, TEL, after consultation
with Applied, may, or, if requested by Applied, shall, adjourn or postpone
the TEL Stockholders Meeting: (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the FSA Registration Statement or TEL Convocation
Materials that is required by applicable Legal Requirements is timely
provided to TELs stockholders; (B) if, as of the time for which the TEL
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares
of TEL Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the TEL
Stockholders Meeting in which case, TEL shall use its reasonable best efforts
during any such postponement or adjournment to obtain such a quorum as soon
as practicable; or (C) if additional time is reasonably required to request
voting cards in favor of the approval of the TEL Merger Agreement.

 



41 (f) With respect to the TEL Stockholders Meeting, and subject to Section
4.5(g): (i) the TEL Convocation Materials shall include a statement to the
effect that the TEL Board recommends that the TEL stockholders vote to approve
the TEL Merger Agreement (such recommendation of the TEL Board, the " _TEL
Board Recommendation_ "); (ii) the TEL Board Recommendation shall not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Applied; and (iii) neither the
TEL Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A) fail to reaffirm the TEL Board
Recommendation, or fail to publicly state that the Business Combination
(including the TEL Merger) and the other Contemplated Transactions are in the
best interests of TELs stockholders, within five Business Days after
Applied requests in writing that such action be taken; (B) fail to issue,
within five Business Days after an Acquisition Proposal with respect to a TEL
Entity is publicly announced, a press release announcing its opposition to
such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) resolve to take any action described in
clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions
described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a " _TEL Change
in Recommendation_ ").

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.5(f)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of the TEL
Merger Agreement by the Required TEL Stockholder Vote, the TEL Board may
effect, or cause TEL to effect, as the case may be, a TEL Change in
Recommendation if:

 

(i) (A) TEL has not breached its obligations under Section 4.3 in connection
with the offer referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the date
of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written offer to purchase all of
the outstanding shares of TEL Common Stock (whether through a tender offer,
merger or otherwise) is made to TEL and is not withdrawn; (C) the TEL Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with an independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a
Superior Offer with respect to TEL; (D) the TEL Board does not effect, or
cause TEL to effect, a TEL Change in Recommendation at any time within five
Business Days after Applied receives written notice from TEL confirming that
the TEL Board has determined, in its good faith judgment, after consulting
with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
offer is a Superior Offer with respect to TEL; (E) during such five Business
Day period, if requested by Applied, TEL engages in good faith negotiations
with Applied to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was
determined, in its good faith judgment, after consulting with an independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, to constitute a Superior Offer
with respect to TEL no longer constitutes a Superior Offer with respect to
TEL; (F) at the end of such five Business Day period, such offer has not been
withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Offer with respect to TEL
(taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Applied as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or
otherwise); and (G) the TEL Board determines in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Offer, the failure to make a TEL Change in Recommendation would be a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the TEL Board under applicable Legal Requirements; or

 

(ii) (A) a material development or change in circumstances unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal that was neither known to any TEL Entity or any
Representative of any TEL Entity nor reasonably foreseeable to any TEL Entity
as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or change in
circumstances being referred to as a " _TEL Intervening Event_ ") occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Required TEL Stockholder Vote; (B) the TEL Board determines in good faith,
after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
TEL Intervening Event, the failure to make a TEL Change in Recommendation
would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the TEL Board under applicable
Legal Requirements; (C) at least five Business Days prior to effecting a TEL
Change 

 



42  in Recommendation in respect of such TEL Intervening Event, TEL provides
Applied with a written notice of such TEL Intervening Event, including a
reasonably detailed description thereof, and the intention of the TEL Board
to effect a TEL Change in Recommendation as a result thereof; (D) during such
five Business Day period, if requested by Applied, TEL engages in good faith
negotiations with Applied to make such amendments to the terms of this
Agreement or to take such other actions as would obviate the need for the TEL
Board to effect a TEL Change in Recommendation as a result of such TEL
Intervening Event; and (E) following the expiration of such five Business Day
period, the TEL Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such TEL Intervening Event (taking into
account the implementation of the amendments to the terms of this Agreement or
other actions proposed by Applied as a result of the negotiations
contemplated by clause "(D)"), the failure to make a TEL Change in
Recommendation would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the TEL Board
under applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any TEL Change in Recommendation, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with Section 6.1: (i) the TEL Merger Agreement shall
be submitted to the holders of TEL Common Stock at the TEL Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of the TEL Merger Agreement,
and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve TEL of
such obligation; and (ii) TEL shall ensure that the TEL Merger Agreement shall
not be amended, altered, revoked, rescinded or terminated, and no provision
thereunder shall be waived or caused to be waived by TEL or TEL Merger Sub,
in each case, without the prior written consent of Applied (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however,_
that TEL shall take all actions necessary under the TEL Merger Agreement,
including extending the Effective Date (as defined in the TEL Merger
Agreement) in the manner required by the Companies Act of Japan, to cause the
consummation of the TEL Merger to take place on a date and in a manner to be
designated jointly by Applied and TEL, which shall be (except as otherwise
mutually agreed by Applied and TEL) no later than the 10th Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement (other than the
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

 

(i) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements: (i) each of Applied and TEL
shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Applied
Stockholders Meeting and TEL Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same
date; and (ii) if, notwithstanding such efforts, one such meeting is held
prior to the other, the Party that has not held its meeting shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its meeting to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of the meeting that has been held.

 

4.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) From and after the Business Combination Effective Time, HoldCo shall (and
HoldCo shall cause Applied and TEL to): indemnify and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers
and employees of each Applied Entity and TEL Entity (in all their capacities):
(i) to the same extent the foregoing are indemnified, held harmless or
are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
Applied or TEL or any other Applied Entity or TEL Entity; and (ii) without
limitation of the preceding clause "(i)," to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, in each case, for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Business Combination Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions).

 



43 (b) For a period of six years following the Business Combination Effective
Time, HoldCo shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing policy of
Applieds directors and officers liability insurance (or a comparable
replacement policy) (the " _Applied D andO Policy_") covering claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Business Combination
Effective Time to the extent that such claims are of the type covered by the
Applied DandO Policy (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to
the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by the Applied DandO Policy)
and covering each individual who is covered as of the Business Combination
Effective Time by the Applied DandO Policy, in any case on terms with respect
to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
terms in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall HoldCo be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of
200% of the current annual premium paid by Applied for such insurance (such
200% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Applied Premium_ "); _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Annual Applied Premium, HoldCo shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest comparable coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Applied Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 4.6(b), HoldCo may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
Applied DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less
favorable in the aggregate than the Applied DandO Policy, and in the event that
HoldCo shall purchase such a "tail" policy, HoldCo shall maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of HoldCo under the first
sentence of this Section 4.6(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) For a period of six years following the Business Combination Effective
Time, HoldCo shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing policy of
TELs directors and officers liability insurance (or a comparable
replacement policy) (the " _TEL D andO Policy_") covering claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Business Combination
Effective Time to the extent that such claims are of the type covered by the
TEL DandO Policy (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to the
extent that such acts or omissions are covered by the TEL DandO Policy) and
covering each individual who is covered as of the Business Combination
Effective Time by the TEL DandO Policy, in any case on terms with respect to
coverage and amounts that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
terms in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall HoldCo be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200%
of the current annual premium paid by TEL for such insurance (such 200%
amount, the " _Maximum Annual TEL Premium_ "); _provided further_ , _however_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Applied Premium, HoldCo shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest comparable coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual TEL Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 4.6(c), HoldCo may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
TEL DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable
in the aggregate than the TEL DandO Policy, and in the event that HoldCo shall
purchase such a "tail" policy, HoldCo shall maintain such "tail" policy in
full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of HoldCo under the first sentence of this
Section 4.6(c) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full
force and effect.

 

(d) The obligations under this Section 4.6 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any individual who
is a beneficiary under the Applied DandO Policy, TEL DandO Policy or the "tail"
policies referred to in Section 4.6(b) and 4.6(c) (or any of such individuals
heirs and representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected
beneficiary (and, after the death of such beneficiary, such beneficiarys
heirs and representatives). Each of the individuals who are beneficiaries
under the Applied DandO Policy, TEL DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to
in this Section 4.6 (and, after the death of any of the foregoing individuals,
such individuals heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 4.6, with 

 



44  full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the
applicable employees, officers and directors of Applied and TEL (and other
individuals who are beneficiaries under the Applied DandO Policy, TEL DandO
Policy or the "tail" policies referred to in this Section 4.6) (and their
heirs and representatives) under this Section 4.6 shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such individuals may have
under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by any Applied Entity, TEL Entity, HoldCo or any of its Subsidiaries, or
applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law or in equity).

(e) In the event that HoldCo or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, then in each case, to the extent necessary to
protect the rights of each individual who is a beneficiary under the Applied
DandO Policy, TEL DandO Policy or the "tail" policies referred to in this Section
4.6 (and any of such individuals heirs and representatives), proper
provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable) shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.6.

 

4.7 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

 

(a) Each of Applied and TEL shall use its reasonable best efforts to file (and
to cause the other Applied Entities and other TEL Entities to file), as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such Party with any Governmental Body
with respect to the Business Combination and the other
Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information
requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Applied and TEL shall, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) the
notifications required under any Legal Requirement that is designed to

monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") in
connection with the Business Combination. Each of Applied and TEL shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general,
antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or
related matters. Subject to Section 4.7(e) and Section 4.7(f), each of Applied
and TEL shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to consummate the Business Combination and make
effective the other Contemplated Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.7(a), each of Applied and
TEL shall use its reasonable best efforts to submit a draft joint voluntary
notice and, following the receipt of any comments thereto, a final joint
voluntary notice, to CFIUS (the " _Exon-Florio Filing_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Applied and TEL
shall cooperate in preparing, pre-filing and filing with CFIUS a joint
voluntary notice of the Business Combination in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Applied and TEL shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within the time required to avoid possible rejection or deferred acceptance
of the Exon-Florio Filing under 31 C.F.R. § 800.403) to any inquiries or
requests received from CFIUS in connection with such joint voluntary notice.
Each of Applied and TEL shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
CFIUS Approval; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any Party be
required to take any action (or to cause any of its Affiliates to take any
action) in order to obtain the CFIUS Approval that would (or would reasonably
be expected to) result in a material and adverse impact on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, following the Business Combination Effective Time.

 



45 (c) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Applied and TEL each shall promptly supply the other with any
information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings
(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) Section 4.7(a), Section 4.7(b) or Section 4.7(d).
Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental
Body, and subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, each of Applied and TEL shall (each through its counsel): (i)
consult with the other in good faith prior to taking a position with respect
to any such filing; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any

Proceeding relating to any antitrust, competition or fair trade Legal
Requirement); (iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information; and (iv) promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with
copies of all filings, notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,

Governmental Body related solely to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

(d) Each of Applied and TEL shall (each through its counsel) notify the other
promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any material communication from any
official of any Governmental Body in connection with any filing made pursuant
to this Agreement; (ii) Knowledge of the commencement or threat of
commencement of any Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Body with respect to
the Contemplated Transactions (and shall thereafter keep the other informed as
to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request
by any official of any Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to
comply with any Legal Requirements applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 4.7(a) or
Section 4.7(b), Applied or TEL, as the case may be, shall (promptly upon
learning of the occurrence of such event) inform the other of the occurrence
of such event and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body
such amendment or supplement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that any Legal Proceeding is initiated (or threatened to be
initiated) by a Governmental Body challenging the Business Combination or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions, each of Applied and TEL shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and to contest and
resist any such Legal Proceeding until the entering into by a court of
competent jurisdiction of the first to occur of any preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order that preliminarily or permanently prohibits,
prevents or restricts the consummation of the Business Combination or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions. Neither Applied nor TEL shall make (or
permit any of its Affiliates to make) any offer, acceptance or counter-offer
to, or agreement with, any Governmental Body with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment, remedy, discovery, admissibility of
evidence, timing or scheduling, in any case with respect to any
Legal Proceeding initiated by a Governmental Body related to the Business
Combination or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, without the consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.7 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Applied nor TEL shall have any
obligation under this Agreement or in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions to: (i) dispose of, transfer or exclusively license, or cause any
of its Subsidiaries to dispose of, transfer or exclusively license, any
assets to any Person (other than Applied or TEL), or to commit to (or cause
any of its Subsidiaries to commit to) dispose of, transfer or exclusively
license any assets to any Person (other than Applied or TEL); (ii) discontinue
or cause any 

 



46  of its Subsidiaries to discontinue, or commit to (or cause any of its

Subsidiaries to non-exclusively license or otherwise make available, to any
Person (other than Applied or TEL) any technology, Intellectual Property or

operations; or (v) make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any
commitment, or to commit to (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to commit to)
make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its
future operations or the future operations of any of its Subsidiaries; 
_provided, however,_ that Applied and TEL shall be required to take (and to
cause their Subsidiaries to take) the actions set forth in clauses "(i)"
through "(v)" of this Section 4.7(f) if, but only if, such
actions, considered collectively, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Substantial Detriment. Such actions shall be deemed to result in a "
_Substantial Detriment_ " if such actions, considered collectively, are
reasonably expected to result in a reduction of the combined annual
consolidated revenues of the Applied Entities and the TEL Entities,
collectively, of at least $600,000,000 (using the applicable revenues of the
Applied Entities for Applieds 2012 fiscal year and the applicable revenues
of the TEL Entities for TELs 2012 fiscal year in determining whether the
threshold set forth in this sentence is reasonably expected to be exceeded).

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
the foregoing: (i) each of Applied and TEL may, without such consultation or

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.9(f), each of Applied and TEL
shall: (i) use its reasonable best efforts to file or submit, or cause to be
filed or submitted, in each case, within 15 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, initial Tax Submissions with the Specified Japanese Tax

End Date_ "), HoldCo shall ensure that, so long as the applicable Person
remains employed by HoldCo or one of its Subsidiaries, each Person who was an
employee of an Applied Entity immediately prior to the Applied
Merger Effective Time (an " _Applied Continuing Employee_ ") or who was an
employee of a TEL Entity immediately prior to the TEL Merger Effective Time (a
" _TEL Continuing Employee_ " and all TEL Continuing Employees together
with all Applied Continuing Employees, collectively, the " _HoldCo Employees_
"), shall receive compensation and benefits (excluding equity-based benefits)
that are not less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
benefits that were provided to such HoldCo Employee immediately prior to the
Applied Merger Effective Time or the TEL Merger Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.15(a),
HoldCo shall ensure that each HoldCo Employee whose employment terminates
upon or prior to the Benefit End Date receives severance payments and benefits

applicable.

 



50 (c) HoldCo shall ensure that each HoldCo Employee receives full credit for his
or her years of service with Applied, TEL, their respective Subsidiaries, and
all of their respective predecessors (to the same extent as such HoldCo
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Applied Merger Effective Time
or the TEL Merger Effective Time, as applicable) for all purposes (including
purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, and level of benefits) under
the Employee Plans and other compensation and benefit plans, programs,
policies, agreements and arrangements of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries
following the Closing in which such HoldCo Employee is eligible to
participate; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.

(d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including Section 4.1), each of
Applied and TEL shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of their
respective Representatives, including legal, human resources and
regulatory, to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by the Parties
in connection with satisfying any legal obligations, including all

the Contemplated Transactions without such opinion or acknowledgment. Such
cooperation shall include the provision of any information and consultation
required by applicable Legal Requirements, the terms of any Contract or
Employee Plan, or as reasonably requested by another Party. Applied and TEL
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available
their Representatives at such times and in such places as the other may
reasonably request for purposes of discussions with Representatives of any
such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

 

(e) This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Parties and is not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude HoldCo or any of its Subsidiaries, at
any time after the Closing, from amending, merging, modifying, terminating,
eliminating, reducing, or otherwise altering in any respect any Employee Plan,
any benefit under any Employee Plan, any trust, insurance policy or funding
vehicle related to any Employee Plan or any other compensation, benefit or
third-party insurance plan, program, policy, practice, Contract, agreement or
fund of HoldCo or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute an amendment, modification or termination of any
compensation, benefit or third-party insurance plan, program, policy,
practice, Contract, agreement or fund.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an Employee Plan
or any other employee benefit arrangement, or create any right or obligation
which is enforceable by any current or former Applied or TEL employee, any
HoldCo Employee, or any other Person, with respect to continued employment or
any terms or conditions of employment, including the benefits
and compensation described in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amendments to any Employee Plan or any other compensation, benefit or third-
party insurance plan, program, policy, practice, Contract, agreement or fund
of Applied, TEL, HoldCo, or any of their Subsidiaries shall occur only in
accordance with their respective terms and shall be pursuant to action taken
by Applied or TEL, or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, which are
independent of the consummation of this Agreement or any continuing
obligations hereunder.

disregarded. It is understood and agreed that (a) nothing in the Applied
Disclosure Schedule or TEL Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation, warranty, covenant or condition of Applied or
TEL, as applicable, made herein and (b) neither the specifications of any

thereof to any Person or any circumstance, that is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions are not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. To such end, the provisions of
this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any
term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

(including with respect to the particularities of the Implementation
Schedule, Corporate Governance Structure, TEL Intended Tax Treatment, the
intended U.S. tax treatment under Section 7874 of the Code, and the intended
tax treatment of the transactions set forth on the Implementation
Schedule) exactly as described in this Agreement and the Implementation
Schedule, or the Parties receive an Adverse Japanese Tax Ruling or are unable
to obtain the Tax Opinions related to the TEL Intended Tax Treatment, due to
any event, cause, circumstance, condition or reason (collectively, "
_Consummation Impediments_ "), then each of Applied and TEL agree to cooperate
and negotiate in good faith with one another and to use its reasonable best
efforts, in each case, up to the earlier of the End Date (as it may be
extended pursuant to Section 6.1(b)) or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6, to agree upon changes to the Contemplated Transactions
(and, correlatively, this Agreement, the Implementation Schedule, and the
other agreements setting forth the terms and conditions of the Contemplated
Transactions) that would

 



62  permit the elimination of any Adverse Japanese Tax Ruling or the
consummation of the business combination of Applied and TEL while concurrently
preserving the form and substance of, and the intended balances and other
intentions motivating, the Contemplated Transactions to the maximum extent
possible in light of the Consummation Impediments.

 

(c) Nothing set forth in Section 7.12(a) or 7.12(b) shall be deemed to limit,
modify, waive, amend, or otherwise adversely affect any Partys rights under
Section 6\.

7.13 Construction.

shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.

 

(b) The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation, drafting, preparation and execution of this Agreement, and
therefore, agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(d) The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires.

(e) The word "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase
"and/or."

 

(f) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement.

(g) The bold-faced headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement

provisions of this Agreement.

(h) All references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United

Street Journal, on each of the 20 Business Days immediately preceding (but not
including) the date of this Agreement.
