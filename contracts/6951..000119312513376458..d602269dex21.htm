&#147;Company&#148;) or Tokyo Electron Limited (&#147;TEL&#148;). In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties and certain covenants contained in the Agreement are qualified by information in confidential Disclosure
Schedules provided by each of the Company and TEL to the other in connection with the signing of the Agreement. These confidential Disclosure Schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and
warranties and certain covenants set forth in the Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and TEL rather than establishing matters as facts.
Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company or TEL. </P>
