-iv-      COMBINATION AGREEMENT   THIS COMBINATION AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") is entered into effective as of February 7, 2001, between
Calpine Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("CCo"), and Encal Energy Ltd.,
an Alberta corporation ("ECo").   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the respective
boards of directors of CCo and ECo each deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders to combine their respective
businesses by CCo, through CCo Sub (as hereinafter defined), acquiring common
shares of ECo pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement (as hereinafter
defined).   WHEREAS, in furtherance of such combination, the respective
boards of directors of CCo and ECo have approved the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the board of directors of ECo has agreed
to submit the Plan of Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated
hereby to its shareholders and optionholders (together, "securityholders")
and the Court of Queen\'s Bench of Alberta (the "Court") for approval.  
WHEREAS, it is intended that the transactions contemplated hereby will be
treated as a "pooling of interests" under United States generally
accepted accounting principles.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:   ARTICLE 1  GENERAL  1.1 PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT   As promptly as
practicable after the Proxy Circular (as hereinafter defined) is prepared,
ECo will apply to the Court pursuant to Section 186 of the Business
Corporations Act (Alberta) (the "ABCA") for an interim order in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to CCo (the "Interim Order") providing for,
among other things, the calling and holding of the ECo Shareholders
Meeting (as hereinafter defined) for the purpose of considering and, if
deemed advisable, approving the arrangement (the "Arrangement") under Section
186 of the ABCA and pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement substantially in the form of Exhibit A (the "Plan of
Arrangement"). If the ECo securityholders approve the Arrangement, ECo will
take the necessary steps to submit the Arrangement to the Court and apply for
a final order of the Court approving the Arrangement in such fashion as the
Court may direct (the "Final Order"). At 12:01 a.m. (the "Effective Time") on
the date (the "Effective Date") shown on the articles of arrangement filed
with the Registrar under the ABCA (which articles of arrangement will not be
filed with the Registrar under the ABCA during any 15 business day cure
period referred to in Section 6.1 (b) or (c) hereof) giving effect to the
Arrangement and other transactions set out in clauses (a) through (d),
inclusive, of Section 2.1 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Arrangement and
such other transactions shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the order
set out therein without any further act or formality.   -2-   1.2
EXCHANGE RATIO   (a) Pursuant, and subject, to the Plan of Arrangement, each
of the  outstanding common shares of ECo will be exchanged for a number  of
Exchangeable Shares (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement)  equal to Cdn.
$12.00 divided by the CCo Average Price (as defined  in the Plan of
Arrangement). This number will be determined by  the parties based on the
foregoing formula prior to the Effective  Time and will, before the articles
of arrangement are filed with  the Registrar under the ABCA, be inserted in
the filed copy of  the Plan of Arrangement in place of the "bullet" and the
"Note to  Draft" in the definition of "Exchange Ratio" in the Plan of 
Arrangement attached hereto as Exhibit A.   (b) The Exchange Ratio (as
defined in the Plan of Arrangement) shall  be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split,  reverse stock split, dividend (including any
dividend or  distribution of cash, property, stock or securities
convertible  into CCo Common Stock (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement)
or  ECo Common Shares (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement)),  merger,
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change  with respect to CCo
Common Stock or ECo Common Shares occurring  after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time.   (c) Options to purchase ECo Common Shares will be
treated in the  manner described in the Plan of Arrangement.  1.3
DISSENTING SHARES   Holders of ECo Common Shares and options to acquire ECo
Common Shares ("ECo Options") may exercise rights of dissent with respect to
such shares in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner
set forth in Section 184 of the ABCA and Section 3.1 of the Plan of
Arrangement (such holders referred to as "Dissenters" or as "Dissenting
Shareholders" when referring exclusively to ECo Shareholders). ECo shall give
CCo (i) prompt notice of any written demands of a right of dissent,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
ABCA and received by ECo and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such rights. Without the prior
written consent of CCo, except as required by applicable law, ECo shall not
make any payment with respect to any such rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.  1.4 OTHER EFFECTS OF THE ARRANGEMENT   At the Effective
Time: (a) each ECo Common Share and each ECo Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged as provided in the Plan of
Arrangement; and (b) the Arrangement will, from and after the Effective Time,
have all of the effects provided by applicable law, including the
ABCA.  1.5 PROXY CIRCULAR; REGISTRATION STATEMENTS   (a) As promptly as
practicable after execution of this Agreement, CCo  and ECo shall prepare a
management information circular (the  "Proxy Circular") of ECo with respect
to the meeting of  securityholders of ECo relating to the Arrangement and  
-3-    the approval of certain matters in connection therewith (the "ECo 
Shareholders Meeting"). As promptly as practicable after the  Proxy Circular
is prepared and the Interim Order granted, ECo  shall cause the Proxy
Circular to be mailed to each of ECo\'s  securityholders entitled to vote at
the ECo Shareholders Meeting.  As promptly as practicable, CCo shall prepare
and file (i) a  registration statement on Form S-3 (the "S-3 Registration 
Statement") with the United States Securities and Exchange  Commission (the
"SEC") to register the CCo Common Stock to be  issued from time to time after
the Effective Time upon exchange  of the exchangeable shares to be issued by
CCo Sub (as defined  hereafter) as contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement
(the  "Exchangeable Shares") and CCo shall use its reasonable best  efforts
to cause the S-3 Registration Statement to become  effective prior to the
Closing, and (ii) a registration statement  on Form S-8 (the "S-8
Registration Statement" and together with  the S-3 Registration Statement,
the "Registration Statements")  with the SEC to register the CCo Common Stock
to be issued from  time to time after the Effective Time upon exercise of
New  Options (as defined hereafter). If such Registration Statements  become
effective, CCo will use its reasonable best efforts to  maintain the
effectiveness of the S-3 Registration Statement for  so long as any
Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding and the S-8  Registration Statement
for so long as any New Options remain  outstanding or, in each case, until
such earlier time as CCo  determines to be sufficient on the written advice
of its outside  counsel.   (b) Each party shall promptly furnish to the
other party all  information concerning such party and its securityholders as
may  be reasonably required in connection with any action contemplated  by
this Section 1.5. The Proxy Circular and the Registration  Statements shall
comply in all material respects with all  applicable requirements of law.
Whenever any event occurs which  should, in the opinion of CCo, be set forth
in an amendment or  supplement to a Registration Statement, ECo shall
promptly  provide information reasonably requested by CCo to enable CCo to 
file with the SEC such amendment or supplement. Whenever any  event occurs
which should, in the opinion of ECo, be set forth in  an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Circular, CCo shall  promptly provide information
reasonably requested by ECo to  enable ECo to prepare and file such amendment
or supplement.   (c) CCo and ECo shall take any action required to be taken
under any  applicable provincial or state securities laws (including "blue 
sky" laws) in connection with the issuance of the CCo Common  Stock and the
Arrangement; provided, however, that with respect  to any such laws, neither
CCo nor ECo shall be required to  register or qualify as a foreign
corporation or reporting issuer  where any such entity is not now so
registered or qualified  except as to matters and transactions arising solely
from the  offer and sale of the CCo Common Stock or the issuance of the 
Exchangeable Shares.   -4-   1.6 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT   In this
Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" used with respect to any party
means any event, change or effect that is or would reasonably be expected to
be materially adverse to the financial condition, operations, assets,
liabilities, or business of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, provided that:   (a) a Material Adverse Effect shall not include
any adverse effect  resulting from (i) any decline in crude oil, natural gas,
gas  liquids or electrical power prices on a current or forward basis,  (ii)
changes in general economic, financial, currency exchange,  securities or
commodity market conditions in the United States or  elsewhere, or (iii) the
drilling, completion or testing after the  date hereof of any wells, where
the drilling of such wells  commenced after January 1, 2001, establishing
that any such wells  or the related prospects are not commercially viable or
are less  successful than anticipated by ECo; and   (b) a Material Adverse
Effect shall, notwithstanding (a) above,  include a change in law or
regulation or in the application of  law or regulation that is or would
reasonably be expected to be  materially adverse as aforesaid.  1.7
CURRENCY   Unless otherwise specified, all references in this Agreement
to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States dollars.  1.8 CCO SUB   (a)
On or prior to the Effective Date, CCo shall cause a new or,  subject to the
consent of ECo, not to be unreasonably withheld,  an existing corporation
under the ABCA ("CCo Sub") to include the  following provisions in its
articles of incorporation:   (i) a class of exchangeable shares (the
"Exchangeable  Shares"), unlimited in number and having the terms and 
conditions set forth in Exhibit B; and   (ii) those other provisions set
forth in Exhibit B.   (b) CCo shall cause CCo Sub to complete the
transactions contemplated  herein.  1.9 EXHIBITS   The following Exhibits

herewith (the "ECo Disclosure Letter"), ECo hereby represents and warrants
to, and agrees with, CCo that:  2.1 ORGANIZATION AND STANDING   ECo and
each body corporate, partnership, joint venture, association or other
business entity of which more than 50% of the total voting power of shares of
stock or units of ownership or beneficial interest entitled to vote in
the election of directors (or members of a comparable governing body) is

and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or organization authorized
to do business in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties

ECo Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list, as at the date hereof, of
the ECo Subsidiaries and the percentage of each subsidiary\'s outstanding
capital stock or other ownership interest owned by ECo or another ECo
Subsidiary.  2.2 AGREEMENT AUTHORIZED AND ITS EFFECT ON OTHER

similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors\'  rights
generally, (ii) general equitable principles, and (iii)  the qualifications
that the consummation of the Arrangement is  subject to   -6-

performance of this Agreement  or the Arrangement by ECo, nor the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by ECo nor
compliance  with the provisions hereof or thereof by ECo will: (i) conflict 
with, or result in any violations of, the articles of  amalgamation or bylaws
of ECo or any equivalent document of any  of the ECo Subsidiaries; or (ii)
result in any breach of or cause  a default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both)  under, give rise to a right of termination, amendment, 
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation contained in, or  the loss of
any benefit or the incurrence of any cost (including,  but not limited to,

interest of any other person (collectively, an  "Encumbrance") upon any of
the properties or assets of ECo or any  of the ECo Subsidiaries under, any
term, condition or provision  of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture,  lease or other agreement, judgment, order, decree,
statute, law,  ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to ECo or any of the
ECo  Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than  any
such breaches, defaults, rights, losses, or Encumbrances  which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a  Material Adverse Effect on ECo.  2.3
GOVERNMENTAL AND THIRD PARTY CONSENTS   (a) No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration,  declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or  commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality,  domestic or foreign (each a "Governmental Entity"), is
required  to be obtained by ECo or any of the ECo Subsidiaries in 
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or  the Plan of
Arrangement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby or
thereby, except for: (i) the filing with  the applicable Canadian provincial
securities commissions or  regulatory authorities (the "Commissions"), the

relating  to the ECo Shareholders Meeting; (ii) the furnishing to the SEC 
of such reports and information under the Exchange Act and the  rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder, as may  be required in

other  documents as required by the ABCA; (iv) such filings,

notice, filings, orders and  approvals as may be necessary under the Public

legislation  in other applicable provinces; and (viii) where the failure to 
obtain such consents, approvals, etc., would not prevent or delay  the
consummation of the Arrangement or otherwise prevent ECo from  performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not  reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on ECo.   (b) Other than as contemplated by
Section 2.3(a), no consents,  assignments, waivers, authorizations or other
certificates from  third parties are necessary or required in connection with
the  transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the continuation  in
full force and effect of all of ECo\'s material contracts or  leases or for
ECo to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby, except when the
failure to receive such consents or other  certificates would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on ECo.  2.4 CAPITALIZATION   (a) The authorized
capital of ECo consists of an unlimited number of  common shares ("ECo Common
Shares"), an unlimited number of Class  A preferred shares issuable in series
and an unlimited number of  Class B preferred shares issuable in series
(collectively, the  "Preferred Shares"). As of February 6, 2001, 109,857,279
ECo  Common Shares were issued and outstanding and no Preferred Shares  are
issued and outstanding. As of February 6, 2001, an aggregate  of 7,294,981
ECo Common Shares were reserved for issuance  pursuant to outstanding ECo
Options granted under the Stock  Option Plan of ECo (the "ECo Option Plan")
and, as at such date,  no other ECo Shares are reserved for issuance pursuant
to any  outstanding rights or options and no Preferred Shares are  reserved
for issuance. The board of directors of ECo will not  take any action to
amend or to cause the early vesting of any of  the ECo Options other than in
accordance with pre-existing rights  of the holders thereof. All of the
issued and outstanding ECo  Common Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued, are  fully paid and non-assessable, were not issued in
violation of  the terms of any agreement or other understanding binding
upon  ECo and were issued in compliance with all applicable charter 
documents of ECo and all applicable federal, provincial and  foreign
securities laws, rules and regulations. There are, and  have been, no
preemptive rights with respect to the issuance of  the ECo Common Shares or
any other capital stock of ECo.   (b) Other than as set forth above, there
are no outstanding  subscriptions, options, warrants, convertible securities,
calls,  commitments, agreements or rights (contingent or otherwise) of  any
character to purchase or otherwise acquire from ECo any  shares of, or any
securities convertible into, the capital stock  of ECo.   -8-    (c) ECo
does not have a shareholders rights protection plan or  similar plan or
agreement.  2.5 SECURITIES REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BOOKS AND
RECORDS   (a) ECo has filed all forms, reports, annual reports and
documents  with the Commissions required to be filed by it pursuant to 
relevant Canadian securities statutes, regulations, policies and  rules
(collectively, the "ECo Canadian Securities Reports"), all  of which have
complied in all material respects with all  applicable requirements of such
statutes, regulations, policies  and rules. None of the ECo Canadian
Securities Reports, at the  time filed or as subsequently amended, contained
any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the 
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under  which they were
made, not misleading. The financial statements of  ECo contained in the ECo
Canadian Securities Reports complied in  all material respects with the then
applicable accounting  requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the  relevant Canadian securities statutes with respect thereto, were 
prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted  accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the  periods involved (except
as may have been indicated in the notes  thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by  applicable laws, rules or regulations) and
fairly present in all  material respects (subject, in the case of the
unaudited  statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments) the 
consolidated financial position of ECo and its consolidated ECo  Subsidiaries
as at the respective dates thereof and the  consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the  respective periods then ended.   (b) ECo
has filed all annual and quarterly reports and (except for  any immaterial
matters) all other forms, reports and documents  with the SEC required to be
filed by it pursuant to relevant  United States securities statutes,
regulations, policies and  rules (collectively, the "ECo United States
Securities Reports";  and together with the ECo Canadian Securities Reports,
the "ECo  Securities Reports"), all of which have complied in all material 
respects with all applicable requirements of such statutes,  regulations,
policies and rules. None of the ECo United States  Securities Reports, at the
time filed or as subsequently amended  or supplemented, contained any untrue
statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements made 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were  made, not
misleading. The financial statements of ECo contained  in the ECo United
States Securities Reports complied in all  material respects with the then
applicable accounting  requirements and the published rules and regulations
under the  relevant United States securities statutes with respect thereto, 
were prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted  accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the  periods involved (except
as may have been indicated in the notes  thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by  applicable laws, rules or regulations) and
fairly present in all  material respects (subject, in the case of the
unaudited  statements, to normal, year-end audit   -9-    adjustments)
the consolidated financial position of ECo and its  consolidated ECo
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof  and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows  for the respective periods then
ended.   (c) There has been no change in ECo\'s accounting policies or the 
methods of making accounting estimates or changes in estimates  that are
material to such financial statements, except as  described in the notes
thereto.  2.6 LIABILITIES   Neither ECo nor any ECo Subsidiary has any
material liabilities or obligations, either accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise, or has any knowledge of any potential material liabilities or
obligations, other than those disclosed in the ECo Securities Reports or
incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2000.  2.7
INFORMATION SUPPLIED   None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
ECo for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Circular will,
at the time the Proxy Circular is mailed to the securityholders of ECo or at
the time of the ECo Shareholders Meeting contain any untrue statement which,
at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a
proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or
misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by ECo for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in a Registration Statement will at
the time such Registration Statement is declared or becomes effective contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

air,  groundwater, surface water, soil, or other environmental media;  (ii)

the environment; or (iii) the regulation of any  pollutants, contaminants,

individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material  Adverse
Effect on ECo;   (d) To the knowledge of ECo, none of the operations or
assets of ECo  or any ECo Subsidiary has ever been conducted or used by ECo

Effect on ECo or have been  rectified;   (e) No written notice has been
served on ECo or any ECo Subsidiary  from any entity, governmental agency or

either individually or in the aggregate, do not and are not expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on ECo.  2.18 TAXES   Except with

-15-   2.20 BROKERS AND FINDERS   Other than Merrill Lynch in accordance
with the terms of its engagement letter dated January 3, 2001, a copy of
which has been provided to CCo, none of ECo or any of the ECo Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees,
brokerage fees, commissions or similar payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The ECo Disclosure Letter
attaches a copy of the engagement letter and such letter includes a
description of all of the fees and other financial obligations and
commitments of ECo\'s engagement arrangement with Merrill Lynch.  2.21
DISCLOSURE   No representation or warranty made by ECo in this Agreement or
the ECo Disclosure Letter, nor any document, written information, written
statement, financial statement, certificate or Exhibit prepared and furnished
or to be prepared and furnished by ECo or its representatives pursuant hereto
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken
together, contains or contained (as of the date made) any untrue statement of
a material fact when made, or omits or omitted (as of the date made) to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements or facts contained herein or
therein not misleading, in any material way, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, except for such untrue statements or omissions
(other than any in the representations or warranties made by ECo in this
Agreement or the ECo Disclosure Letter) which were not intentional, and
which, either individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect on Eco.  2.22 FAIRNESS OPINION   ECo\'s board of directors
has received an opinion as of February 6, 2001 (and have been advised that
they will receive a written opinion) from Merrill Lynch that the Plan of
Arrangement is fair from a financial point of view to ECo securityholders
(the "ECo Fairness Opinion").  2.23 RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES  
There is no material agreement, judgment, injunction, order or court decree
binding upon ECo or any ECo Subsidiary that has or could reasonably
be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
current business practice of ECo or any ECo Subsidiary, any acquisition of
property by ECo or any ECo Subsidiary, the conduct of any current business by
ECo or any ECo Subsidiary or the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.  2.24 BOOKS AND RECORDS   The books, records and accounts of
ECo and the ECo Subsidiaries: (a) have been maintained in accordance with
good business practices on a basis consistent with prior years; (b) are
stated in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of ECo and the ECo Subsidiaries,
and (c) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the ECo financial
statements. ECo has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (x) transactions
are executed in   -16-   accordance with management\'s general or
specific authorization; and (y) transactions are recorded as necessary (i) to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to
such statements and (ii) to maintain accountability for assets.  2.25
POOLING MATTERS   Neither ECo nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in
Section 7.6) or the ECo Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action
that, without giving effect to any action taken or agreed to be taken by CCo
or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, would prevent CCo from accounting
for the business combination to be effected by the Arrangement on a pooling
of interests accounting basis under United States generally accepted
accounting principles. ECo\'s board of directors has received written advice,
a copy of which has been provided to CCo, from Ernst and Young LLP that they
are not presently aware of any matters which, in the opinion of Ernst and Young
LLP, would prevent CCo from accounting for the business combination to be
effected by the Arrangement on such pooling of interests accounting basis
under United States generally accepted accounting principles. Neither ECo nor
any of the ECo Subsidiaries have any reason to believe that the business
combination to be effected by the Arrangement cannot qualify as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes under United States generally accepted
accounting principles.  2.26 ENGINEERING REPORT   ECo has provided to
Gilbert Lausten Jung Associates Ltd. ("Gilbert"), independent geological and
petroleum engineering consultants, all material information concerning land
descriptions and well data which is in ECo\'s possession or control
respecting the oil and gas assets of ECo evaluated by Gilbert in the Gilbert
Report prepared effective December 31, 2000, a copy of which has been
provided to CCo and, in particular, all material information respecting
ECo\'s interests in such oil and gas assets and the royalty burdens and net
profits interest burdens thereon and ECo is not aware, after due enquiry, of
any information not provided to Gilbert that would have a material adverse
impact on the Gilbert Report, taken as a whole and none of the oil and gas
assets to which Alberta Royalty Tax Credits were attributed in the
Gilbert Report is a "restricted resource property".  2.27 UNITED STATES
OPERATIONS   Direct sales by ECo, if any, into the United States in calendar
year 2000 were less than $25 million (U.S.) in the aggregate and the assets
of ECo located in the United States, if any, have an aggregate value less
than $15 million (U.S.).  2.28 INSURANCE   Policies of insurance are in
force as of the date hereof naming ECo and the ECo Subsidiaries as insureds
which adequately cover all risks as are customarily covered by oil and gas
producers in the industry in which ECo and the ECo Subsidiaries operate. All
such policies shall remain in force and effect and shall not be canceled or
otherwise terminated as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   -17-   2.29 OPERATIONS   To ECo\'s knowledge, all
operations in respect of ECo and the ECo Subsidiaries, including without
limitation the drilling, completion, operations and abandonment of wells and
production marketing and transportation, have been and will be conducted in
accordance with good oilfield practices in all material respects.   ARTICLE

ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to CCo or any of the CCo 
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than  any such
breaches, defaults, rights, losses, or Encumbrances  which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a  Material Adverse Effect on CCo.  3.3

transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the continuation  in full

Reports, at the time filed or as subsequently amended or supplemented,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The financial statements of CCo contained in the
CCo Securities Reports complied in all material respects with the then
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
under the relevant United States securities statutes with respect thereto,
were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may have been indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by applicable laws, rules or regulations) and fairly
present in all material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments) the consolidated financial
position of CCo and its consolidated CCo Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the respective periods then ended. There has been no change in CCo\'s
accounting policies or the methods of making accounting estimates or changes
in estimates that are material to such financial statements, except as
described in the notes thereto.  3.6 MATERIAL LIABILITIES   CCo and the
CCo Subsidiaries have properly disclosed in the CCo Securities Reports all
material liabilities of CCo and the CCo Subsidiaries required to be disclosed
therein.  3.7 INFORMATION SUPPLIED   None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by CCo for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Circular will, at the time the Proxy Circular is mailed to the
shareholders of ECo and at the time of the ECo Securityholders Meeting, as
may be adjourned from time to time, contain any untrue statement which, at
the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false
or misleading with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a
proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or
misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by CCo for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in a Registration Statement will
at the time such Registration Statement is declared or becomes effective
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   -21-   3.8 NO DEFAULTS   Neither CCo nor any
CCo Subsidiary is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage
of time, in default or violation of any term, condition or provision of: (a)
its charter documents or bylaws; (b) any judgment, decree or order applicable
to it; or (c) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument to which CCo or any
CCo Subsidiary is now a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets may be bound, except in the case of items (b) and (c) for defaults and
violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on CCo.  3.9 LITIGATION; INVESTIGATIONS   There is no
claim, action, suit or proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of CCo
threatened against CCo or any of the CCo Subsidiaries, which would, if
adversely determined, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on CCo, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against CCo or any
of the CCo Subsidiaries having, or which, insofar as reasonably can
be foreseen, in the future could have, any such effect. There is no
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of CCo, threatened, against CCo or
any of the CCo Subsidiaries before any Governmental Entity which could have
such effect.  3.10 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES AND EVENTS   Since September
30, 2000, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on CCo that has not
been publicly disclosed in accordance with applicable laws, widely reported
to the general public in the United States or otherwise disclosed in the CCo
Securities Reports.  3.11 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS   Neither CCo nor any CCo
Subsidiary is in violation of or in default with respect to, or in alleged
violation of or alleged default with respect to any other applicable law or
any applicable rule or regulation, or any writ or decree of any court or any
governmental commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, or
delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity, except for violations, defaults and delinquencies which,
either individually or in the aggregate, do not and are not expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect on CCo.  3.12 BROKERS AND
FINDERS   Other than Goldman, Sachs and Co., Scotia Capital Inc. and Ernst and
Young Corporate Finance Inc., none of CCo or any of the CCo Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective directors, officers or employees has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees,
brokerage fees, commissions or similar payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   -22-   3.13
DISCLOSURE   No representation or warranty made by CCo in this Agreement,
nor any document, written information, written statement, financial
statement, certificate or Exhibit prepared and furnished or to be prepared
and furnished by CCo or its representatives pursuant hereto or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken together, contains or
contained (as of the date made) any untrue statement of a material fact when
made, or omits or omitted (as of the date made) to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements or facts contained herein or therein not
misleading, in any material way, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, except for such untrue statements or omissions (other than
any in the representations or warranties made by CCo in this Agreement) which
were not intentional and which, either individually or in the aggregate, do
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on CCo.  3.14 CCO SUB   CCo Sub
will be incorporated or will continue solely for the purpose of participating
in the transactions contemplated herein and, through the Effective Time, will
carry on no other business (except that CCo Sub may own shares in other
indirect Canadian subsidiaries of CCo), and, except as contemplated herein or
in any other document related to the transactions contemplated herein,
will not have any liabilities or obligations, either accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise as of the Effective Time.  3.15 POOLING MATTERS  
Neither CCo nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in Section 7.6) or the CCo
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that, without
giving effect to any action taken or agreed to be taken by ECo or any of its
affiliates or ECo Subsidiaries, would prevent CCo from accounting for the
business combination to be effected by the Arrangement on a pooling of
interests accounting basis under United States generally accepted accounting
principles. CCo\'s board of directors has received written advice, a copy of
which has been provided to ECo, from Arthur Andersen LLP that they are not
presently aware of any matters which, in the opinion of Arthur Andersen LLP,
would prevent CCo from accounting for the business combination to be effected
by the Arrangement on such pooling of interests accounting basis under United
States generally accepted accounting principles. Neither CCo nor any of the
CCo Subsidiaries have any reason to believe that the business combination to
be effected by the Arrangement cannot qualify as a pooling of interests for
accounting purposes under United States generally accepted accounting
principles.  3.16 OWNERSHIP OF ECO SHARES   Neither CCo nor any of its
affiliates own any ECo Common Shares, and neither CCo nor any of its
affiliates will acquire any ECo Common Shares prior to the Effective
Time.  3.17 TITLE TO PROPERTIES   Except as shall be disclosed publicly by
CCo in accordance with applicable law or in the CCo Securities Reports and
except for assets and other property sold, used or otherwise disposed  
-23-   of by CCo since September 30, 2000 in the ordinary course of
business for fair value, CCo and the CCo Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to all real properties and all other properties and assets
owned by them, in each case free from liens, encumbrances and defects that
would materially affect the value thereof or materially interfere with the
use made or to be made thereof by them (other than liens in favor of banks
and other financing parties); and except as shall be disclosed publicly by
CCo in accordance with applicable law or in the CCo Securities Reports, CCo
and the CCo Subsidiaries hold any leased real or personal property under
valid and enforceable leases with no exceptions that would materially
interfere with the use made or to be made thereof by them and except for
encumbrances and defects or exemptions which individually or in the aggregate
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on CCo.  3.18 ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS   Except as shall be disclosed publicly by CCo in accordance
with applicable law or in the CCo Securities Reports, neither CCo nor any of
the CCo Subsidiaries is in violation of any statute, any rule, regulation,
decision or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic
or foreign, relating to the use, disposal or release of hazardous or toxic
substances or relating to the protection or restoration of the environment or
human exposure to hazardous or toxic substances (collectively, "Environmental
Laws"), owns or operates any real property contaminated with any substance
that is subject to any Environmental Laws, is liable for any off-site
disposal or contamination pursuant to any Environmental Laws, or is subject
to any claim relating to any Environmental Laws, which violation,
contamination, liability or claim would individually or in the aggregate have
a Material Adverse Effect on CCo; and CCo has no knowledge of any pending
investigation which might lead to such a claim.  3.19 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS   Except as set forth in the CCo Securities Reports, all material
employee benefits plans ("CCo Plans") covering current or former employees of
CCo and the CCo Subsidiaries have been maintained and administered in
material compliance with their terms and:   (a) all material contributions
and reserves or premium payments  required to be made to the CCo Plans have
been made or provided  for;   (b) each CCo Plan that is required to be
registered or approved by a  governmental agency or authority has been so
registered or  approved and to the knowledge of CCo, nothing has occurred
since  the date of the last registration or approval to adversely affect 
registration or approval; and   (c) to the knowledge of CCo, there are no
pending or anticipated  material claims against any of the CCo Plans and no
suit, action  or other litigation has been brought against any CCo Plan 
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of  operation
of the CCo Plans).   -24-    ARTICLE 4  OBLIGATIONS PENDING EFFECTIVE

with the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement.

change or effect having a Material  Adverse Effect on such party; and (iii)
of any breach by such  party of any material covenant or agreement contained

satisfied  as soon as reasonably practicable all the conditions precedent 
that are set forth in Article 5 hereof, and each of CCo and ECo  will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Arrangement and  the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be  consummated as soon as reasonably
practicable;   (e) Subject to Section 5.4, each of CCo and ECo covenants and
agrees  that it will use its reasonable best efforts (including, without 
limitation, investigations and consultations with its  professional advisors)
such that it and its Affiliates (as  defined in Section 7.6) will not take or
agree to take any action  that would prevent CCo from accounting for the
business  combination to be effected by the Arrangement as a pooling of 
interests in accordance with the United States generally accepted  accounting
principles and applicable rules and regulations of the  SEC and each of ECo
and CCo agrees to consult with the other and  with their respective
independent accountants concerning any  potential transaction or other  
-25-    matter or action that might have such effect forthwith upon such 
potential transaction, matters or actions having been identified  (after
having made all its reasonable best efforts to make such  identification);
and   (f) CCo and ECo shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from 
Arthur Anderson LLP and Ernst and Young LLP, immediately before the 
commencement of the Measurement Period (as defined in the Plan of 
Arrangement) and a reconfirmation thereof on or before the  Effective Date,

reasonably, that the Arrangement will be  treated as a "pooling of interests"
for accounting purposes under  United States generally accepted accounting
principles.  4.2 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF ECO   ECo agrees that, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise agreed to in writing
by CCo or as set forth in the ECo Disclosure Letter, from the date hereof to
the Effective Date it will, and will cause each of the ECo Subsidiaries
to:   (a) Other than as contemplated by this Agreement, operate its 
business only in the usual, regular and ordinary manner and, to  the extent
consistent with such operation, use all commercially  reasonable efforts to

business dealings with  it;   (b) Maintain all of its property and assets
in customary repair,  order, and condition, reasonable wear and use and

respect to  the conduct of its business of such kinds and in such amounts

consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited  statements of income and
changes in financial position as of the  end of each fiscal quarter of ECo,
and as of the corresponding  fiscal quarter of the previous fiscal year. ECo
hereby represents  and warrants that such consolidated financial statements

defined herein) whether or not initiated by ECo and in connection  therewith,
ECo shall exercise all rights to require the return of  information regarding
ECo previously provided to such parties and  shall exercise all rights to
require the destruction of all  materials including or incorporating any
information regarding  ECo. From and after the date hereof, ECo and the ECo
Subsidiaries  will not, and will not authorize or permit any of their 
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or  encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) or  participate in or take any
other action to facilitate any  inquiries or the making of any proposal which

from  any person, or engage in any discussion, negotiations or  inquiries
relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal;  provided, however, that
notwithstanding any other provision  hereof, ECo may at any time prior to the
time ECo\'s shareholders  shall have voted to approve the Plan of Arrangement
and the other  transactions contemplated thereby (i) engage in discussions
or  negotiations with a third party who (without any solicitation, 
initiation or encouragement, directly or indirectly, by ECo, any  ECo
Subsidiary or the Representatives after the date hereof)  seeks to initiate
such discussions or negotiations and may  furnish such third party
information concerning ECo and its  business, properties and assets which has
previously been  provided to CCo if, and only to the extent that: (A) the
third  party has first made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal  that
is demonstrably financially superior to the shareholders of  ECo as compared
to the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (as determined in good
faith by ECo\'s board of  directors after receiving the advice of its outside
financial  advisors that is reflected in minutes of the board of directors) 
and has demonstrated that the funds or other consideration  necessary for the
Acquisition Proposal are available (as  determined by ECo\'s board of
directors in the same manner and  with the same advice) and is not subject to
any due diligence  conditions other than confirmatory due diligence (a
"Superior  Proposal") and ECo\'s board of directors has concluded in good 
faith (after considering applicable law and the advice of outside  counsel
and outside financial advisors that is reflected in  minutes of a meeting of
board of directors) that such action is  necessary for the ECo board of
directors to act in a manner  consistent with fiduciary duties under
applicable law; (B) upon  receipt of such written Acquisition Proposal, ECo
provides prompt  notice orally and in writing to CCo specifying the identity
of  such person or entity and prior to furnishing such information to  or
entering into discussions or negotiations with such person or  entity,
notifies CCo in writing that it is furnishing information  to or entering
into discussions or negotiations with such person  or entity in respect to a
Superior Proposal and receives from  such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement  having confidentiality and standstill terms
substantially   -28-    similar to those contained in the confidentiality
agreement  executed by CCo, providing full details forthwith, and in any 
event within one business day, of all material terms and  conditions of such
Superior Proposal and any amendments thereto  and confirming in writing the
determination of ECo\'s board of  directors that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior  Proposal; (C) ECo provides notice forthwith and in
any event  within one business day to CCo at such time as it is terminating 
any such discussions or negotiations with such person or entity;  and (D) ECo
promptly provides to CCo any information provided to  any such person or
entity whether or not previously made  available to CCo, (ii) comply with
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
tender or  exchange offer, if applicable, and similar rules under
applicable  Canadian securities laws relating to the provision of
directors\'  circulars, and make appropriate disclosure with respect
thereto  to ECo\'s shareholders and (iii) accept, recommend, approve or 
implement a Superior Proposal from a third party, but only (in  the case of
this clause (iii)) if prior to such acceptance,  recommendation, approval or
implementation, ECo\'s board of  directors shall have concluded in good
faith, after considering  provisions of applicable law and after giving
effect to all  proposals to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement  and the Arrangement which may be offered by CCo during the five 
day notice period set forth below and after receiving the advice  of outside
counsel and financial advisors that is reflected in  minutes of a meeting of
board of directors, that such action is  necessary for ECo\'s board of
directors to act in a manner  consistent with fiduciary duties under
applicable law and ECo  terminates this Agreement in accordance with Sections
6.1(j) and  6.4 and concurrently therewith has paid the fees payable 
thereunder. ECo shall give CCo orally and in writing at least  five days
advance notice of any proposed decision by the board of  directors of ECo to
accept, recommend, approve or implement a  Superior Proposal which notice
shall identify the party making  the Superior Proposal and shall provide full
details of all  material terms and conditions thereof and any amendments
thereto.  ECo shall inform CCo of the status (including all terms and 
conditions thereof) of any discussions and negotiations with such  party. In
addition ECo shall, and shall cause its respective  financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate in good faith with CCo  to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this  Agreement and of the Plan of Arrangement as
would enable ECo to  proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior
to  executing any agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, ECo  shall
provide CCo with copies of such agreement and related  documentation executed
by the party making the Superior Proposal.  In the event CCo proposes to
amend this Agreement and the  Arrangement to provide financially equivalent
or superior value  (taking into account the risks associated with the form
of  consideration and transaction) as is provided under the Superior 
Proposal, then ECo shall not enter into any agreement regarding  the Superior
Proposal. As used herein, "Acquisition Proposal"  shall mean a proposal or
offer (other than by CCo), whether or  not subject to a due diligence
condition, and whether or not in  writing, to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly,  beneficial ownership (as defined under Part XIII of the 
Securities Act (Alberta)) of all or a material portion of the  assets of ECo
or any material ECo Subsidiary or   -29-    to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, more than 9.9%  (and for the purposes of Section
6.4(c), 20%) of the outstanding  voting shares of ECo whether by an
arrangement, amalgamation,  merger, consolidation or other business
combination, by means of  a sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets,
tender offer  or exchange offer or similar transaction involving ECo or any 
material ECo Subsidiary including without limitation any single  or multi-
step transaction or series of related transactions which  is structured to
permit such third party to acquire beneficial  ownership of all or a material
portion of the assets of ECo or  any material ECo Subsidiary or to acquire in
any manner, directly  or indirectly, more than 9.9% (and for the purposes of
Section  6.4(c), 20%) of the outstanding voting shares of ECo (other than 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); and   (o) ECo will allow
CCo and its agents reasonable access, during  normal business hours for due
diligence purposes and for the  purposes of providing an orderly transition
of operations, to the  files, books, records, offices and officers of itself
and its  subsidiaries, including any and all information relating to its 
tax matters, contracts, leases, licenses and real, personal and  intangible
property and financial condition. ECo will cause its  accountants to
cooperate with the other in making available to  CCo all financial
information reasonably requested, including the  right to examine all working
papers pertaining to tax matters and  financial statements prepared or
audited by such accountants. CCo  will allow ECo reasonable access to the
officers of CCo and to  the books and records of CCO Sub during normal
business hours for  due diligence purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as  expressly provided for herein, neither party shall be obligated 
to make available to the other party any of its\' board of  directors\'
materials relating to the assessment or evaluation of  the transactions
contemplated hereby or any alternative  transactions nor any information
supplied by any of its officers,  directors, employees, financial advisors,
legal advisors,  representatives and agents in connection therewith. All 
information provided will be subject to the Confidentiality  Agreements dated
December 19, 2000 and January 24, 2001.  4.3 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF

or otherwise agreed to in writing by ECo, from the date hereof to the

legislation in Canada; and   (c) CCo will not, during the Measurement
Period, buy back any of its  outstanding Common Stock.  4.4 PUBLIC
ANNOUNCEMENTS   Neither CCo nor ECo, nor any of their respective affiliates,

obligations of CCo to consummate and effect the transactions contemplated
hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or before the
Effective Date of the following additional conditions:   (a) Representations

not taken any action after the date hereof  that has resulted in such letters
not being received; and   (g) Material Adverse Effect. There shall not have
been any Material  Adverse Effect since September 30, 2000 in respect of

Shareholders Meeting, CCo shall determine, and shall publicly disclose
(either by including the information in a CCo Securities Report filed with
the SEC or in a press release disseminated over a recognized newswire service
in the United States), that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Plan of Arrangement will not be accounted for on a pooling of
interests accounting basis under United States generally accepted accounting
principles, then:   (a) the agreement of CCo and ECo in Section 4.1(e) shall
terminate;  and   (b) so long as such public disclosure by CCo is made
prior to the  commencement of the Measurement Period (as defined in the Plan
of  Arrangement) after taking into account any postponement to the  date of
the ECo Shareholders Meeting, the conditions to  completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in  Sections 5.2(f) and 5.3(f)
shall be deemed to be waived as of the  date of such public
disclosure;  provided that, if the principal reason for such determination
by CCo is the breach by ECo of its obligations under Section 4.1(e), then the
obligations of ECo under such section shall not be terminated under Section
5.4(a) above and the condition to completion in favour of CCo under Section
5.3(f) shall not be deemed to be waived under Section 5.4(b) above (and, for
greater   -35-   certainty, the condition under Section 5.2(f) continues
to be deemed to be waived under Section 5.4(b)).   ARTICLE 6 
TERMINATION  6.1 TERMINATION   This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the securityholders entitled to vote of

warranty of CCo shall have become untrue,  in either case which has or is
reasonably expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect on CCo, and which CCo
fails to cure  within 15 business days after written notice thereof from
ECo  (except that no cure period shall be provided for a breach by CCo 
which by its nature cannot be cured and in no event shall such  cure period
extend beyond the Termination Date); provided that a  breach of such a
representation or warranty or any such  representation or warranty that shall
have become untrue shall be  deemed not to have and not to be reasonably
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect on CCo for purposes of this
Agreement if  CCo has publicly disclosed (either by including the
information  in a CCo Securities Report filed with the SEC or in a press 
release disseminated over a recognized newswire service in the  United
States) the matter or matters giving rise to such breach  or untruth, or such
matter or matters have been otherwise widely  reported to the general public
in the United States, before the  commencement of the Measurement Period (as
defined in the Plan of  Arrangement) after taking into account any
postponement of the  ECo Shareholder Meeting;   (c) by ECo, if there has
been a breach in any material respect by CCo  of any covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement on the  part of CCo which CCo fails to cure
within 15 business days after  written notice thereof from ECo (except that
no cure period shall  be provided for a breach by CCo which by its nature
cannot be  cured and in no event shall such cure period extend beyond the 
Termination Date);   (d) by CCo, if there has been a breach by ECo of any
representation  or warranty set forth in this Agreement on the part of ECo,
or if  any representation or warranty of ECo shall have become untrue,  in
either case which has or is reasonably expected to have a  Material Adverse
Effect on ECo, and which ECo fails to cure  within 15 business days after
written notice thereof from CCo  (except that no cure period shall be
provided for a breach by ECo  which by its nature cannot be cured and in no
event shall such  cure period extend beyond the Termination Date);  
-36-    (e) by CCo, if there has been a breach in any material respect by
ECo  of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the  part
of ECo which ECo fails to cure within 15 business days after  written notice
thereof from CCo (except that no cure period shall  be provided for a breach
by ECo which by its nature cannot be  cured and in no event shall such cure
period extend beyond the  Termination Date);   (f) by either party, if all
the conditions for Closing the  Arrangement for the benefit of such party
shall not have been  satisfied or waived on or before 5:00 p.m., Calgary,
Alberta time  on June 29, 2001 (the "Termination Date"), other than as a
result  of a breach of this Agreement by the terminating party;   (g) by
either party if the securityholders of ECo do not approve the  Arrangement
(and the other matters to be approved at such meeting  as provided in Section
7.1 hereof) at the ECo Shareholders  Meeting;   (h) by either party if a
final and non-appealable order shall have  been entered in any action or
proceeding before any Governmental  Entity that prevents or makes illegal the
consummation of the  Arrangement;   (i) by CCo if the ECo board of
directors or any committee of the ECo  board of directors shall (i) withdraw
or modify in any adverse  manner its approval or recommendation in respect of
this  Agreement, the Arrangement and the other transactions  contemplated
hereby or (ii) fails to reaffirm its approval or  recommendation upon
request, from time to time, by CCo to do so  or upon an Acquisition Proposal
in respect of ECo being publicly  announced or proposed, offered or made to
the ECo Shareholders or  to ECo (such reaffirmation to be made within 10 days
of such  request being made or such Acquisition Proposal being publicly 
announced, proposed, offered or made or immediately prior to the  meeting of
ECo Shareholders, whichever occurs first);   (j) by ECo, prior to the
approval of this Agreement, the Arrangement  and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by the  securityholders of ECo if, as a result of a
Superior Proposal by  a party other than CCo or any of its affiliates, ECo\'s
board of  directors determines in accordance with Section 4.2(n) to accept, 
recommend, approve or implement such Superior Proposal and ECo  has otherwise
complied with all of its representations,  warranties, covenants and
agreements herein contained including,  without limitation, Sections 4.2(n)
and 6.4; or   (k) by either party if the CCo Average Price (as defined in
the Plan  of Arrangement) is less than $28 (such dollar amount being 
subject to adjustment in the same manner as is set forth in  Section
1.2(b)).  6.2 NOTICE OF TERMINATION   Any termination of this Agreement
under Section 6.1 above will be effected by the delivery of written notice by
the terminating party to the other party hereto.   -37-   6.3 EFFECT OF

Agreement by either ECo or CCo pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of CCo or ECo or their respective officers or
directors, except that: (i) the provisions of Section 6.4(c) shall survive
such termination; (ii) the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements dated
December 19, 2000 and January 24, 2001 shall survive any such termination;
and (iii) no party shall be released or relieved from any liability arising
from the willful breach by such party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements as set forth in this Agreement (and, in
the case of wilful breach, the termination fees payable, if any, under
section 6.4 shall not be treated as liquidated damages).  6.4 TERMINATION
FEE   (a) If this Agreement is terminated by ECo pursuant to Section 
6.1(c), then CCo shall pay to ECo a cash termination fee of $30  million at
the time of such termination;   (b) If this Agreement is terminated by CCo
pursuant to Section 6.1(d)  or Section 6.1(e), then ECo shall pay to CCo a
cash termination  fee of $30 million at the time of such termination;   (c)
If: (x) an Acquisition Proposal in respect of ECo is publicly  announced or
is proposed, offered or made to the ECo Shareholders  or to ECo prior to the
ECo Shareholders Meeting; (y) this  Agreement is terminated by either party
pursuant to Section  6.1(g); and (z) either within 12 months following such 
termination ECo enters into, directly or indirectly, an  agreement,
commitment or understanding with respect to such  Acquisition Proposal or
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated  or within six months following such
termination ECo enters into  an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal is  consummated, then ECo shall pay to CCo a cash termination fee
of  $30 million, payable immediately upon satisfaction of the  requirements
contained in (x), (y) and (z).   (d) If this Agreement is terminated by CCo
pursuant to Section  6.1(i), then ECo shall pay to CCo upon such termination
a cash  termination fee of $30 million at the time of such termination.  
(e) If this Agreement is terminated by ECo pursuant to Section  6.1(j), then
ECo shall pay to CCo upon such termination a cash  termination fee of $30
million at the time of such termination.   (f) CCo and ECo each agree that
the agreements contained in Sections  6.4(a) through 6.4(e) are an integral
part of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. If either party
fails to promptly  pay the other party any fee due under such Sections
6.4(a)  through 6.4(e), it shall pay the other party\'s costs and expenses 
(including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any  action, including
the filing of any lawsuit or other legal  action, taken to collect payment,
together with interest on the  amount of any unpaid fee at the publicly
announced prime rate  from time to time of Chase Manhattan Bank from the date
such fee  was first due.   -38-    ARTICLE 7  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  
CCo and ECo each agree to take the following actions after the execution of
this Agreement.  7.1 MEETINGS   ECo shall duly call a meeting of its
securityholders entitled to vote to be held within 45 days after the Proxy
Circular is prepared for the purpose of voting upon the Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and
ECo shall, through its board of directors, recommend to its securityholders
in the Proxy Circular approval of such matters and shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings. ECo may only change
such recommendation in the event that the board of directors of ECo
concludes, in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel and
financial advisors that is reflected in the minutes of a meeting of the board
of directors, that such action is necessary for the board of directors to act
in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty or applicable law and, in
the event that Section 4.2(n) is applicable, if ECo and its board of
directors are in compliance with that Section; however, notwithstanding any
change in such recommendation, ECo will not, subject to compliance with
applicable law, postpone or cancel the holding of the meeting of its security
holders, provided that ECo may postpone the meeting if, after consultation
with CCo, there is a reasonable basis to expect that there are conditions in
Section 5.1 or 5.2 to completion of the transactions contemplated hereunder
(other than the conditions in Section 5.1(a), (b) and (c)) which are unlikely
to be satisfied in order for completion of the transactions to occur within 5
business days after the meeting of the securityholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, ECo will, in any event whatsoever, hold the meeting of its
securityholders no later than June 25, 2001.  7.2 THE CLOSING   Subject to
the termination of this Agreement as provided in Article 6, the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take
place at the offices of Macleod Dixon LLP, Suite 3700, 400 - 3rd Avenue S.W.,
Calgary, Alberta, T2P 4H2 on a date (the "Closing Date") and at a time to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties, which date shall be no later than the
first business day after all conditions to Closing set forth herein shall
have been satisfied or waived, unless another place, time and date
is mutually selected by ECo and CCo. Concurrently with the Closing, the Plan
of Arrangement will be filed with the Registrar under the ABCA.  7.3
ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS/RESERVATION OF SHARES   (a) Provided all other
conditions of this Agreement have been  satisfied or waived, ECo shall, on
the Closing Date, file  Articles of Arrangement pursuant to Section 186 of
the ABCA to  give effect to the Plan of Arrangement.   (b) On the Effective
Date:   (i) CCo and CCo Sub shall execute and deliver a Support  Agreement
containing the terms and conditions set forth in  Exhibit C, together
with   -39-    such other terms and conditions as may be agreed to by
the  parties hereto acting reasonably; and   (ii) CCo, CCo Sub and a
Canadian trust company to be mutually  agreeable to CCo and ECo, acting
reasonably, shall execute  and deliver a Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement  containing the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit  D,
together with such other terms and conditions as may be  agreed to by the
parties hereto acting reasonably.   (c) On or before the Effective Date, CCo
will reserve for issuance  such number of shares of CCo Common Stock as shall
be necessary  to give effect to the exchanges of options contemplated
hereby.  7.4 EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS   Promptly after the Effective Time, CCo
will notify in writing each holder of a ECo Option of the exchange of such
ECo Option for an option to purchase CCo Common Stock in accordance with the
Plan of Arrangement, and CCo will confirm its agreement to honour such
options in accordance with their terms.  7.5 INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED
MATTERS   (a) CCo agrees that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor  of the present or former directors and officers of ECo (as such)  or
any of the ECo Subsidiaries or present or former directors and  officers (as
such) of ECo or any of the ECo Subsidiaries serving  or who served at ECo\'s
or any of the ECo Subsidiaries\' request as  a director, officer, employee,
agent or representative of another  corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit  plan or other enterprise (each such present or
former director or  officer of ECo or any of the ECo Subsidiaries, an
"Indemnified  Party"), as provided by contract or in ECo\'s charter or bylaws
or  similar documents of any of the ECo Subsidiaries in effect as of  the
date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to the  Effective Time,
shall survive and shall continue in full force  and effect and without
modification for a period of not less than  the statutes of limitations
applicable to such matters.   (b) From and after the Effective Time, CCo and
ECo, jointly and  severally, shall and CCo shall cause ECo to indemnify and
hold  harmless to the fullest extent permitted under the ABCA, each 
Indemnified Party against any costs and expenses (including  reasonable
attorney\'s fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims and  damages and
liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement thereof  with the consent of the
indemnifying party, such consent not to  be unreasonably withheld, in
connection with any actual or  threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that  is based on, or arises out of, the fact that such person
is or  was a director or officer of ECo or any ECo Subsidiary (including 
without limitation with respect to any of the transactions  contemplated
hereby or the Arrangement) or who is serving or who  served at ECo\'s or any
of the ECo Subsidiaries\' request as a  director, officer, employee, agent or
representative of another  corporation,   -40-    partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other  enterprise. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation, CCo shall cause
ECo to pay the  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in advance of the
final  disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or 
investigation to the fullest extent permitted by law subject to  the
limitations imposed by the ABCA. Without limiting the  foregoing, in the
event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation is brought
against any Indemnified Parties, (i)  the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably  satisfactory to CCo and, subject to limitations imposed
by the  ABCA, ECo shall (or CCo shall cause ECo to) pay all reasonable  fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties  promptly as
statements therefor are received; and (ii) CCo will  use all reasonable
efforts to assist in the defense of such  matter; provided, however, that
neither ECo nor CCo shall be  liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written  consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any
Indemnified  Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
7.5(b),  upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or 
investigation, shall notify CCo (but the failure to so notify  shall not
relieve a party from any liability which it may have  under this Section
7.5(b) unless such failure results in actual  prejudice to such party and
then only to the extent of such  prejudice). The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain only  one law firm in any jurisdiction to represent them
with respect  to each such matter unless such counsel determines that there
is,  under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on  any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more  Indemnified
Parties, in which event additional counsel may be  required to be retained by
the Indemnified Parties.   (c) Subject to limitations imposed by the ABCA,
provided the  Arrangement becomes effective, ECo shall (or CCo shall cause
ECo  to) pay all expenses, including reasonable attorney\'s fees, as  the
same may be incurred by any Indemnified Parties in any action  by any
Indemnified Party or parties seeking to enforce the  indemnity or other
obligations provided for in this Section 7.5;  provided, however, that ECo
will be entitled to reimbursement for  any advances made under this Section
7.5 to any Indemnified Party  who ultimately proves unsuccessful in enforcing
the indemnity as  finally determined by a non-appealable judgment in a court
of  competent jurisdiction, and payment of such expenses in advance  of the
final disposition of the action shall be made only upon  receipt of any
undertaking by the Indemnified Party to reimburse  all amounts advanced if
such action ultimately proves  unsuccessful.   (d) Provided the Arrangement
becomes effective, for a period of six  years after the Effective Date, CCo
shall continue in effect  director and officer liability insurance for the
benefit of the  Indemnified Parties in such amounts, and with such
deductibles,  retained amounts, coverages and exclusions as ECo provides
for  its own directors and officers at the date hereof.   (e) This Section
7.5, which shall survive the consummation of this  Agreement and the
Arrangement, is intended to benefit each person  or entity indemnified
hereunder.   -41-   7.6 AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS   (a) ECo will use its
reasonable best efforts to have its Affiliates  sign and deliver to CCo the
ECo Affiliate Agreements in the form  of Exhibit E concurrently with the
execution hereof. For purposes  of this Agreement, an "Affiliate" shall have
the meaning referred  to in SEC Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135 and in
Rule 145  under the Securities Act. In the event that ECo does not succeed 
in getting its respective Affiliates to sign and deliver the  Affiliate
Agreements, such party shall continue to use its  reasonable best efforts to
have its Affiliates sign and deliver  the Affiliate Agreements.   (b) CCo
agrees that it shall publicly release the combined financial  results
(including combined sales and net income) of CCo and ECo  for the period
ending at the end of the first full calendar month  of post-combination
combined operations of CCo and ECo as soon as  reasonably practicable
following Closing, notwithstanding that  such release may not coincide with a
financial quarterly report  or be in the form of a report filed with the SEC
on Form 10-Q.  7.7 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS   (a) CCo covenants and agrees
that, after the Effective Time, it will  and will cause ECo, as the case may
be, (and any successor) to  honour and comply with the terms of the existing
executive  employee agreements of ECo which ECo has disclosed in writing to 
CCo and covenants and agrees that it will not terminate the  employment of
any executive officer of ECo, other than for Just  Cause (as that term is
defined in the executive employment  agreements) for a period of not less
than 45 days.   (b) this Section 7.7 is:   (i) intended for the benefit of
employees of ECo and shall be  enforceable by each such person and his or her
heirs,  executors, administrators and other legal representatives 
(collectively, the "Third Party Beneficiaries") and ECo  and any successors
shall hold the rights and benefits of  this Section 7.7 in trust for and on
behalf of the Third  Party Beneficiaries and ECo and any successor hereby 
accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of and  enforce performance
of such covenants on behalf of Third  Party Beneficiaries; and   (ii) are
in addition to and not in substitution for, any other  rights that the Third
Party Beneficiaries may have by  contract or otherwise.   -42-   
ARTICLE 8  MISCELLANEOUS  8.1 NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES   All representations and warranties of the parties contained in
this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of the parties to this Agreement,
until the earlier of the valid termination of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, whereupon such representations and warranties will expire and be of no
further force or effect. All agreements and covenants of the parties shall
survive the Closing Date, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement.  8.2 NOTICES   All notices and other communications hereunder

ARRANGEMENT  2.1 ARRANGEMENT   At the Effective Time, the following
transactions shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the following order
without any further act or formality:   (a) each of the outstanding ECo
Common Shares (other than ECo Common  Shares held by Shareholders who have
exercised their right of  dissent in accordance with Article 3 hereof and are
ultimately  entitled to be paid the fair value of their ECo Common Shares) 
will, without any further action on behalf of the Shareholders,  be
transferred to CCo Sub in consideration for a number of  Exchangeable Shares
determined in accordance with the Exchange  Ratio;   (b) each Shareholder
will receive only a whole number of Exchangeable  Shares resulting from the
transfer of such Shareholder\'s ECo  Common Shares to CCo Sub. In lieu of
fractional Exchangeable  Shares, each Shareholder who otherwise would be
entitled to  receive such fractional share shall be paid by CCo Sub an
amount  determined in accordance herewith in full satisfaction of such 
fractional entitlement;   (c) upon the transfer of shares referred to in
Section 2.1(a) above:  (i) each Shareholder shall cease to be such a holder
of ECo  Common Shares, shall have his name removed from the register of 
holders of ECo Common Shares and shall become a holder of the  number of
fully paid Exchangeable Shares to which he is entitled  as a result of the
transfer of shares referred to in Section  2.1(a) and such Shareholder\'s
name shall be added to the register  of holders of such securities
accordingly; and (ii) CCo Sub shall  become the legal and beneficial owner of
all of the ECo Common  Shares so transferred;   (d) each of the outstanding
Options (other than Options held by  holders who have exercised their rights
of dissent in accordance  with Section 3.1 hereof and who are ultimately
entitled to be  paid the fair value for such Options) will, without any
further  action on the part of any Optionholder: (i) vest in accordance 
with the rights of the holder thereof; and (ii) be converted into  or
exchanged for an option to purchase the number of shares of  CCo Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of ECo  Common Shares subject to such
Option at the Effective Time by the  Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share of CCo Common  Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such
Option  immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange 
Ratio, and expressed in U.S. dollars. For the purposes of  determining the
exercise price per share of CCo Common Stock, the  exercise price per share
of ECo Common Shares subject to such  Option shall be adjusted using the
average of the Canadian Dollar  Exchange Rate (expressed to the fourth
decimal point) for each of  the trading days in the Measurement Period. If
the foregoing  calculation results in a converted Option being exercisable
for a  fraction of a share of CCo Common Stock, then the number of  shares
of CCo Common Stock subject to such Option will be rounded  down to the
nearest whole number of shares, and the exercise  price per whole share of
CCo Common Stock will be as determined  above. The obligations of ECo under
the Options as so converted  shall be assumed by CCo and CCo shall be
substituted for ECo  under, and as sponsor of, ECo\'s stock option plan.
Except as  provided in this paragraph (d), the term and all other terms and 
conditions of the Options in effect immediately prior to giving  effect to
the Arrangement shall govern the Options; and    A-4    (e) holders of
ECo Common Shares who are residents of Canada for the  purposes of the ITA
and who receive Exchangeable Shares under  Section 2.1(a) shall be entitled
to make an income tax election  pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the ITA with
respect to the  transfer of their ECo Common Shares to CCo Sub by providing
two  signed copies of the necessary election forms to CCo Sub within  90
days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the  details of the
number of shares transferred and the applicable  agreed amounts for the
purposes of such elections. Thereafter,  subject to the election forms
complying with the provisions of  the ITA, the forms will be signed by CCo
Sub and returned to such  holders of ECo Common Shares for filing with
Revenue Canada,  Customs, Excise and Taxation.  2.2 ALLOCATION OF
CONSIDERATION   A Shareholder who has transferred his ECo Common Shares to
CCo Sub as contemplated under Section 2.1(a) shall be considered to have
disposed of a portion (the "share portion") of such Shareholder\'s ECo Common
Shares solely in consideration for Exchangeable Shares and to have disposed
of the remaining portion of such ECo Common Shares for all other ancillary
rights and benefits (the "Ancillary Rights") associated with the Exchangeable
Shares and the Voting Share under the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the
Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement and the Support Agreement. The share
portion (expressed as a number) shall be equal to the number of ECo Common
Shares obtained when the total number of ECo Common Shares held by the
Shareholder is multiplied by the aggregate fair market value of the
Exchangeable Shares received by the Shareholder divided by the sum of such
aggregate fair market value and the aggregate fair market value of the
Ancillary Rights received by the Shareholder.    ARTICLE 3  RIGHTS OF
DISSENT  3.1 RIGHTS OF DISSENT   Registered Shareholders and Optionholders
may exercise rights of dissent with respect to their ECo Common Shares or
Options pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Section 184 of the ABCA
(as modified by the Interim Order) and this Section 3.1 (the "Dissent
Procedures") in connection with the Arrangement, and holders who duly
exercise such rights of dissent and who:   (a) are ultimately entitled to be
paid fair value for the ECo Common  Shares or Options shall be deemed to have
transferred such ECo  Common Shares or Options to ECo for cancellation on the
Effective  Date; or   (b) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to
be paid the fair  value for their ECo Common Shares or Options shall be
deemed to  have participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as any 
nondissenting Shareholder or Optionholder, as the case may be,  but in no
case shall ECo be required to recognize such holders as Shareholders or
Optionholders on and after the Effective Time, and the names of such
persons shall be deleted from the registers of Shareholders or Optionholders
on the Effective Time.     A-5     ARTICLE 4  CERTIFICATES AND
FRACTIONAL SHARES  4.1 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING EXCHANGEABLE
SHARES   At or promptly after the Effective Time, CCo Sub shall deposit with
the Depositary, for the benefit of the Shareholders who exchanged their ECo
Common Shares pursuant to the Arrangement, certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares issued pursuant to the Arrangement upon the exchange.
Upon surrender to the Depositary of a certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding ECo Common Shares, and such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall forthwith deliver to
such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of Exchangeable Shares which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the Arrangement (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in
lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 4.3), and any
certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of ECo Common Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of ECo, a certificate representing the proper number of
Exchangeable Shares (together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in lieu of fractional
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 4.3) shall be delivered to a
transferee if the certificate representing such ECo Common Shares is
presented to the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding ECo Common Shares shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time, but subject to Section 4.5, to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender (a) the certificate representing Exchangeable
Shares as contemplated by this Section 4.1, (b) a cash payment in lieu of any
fractional Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by Section 4.3 and (c) any
dividends or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid or payable with respect to Exchangeable Shares as
contemplated by Section 4.2.  4.2 DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS   No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Exchangeable Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any formerly outstanding
ECo Common Shares which were not exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 4.3 (and no interest will be earned and payable thereon),
unless and until the certificate representing such ECo Common Shares shall be
surrendered in accordance with Section 4.1. Subject to applicable law and to
Section 4.5, at the time of such surrender of any such certificate (or, in
the case of clause (c) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall
be paid to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares resulting from such
exchange, in all cases without interest, (a) the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional Exchangeable Share to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 4.3, (b) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Exchangeable Shares, and (c) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender or a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to
such Exchangeable Shares.  4.3 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES   No certificates or
scrip representing fractional Exchangeable Shares shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to Section 4.1, and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
possess or exercise any rights as a security holder of CCo Sub. In lieu
of   A-6   any such fractional interests, each person entitled thereto
will receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (a) such fractional interest, multiplied by
(b) the CCo Average Price, such amount to be provided to the Depositary by
CCo Sub upon request.  4.4 LOST CERTIFICATES   If any certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding ECo Common
Shares which were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in
lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 4.3) deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance with Section 2.1. When seeking
such certificate and payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the person to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares
are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to CCo Sub, CCo and the Transfer Agent, as
the case may be, in such sum as CCo Sub may direct or otherwise indemnify CCo
Sub, CCo and the Transfer Agent in a manner satisfactory to CCo Sub, CCo and
the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made against CCo Sub, CCo or
the Transfer Agent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.  4.5 EXTINGUISHMENT OF RIGHTS   Any certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding ECo
Common Shares which were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 and has not been
deposited, with all other instruments required by Section 4.1, on or prior to
the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim
or interest of any kind or nature as a Shareholder or a holder of
Exchangeable Shares or shares of CCo Common Stock. On such date,
the Exchangeable Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and any cash pursuant to Section 4.3) to which the former registered
holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was
ultimately entitled (or, if the Automatic Redemption Date has occurred, the
resulting shares of CCo Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been
surrendered to CCo Sub (or, in the event that the Automatic Redemption Date
has occurred, CCo), together with all entitlements to dividends,
distributions, cash and interest thereon held for such former registered
holder, for no consideration and such shares shall thereupon be canceled and
the name of the former registered holder shall be removed from the register
of holders of such shares.    ARTICLE 5  AMENDMENT  5.1 PLAN OF
ARRANGEMENT AMENDMENT   ECo reserves the right to amend, modify and/or
supplement this Plan of Arrangement from time to time at any time prior to

same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for the
corresponding dividend declared on the CCo Common Stock.  3.4 If on any
payment date for any dividends declared on the Exchangeable Shares under
Section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in full on all of
the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends which remain
unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of
Directors on which the Corporation shall have sufficient moneys, assets or
property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.  3.5 Except
as provided in this Article 3, the holders of Exchangeable Shares shall not
be entitled to receive dividends in respect thereof.  3.6 Payment of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration shall satisfy in full all Unpaid Dividends
relating to the Exchangeable Shares in respect of which the Exchangeable

long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall
not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in Article 10 of
these share provisions:   (a) pay any dividends on the Common Shares, or
any other shares  ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, other than
stock  dividends payable in any such other shares ranking junior to the 
Exchangeable Shares;   (b) redeem or purchase or make any capital
distribution in respect of  Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior
to the  Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or  on
any liquidation distribution;   (c) redeem or purchase any other shares of
the Corporation ranking  equally with the Exchangeable Shares with respect to
the payment  of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or   (d)
amend the articles or by-laws of the Corporation, in either case  in any
manner that would affect the rights or privileges of the  holders of the
Exchangeable Shares.   The restrictions in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b) and
4.1(c) above shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable
Shares corresponding to dividends declared with a record date on or following
the effective date of the Plan of Arrangement on the CCo Common Stock shall
have been declared on the Exchangeable Shares and paid in full. Nothing
herein shall be interpreted to restrict the Corporation from issuing
additional Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares.    ARTICLE 5 
DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION  5.1 In the event of the liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any other distribution of the
assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-
up its affairs, provided that neither CCo nor CCo Holdco shall have exercised
the Liquidation Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of   
B-6   the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such
holder on the effective date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
(the "Liquidation Date"), before any distribution of any part of the assets
of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares
ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount equal to the
Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the
Liquidation Date (the "Liquidation Amount") in accordance with Section 5.2.
In connection with payment of the Liquidation Amount, the Corporation shall
be entitled to liquidate some of the CCo Common Stock which would otherwise
be deliverable as Exchangeable Share Consideration to any particular holder
of Exchangeable Shares in order to fund any statutory withholding tax
obligation.  5.2 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to
the exercise by CCo or CCo Holdco of the Liquidation Call Right, the
Corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon
presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under applicable law and the
articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, at the registered
office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation in Schedule A hereto or by notice to the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the
Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick up by the holder at the registered
office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation in Schedule A hereto or by notice to the holders
of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation of the Exchangeable
Share Consideration representing such holder\'s pro rata portion of the total
Liquidation Amount. On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of
the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount
for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and
surrender of share certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions,
in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the
total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
The Corporation shall have the right at any time on or after the Liquidation
Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the Exchangeable Share Consideration
in respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have
not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in a
custodial account or for safe keeping, in the case of non-cash items, with
any chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made,
the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount
for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender
of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of such Exchangeable Share
Consideration, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holders of the CCo Common
Stock delivered to them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such payment or
deposit of such Exchangeable Share Consideration, the holder shall be deemed
to still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes of all voting rights
with respect thereto under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  5.3
After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share,
such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of
the assets of the Corporation.  5.4 If CCo or CCo Holdco exercises the
Liquidation Call Right, each holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated
to sell the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder to CCo or CCo Holdco, as
the case may be, on the Liquidation Date on payment to such holder by CCo or
CCo Holdco, as the case may be,    B-7    of the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each
Exchangeable Share.  5.5 (a) Each of CCo and CCo Holdco shall have the
overriding right (the  "Liquidation Call Right"), in the event of and
notwithstanding  any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the 
Corporation as referred to in this Article 5, to purchase from  all but not
less than all of the holders (other than CCo or any  Subsidiary thereof) of
Exchangeable Shares on the Liquidation  Date all but not less than all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by  such holders on payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as
the case may be,  to each holder such holder\'s proportionate share of the 
Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day  prior to the
Liquidation Date (the "Liquidation Call Purchase  Price") in accordance with
Section 5.5(c). In the event of the  exercise of the Liquidation Call Right
by CCo or CCo Holdco, each  holder shall be obligated to sell all the
Exchangeable Shares  held by such holder to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case
may be, on  the Liquidation Date on payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the
case  may be, to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for  each
such share.   (b) To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, CCo or CCo Holdco,
as the  case may be, must notify the Transfer Agent in writing, as agent 
for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation of  its intention
to exercise such right at least 55 days before the  Liquidation Date in the
case of a voluntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation and at least five  Business Days before the Liquidation Date in
the case of an  involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the 
Corporation. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of  Exchangeable
Shares as to whether or not CCo or CCo Holdco has  exercised the Liquidation
Call Right forthwith after the expiry  of the date by which the same may be
exercised by CCo or CCo  Holdco. If CCo or CCo Holdco exercises the
Liquidation Call  Right, on the Liquidation Date, CCo or CCo Holdco, as the
case  may be, will purchase and the holders will sell all of the 
Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal  to the
Liquidation Call Purchase Price.   (c) For the purposes of completing the
purchase of the Exchangeable  Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right,
CCo or CCo Holdco,  as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, on or  before the Liquidation Date, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration  representing the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price.
Provided  that such Exchangeable Share Consideration has been so deposited 
with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Liquidation Date, the  right of
each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to  receiving such
holder\'s proportionate part of the total  Liquidation Call Purchase Price
payable by CCo or CCo Holdco, as  the case may be, without interest, upon
presentation and  surrender by the holder of certificates representing the 
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall, on  and after
the Liquidation Date, be considered and deemed for all  purposes to be the
holder of the CCo Common Stock delivered to  such holder. Upon surrender to
the Transfer Agent of a  certificate or certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares,  together with such other documents and instruments as
may be  required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the  Act
and the articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such  additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may  reasonably require, the
holder of such surrendered certificate or  certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor,  and the Transfer Agent on behalf of CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the  case may be, shall deliver to such holder, the Exchangeable
Share  Consideration to which such holder is entitled. If neither CCo  nor
CCo Holdco exercises the Liquidation Call Right in the manner  described
above, on the Liquidation Date, the holders of the  Exchangeable Shares will
be entitled to receive in    B-8    exchange therefor the liquidation
price otherwise payable by the  Corporation in connection with the
liquidation, dissolution or  winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to this
Article 5.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such Exchangeable Share 
Consideration is delivered to the holder, the holder shall be  deemed to
still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes  of all voting rights
with respect thereto under the Voting and  Exchange Trust Agreement.   
ARTICLE 6  RETRACTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER  6.1 A holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject to applicable law
and the exercise by CCo or CCo Holdco of the Retraction Call Right (which, if
exercised by CCo or CCo Holdco, shall be binding on the holder of
Exchangeable Shares) and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions
of this Article 6, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of
the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount
equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day
prior to the Retraction Date (the "Retraction Price") which, as set forth in
Section 6.4, shall be fully paid and satisfied by the delivery by or on
behalf of the Corporation of the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing such holder\'s Retraction Price. In connection with payment of
the Retraction Price, the Corporation shall be entitled to liquidate some of
the CCo Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable as Exchangeable
Share Consideration to the particular holder of Exchangeable Shares in order
to fund any statutory withholding tax obligation. To effect such redemption,
the holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the
Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the
Corporation in Schedule A hereto or by notice to the holders of Exchangeable
Shares the certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares
which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem, together with such
other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under applicable law and the by-laws of the Corporation
and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may
reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement (the
"Retraction Request") in the form of Schedule "A" hereto or in such other
form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:   (a) specifying that the
holder desires to have all or any number  specified therein of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by such  certificate or certificates (the
"Retracted Shares") redeemed by  the Corporation;   (b) stating the
Business Day on which the holder desires to have the  Corporation redeem the
Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"),  provided that the Retraction Date
shall be not less than five  Business Days nor more than 10 Business Days
after the date on  which the Retraction Request is received by the
Corporation and  further provided that, in the event that no such Business
Day is  specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction 
Date shall be deemed to be the tenth Business Day after the date  on which
the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation;  and   (c)
acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right")  of CCo or
CCo Holdco to purchase all but not less than all the  Retracted Shares
directly from the holder and that the Retraction  Request shall be deemed to
be a revocable offer by the holder to  sell the Retracted Shares in
accordance with the Retraction Call  Right on the terms and conditions set
out in Section 6.3 below.  6.2 Subject to the exercise by CCo or CCo Holdco
of the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer
Agent in the manner specified in Section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or
certificates representing the number of Exchangeable Shares which the holder
desires to have the    B-9   Corporation redeem, together with a
Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked
by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7, the Corporation shall
redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the
Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the total
Retraction Price with respect to such shares in accordance with Section 6.4
hereof. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by
any certificate are redeemed or purchased by CCo or CCo Holdco pursuant to
the Retraction Call Right, a new certificate for the balance of such
Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the
Corporation.  6.3 Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request,
the Corporation shall immediately notify CCo and CCo Holdco thereof. In order
to exercise the Retraction Call Right, CCo or CCo Holdco must notify the
Corporation in writing of its determination to do so (the "CCo Call Notice")
within two Business Days of such notification. If CCo or CCo Holdco does not
so notify the Corporation within such two Business Days, the Corporation will
notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that neither CCo nor CCo
Holdco will exercise the Retraction Call Right. If CCo or CCo Holdco delivers
the CCo Call Notice within such two Business Days, and provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7 hereof, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only
to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the case may be, in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In
such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and CCo or
CCo Holdco, as the case may be, shall purchase from such holder and such
holder shall sell to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, on the Retraction
Date the Retracted Shares for a purchase price per share (the "Purchase
Price") equal to the Retraction Price, which, as set forth in Section 6.4
hereof, shall be fully paid and satisfied by the delivery by or on behalf
of CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing such holder\'s Purchase Price. For the purposes of
completing a purchase pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or
before the Retraction Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing
the total Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration
has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, the closing of the purchase
and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall
be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date
and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the Corporation of such
Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event that
CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, does not deliver a CCo Call Notice
within two Business Days or otherwise comply with these Exchangeable Share
provisions in respect thereto, and provided that the Retraction Request is
not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7 hereof, the
Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in
the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 6.  6.4 Subject to receipt
by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation, CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to
deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the
address specified in the holder\'s Retraction Request or by holding for pick
up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in Schedule A
hereto or by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable
Share Consideration representing the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, and such delivery of such
Exchangeable Share Consideration to the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be
payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total
Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, except as to
any cheque included therein which is not paid on due presentation.  6.5 On
and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of
the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than the right to receive such holder\'s proportionate part of
the total    B-10   Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the
case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total applicable
Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not
be made, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected
until the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total applicable
Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been
paid. On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided
that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Retraction Price or
the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance
with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed
by the Corporation or purchased by CCo or CCo Holdco shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the CCo Common Stock
delivered to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such payment of such
Exchangeable Share Consideration to the holder, the holder shall be deemed to
still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes of all voting rights
with respect thereto under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  6.6
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Corporation
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in
a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares
would be contrary to liquidity or solvency requirements or other provisions
of applicable law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it
would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted
Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that neither CCo
nor CCo Holdco shall have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to
the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem
Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent
of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number
of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the
holder at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the
number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In
any case in which the redemption by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would
be contrary to liquidity or solvency requirements or other provisions of
applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance
with Section 6.2 of these share provisions on a pro rata basis and shall
issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of
the Corporation, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the
Corporation pursuant to Sections 6.2 or 6.6 hereof. Provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7 hereof, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by
the Corporation pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof as a result of liquidity or
solvency requirements or applicable law shall be deemed by giving the
Retraction Request to require CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, to
purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as
soon as practicable thereafter on payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case
may be, to such holder of the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share,
all as more specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement,
and CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, shall make such purchase.  6.7 A
holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to
the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request in
which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater
certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell
the Retracted Shares to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to have been revoked.    ARTICLE 7  REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE
SHARES BY THE CORPORATION  7.1 Subject to applicable law, and if neither CCo
or CCo Holdco exercises the Redemption Call Right (which, if exercised, shall
be binding on the holders of Exchangeable Shares), the Corporation shall on
the Automatic Redemption Date redeem all of the then outstanding Exchangeable
Shares for an amount    B-11    equal to the Exchangeable Share Price
applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Automatic Redemption Date
(the "Redemption Price") which, as set forth in Section 7.3 hereof, shall be
fully paid and satisfied by the delivery by or on behalf of the Corporation
of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Redemption
Price. In connection with payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing the Redemption Price, the Corporation shall be entitled to
liquidate some of the CCo Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable
as Exchangeable Share Consideration to the particular holder of Exchangeable
Shares in order to fund any statutory withholding tax obligation.  7.2 In
any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7,
the Corporation, or the Transfer Agent on behalf of the Corporation, shall,
at least 45 days before an Automatic Redemption Date (or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Corporation has knowledge of the occurrence
of an Automatic Redemption Date, if not known 45 days before the Automatic
Redemption Date) or before a possible Automatic Redemption Date which may
result from a failure of the holders of Exchangeable Shares to take necessary
action as described in clause (d) of the definition of Automatic Redemption
Date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice
in writing of the redemption or possible redemption by the Corporation or the
purchase by CCo or CCo Holdco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case
may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. Such notice shall set
out the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case
may be, the Automatic Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the
Redemption Call Right. In the case of any notice given in connection with a
possible Automatic Redemption Date, such notice will be given contingently
and will be withdrawn if the contingency does not occur.  7.3 On or after
the Automatic Redemption Date, and subject to the exercise by CCo or CCo
Holdco of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed
the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the Redemption Price for
each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender at the
registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under applicable law and the articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such
additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares
shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder
recorded in the securities register or at any office of the Transfer Agent as
may be specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the
Corporation, of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total
Redemption Price. On and after the Automatic Redemption Date, the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of
such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the
rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their
proportionate part of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing such
holder\'s proportionate share of the total Redemption Price, unless
payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing such holder\'s
proportionate share of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares shall not be made upon such holder\'s presentation and surrender of
certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing such holder\'s proportionate share of the total
Redemption Price has been paid to such holder. The Corporation shall have the
right, at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the
Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid, to deposit or cause to be deposited the
Exchangeable Share Consideration with respect to the Exchangeable Shares so
called for redemption, or of such of the said Exchangeable Shares represented
by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by
the holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in a custodial
account or for safe keeping, in the case of non-cash items, with any
chartered bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice. Upon the
later of such deposit being made and the Automatic Redemption Date,
the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made
shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit
or    B-12    Automatic Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said
certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of such Exchangeable Share
Consideration, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the CCo Common Stock
delivered to them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such payment or
deposit of such Exchangeable Share Consideration is made, the holder shall be
deemed to still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes of all voting
rights with respect thereto under the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement.  7.4 If CCo or CCo Holdco exercises the Redemption Call
Right, each holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may
be, on the Automatic Redemption Date against payment to such holder by CCo or
CCo Holdco, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Share Consideration
representing the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.  7.5
(a) Each of CCo and CCo Holdco shall have the overriding right (the 
"Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding any proposed redemption  of the
Exchangeable Shares by the Corporation pursuant to this  Article 7, to
purchase from all but not less than all of the  holders (other than CCo or
any Subsidiary thereof) of  Exchangeable Shares on the Automatic Redemption
Date all but not  less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such
holder  on payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, to the  holder
such holder\'s proportionate share of the Exchangeable  Share Price
applicable on the last Business Day prior to the  Automatic Redemption Date
(the "Redemption Call Purchase Price")  in accordance with Section 7.5(c). In
the event of the exercise  of the Redemption Call Right by CCo or CCo Holdco,
each holder  shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by 
the holder to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, on the  Automatic
Redemption Date on payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the  case may be, to the
holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price  for each such share.   (b) To
exercise the Redemption Call Right, CCo or CCo Holdco, as the  case may be,
must notify the Transfer Agent in writing, as agent  for the holders of
Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation of  its intention to exercise such
right not later than the date by  which the Corporation is required to give
notice of the Automatic  Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the
holders of  the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not CCo or CCo Holdco 
has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the date  by which
the same may be exercised by CCo or CCo Holdco. If CCo  or CCo Holdco
exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the  Automatic Redemption Date, CCo
or CCo Holdco, as the case may be,  will purchase and the holders will sell
all of the Exchangeable  Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal
to the  Redemption Call Purchase Price.   (c) For the purposes of
completing the purchase of the Exchangeable  Shares pursuant to the
Redemption Call Right, CCo or CCo Holdco,  as the case may be, shall deposit
with the Transfer Agent, on or  before the Automatic Redemption Date, the
Exchangeable Share  Consideration representing the total Redemption Call
Purchase  Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration has 
been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after the  Automatic
Redemption Date, the rights of each holder of  Exchangeable Shares will be
limited to receiving such holder\'s  proportionate part of the total
Redemption Call Purchase Price  payable by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may
be, upon  presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates 
representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the  holder
shall on and after the Automatic Redemption Date be    B-13   
considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the  CCo Common
Stock delivered to such holder. Upon surrender to the  Transfer Agent of a
certificate or certificates representing  Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and  instruments as may be required to effect a transfer
of  Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles and by-laws of  the
Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as  the Transfer
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such  surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf of  CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, shall
deliver to such  holder, the Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such
holder  is entitled. If neither CCo nor CCo Holdco exercises the  Redemption
Call Right in the manner described above, on the  Automatic Redemption Date,
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares  will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the redemption  price otherwise payable by the Corporation
in connection with the  redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to
this Article 7.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such Exchangeable
Share  Consideration is delivered to the holder, the holder shall be  deemed
to still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes  of all voting
rights with respect thereto under the Voting and  Exchange Trust
Agreement.    ARTICLE 8  EXCHANGE PUT RIGHT  8.1 Upon and subject to the
terms and conditions contained in these share provisions and the Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement:   (a) a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall have
the right (the  "Exchange Put Right") at any time to require CCo to purchase
all  or any part of the Exchangeable Shares of the holder, provided  that,
upon the exercise of such right, CCo may, at its option,  cause CCo Holdco to
purchase such shares; and   (b) upon the exercise by the holder of the
Exchange Put Right, the  holder shall be required to sell to CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the  case may be, and CCo shall be required to purchase, or cause
CCo  Holdco to purchase, from the holder, that number of Exchangeable 
Shares in respect of which the Exchange Put Right is exercised,  in
consideration of the payment by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case  may be, of
the Exchangeable Share Price applicable thereto (which  shall be the
Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last  Business Day prior to
receipt of notice required under Section  8.2 hereof) and delivery by or on
behalf of CCo or CCo Holdco, as  the case may be, of the Exchangeable Share
Consideration  representing the total applicable Exchangeable Share Price.
In  connection with payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration,  the
Corporation shall be entitled to liquidate some of the CCo  Common Stock
which would otherwise be deliverable to the  particular holder of
Exchangeable Shares in order to fund any  statutory withholding tax
obligation.  8.2 The Exchange Put Right provided in Section 8.1 hereof and
in Article 5 of the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement may be exercised at
any time by notice in writing given by the holder to and received by the
Trustee (the date of such receipt, the "Exchange Put Date") and accompanied
by presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such
Exchangeable Shares, together with such documents and instruments as may be
required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the
articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and
instruments as the Trustee may reasonably require, at the principal transfer
offices in Calgary, Alberta or Toronto, Ontario of the Trustee, or at such
other office or offices of the Trustee or of other persons designated by the
Trustee for that purpose as may from time to time be maintained by the
Trustee for that purpose. Such notice    B-14   shall be in the form of
Schedule B or such other form as may be acceptable to the Trustee, shall
stipulate the number of Exchangeable Shares in respect of which the right is
exercised (which may not exceed the number of shares represented by
certificates surrendered to the Trustee), shall be irrevocable unless the
exchange is not completed in accordance herewith and with the Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement and shall constitute the holder\'s authorization
to the Trustee (and such other persons aforesaid) to effect the exchange on
behalf of the holder.  8.3 The completion of the sale and purchase referred
to in section 8.1 hereof shall occur on the terms and conditions described in
Section 5.6 of the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  8.4 If only a part
of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate are to be sold and
purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Exchange Put Right, a new
certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued
to the holder at the expense of the Corporation.  8.5 On and after the
close of business on the Exchange Put Date, the holder of the Exchangeable
Shares in respect of which the Exchange Put Right is exercised shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other
than the right to receive the total applicable Exchangeable Share Price,
unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration
shall not be made, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain
unaffected until such payment has been made. On and after the close of
business on the Exchange Put Date provided that presentation and surrender of
certificates and payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration has been
made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the
Exchangeable Shares so purchased by CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be,
shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of
the CCo Common Stock delivered to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until
payment of the Exchangeable Share Consideration to the holder, the holder
shall be deemed to still be a holder of Exchangeable Shares for purposes of
all voting rights with respect thereto under the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement.    ARTICLE 9  VOTING RIGHTS  9.1 Except as required by
applicable law and the provisions hereof, the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any
meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation or to vote at any such
meeting.    ARTICLE 10  AMENDMENT AND APPROVAL  10.1 The rights,
privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares
may be added to, changed or removed but, except as hereinafter provided, only
with the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as
hereinafter specified.  10.2 Any approval given by the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares to add to, change or remove any right, privilege,
restriction or condition attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other
matter requiring the approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it shall have been
given in accordance with applicable law subject to a minimum requirement that
such approval be evidenced by resolution passed by not less than 66 2/3% of
the votes cast on such resolution by persons represented in person or by
proxy at a meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares (excluding Exchangeable
Shares beneficially owned by CCo or its Subsidiaries) duly called and held at
which the holders of at least 20% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at
that    B-15  time are present or represented by proxy. If at any such
meeting the holders of at least 20% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at
that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after
the time appointed for such meeting, then the meeting shall be adjourned to
such date not less than 10 days thereafter and to such time and place as may
be designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting, the
holders of Exchangeable Shares present or represented by proxy thereat may
transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a
resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than 66 2/3% of
the votes cast on such resolution by persons represented in person or by
proxy at such meeting (excluding Exchangeable Shares beneficially owned by
CCo or its Subsidiaries) shall constitute the approval or consent of the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares. For the purposes of this Section, any
spoiled votes, illegible votes, defective votes and abstinences shall be
deemed to be votes not cast.    ARTICLE 11  RECIPROCAL CHANGES, ETC. IN
RESPECT OF CCO COMMON STOCK  11.1 (a) Each holder of an Exchangeable Share
acknowledges that the  Support Agreement provides, in part, that CCo will
not:   (i) issue or distribute shares of CCo Common Stock (or  securities

Common Stock; or   (iii) reclassify or otherwise change the shares of CCo
Common  Stock or effect an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or  other

the rights of the holders of, the  Exchangeable Shares; and   (v) the same
or an economically equivalent change is  simultaneously made to, or in the
rights of the holders  of, the Exchangeable Shares.   The Support Agreement
further provides, in part, that, with the exception of certain ministerial
amendments, the aforesaid provisions of the Support Agreement shall not be
changed without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given
in accordance with Article 10 of these share provisions.    ARTICLE 12

will take all such actions and do all such things as shall be necessary or

to the Corporation,  are required for the purpose of curing or correcting
any  ambiguity or defect or inconsistent provision or clerical  omission or

amending such instructions.   The materials referred to above are to be
provided by CCo to the Trustee, but shall be subject to review and comment by
the Trustee.   For the purpose of determining Holder Votes to which a Holder
is entitled in respect of any such CCo Meeting or CCo Consent, the number
of Exchangeable Shares owned of record by the Holder shall be determined at
the close of business on the record date established by CCo or by applicable
law for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at such CCo
Meeting or to give written consent in connection with such CCo Consent. CCo
will notify the Trustee in writing of any decision of the board of directors
of CCo with respect to the calling of any such CCo Meeting or the seeking of
any such CCo    D-6   Consent and shall provide all necessary
information and materials to the Trustee in each case promptly and in any
event in sufficient time to enable the Trustee to perform its obligations
contemplated by this Section 4.3.  4.4 COPIES OF STOCKHOLDER INFORMATION

all interim and annual financial statements) and other written communications
that are to be distributed from time to time to holders of CCo Common Stock
in sufficient quantities and in sufficient time so as to enable the Trustee
to send those materials to each Holder, to the extent possible, at the same
time as such materials are first sent to holders of CCo Common Stock. The
Trustee will mail or otherwise send to each Holder, at the expense of CCo,
copies of all such materials (and all materials specifically directed to the
Holders or to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders by CCo) received by
the Trustee from CCo, to the extent possible, at the same time as such

make copies of all such materials available for inspection by any Holder at
the Trustee\'s principal transfer office in the cities of Calgary and
Toronto.  4.5 OTHER MATERIALS   Immediately after receipt by CCo or any

information and material), CCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to the Trustee copies thereof in sufficient quantities so
as to enable the Trustee to forward such material (unless the same has been
provided directly to Holders by such third party) to each Holder as soon as
possible thereafter. As soon as practicable after receipt thereof, the
Trustee will mail or otherwise send to each Holder, at the expense of CCo,
copies of all such materials received by the Trustee from CCo. The Trustee
will also make copies of all such materials available for inspection by any
Holder at the Trustee\'s principal transfer office in the cities of

shall, (i) prior to each annual, general or special CCo Meeting or the

such List shall be delivered to the Trustee promptly after receipt by CCo Sub
of such request or the record date for such meeting or seeking of consent, as

Trustee to perform its obligations under this agreement. CCo agrees to give
CCo Sub written notice (with a copy to the Trustee) of the calling of any CCo
Meeting or the seeking of any CCo Consent, together with the record dates
therefor, sufficiently prior to the date of the calling of such meeting or
seeking of such consent so as to enable CCo Sub to perform its obligations
under this Section 4.6.    D-7   4.7 ENTITLEMENT TO DIRECT VOTES  
Any Holder named in a List prepared in connection with any CCo Meeting or any
CCo Consent will be entitled (i) to instruct the Trustee in the
manner described in Section 4.3 hereof with respect to the exercise of the
Holder Votes to which such Holder is entitled or (ii) to attend such meeting
and personally to exercise thereat (or to exercise with respect to any
written consent), as the proxy of the Trustee, the Holder Votes to which such
Holder is entitled.  4.8 VOTING BY TRUSTEE, AND ATTENDANCE OF TRUSTEE
REPRESENTATIVE, AT MEETING   (a) In connection with each CCo Meeting and CCo

accordance with  the instructions received from a Holder pursuant to Section
4.3  hereof, the Holder Votes as to which such Holder is entitled to  direct
the vote (or any lesser number thereof as may be set forth  in the
instructions); provided, however, that such written  instructions are
received by the Trustee from the Holder prior to  the time and date fixed by
it for receipt of such instructions in  the notice given by the Trustee to
the Holder pursuant to Section  4.3 hereof.   (b) The Trustee shall cause
such representatives as are empowered by  it to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the Trustee, proxies for  Voting Rights to attend each CCo Meeting. Upon
submission by a  Holder (or its designee) of identification satisfactory to
the  Trustee\'s representatives, and at the Holder\'s request, such 
representatives shall sign and deliver to such Holder (or its  designee) a
proxy to exercise personally the Holder Votes as to  which such Holder is
otherwise entitled hereunder to direct the  vote, if such Holder either:  
(i) has not previously given the Trustee instructions pursuant  to Section
4.3 hereof in respect of such CCo Meeting, or   (ii) submits to the
Trustee\'s representatives written  revocation of any such previous
instructions.   At such CCo Meeting, the Holder exercising such Holder Votes

of any matter, question or proposition, to vote by way of ballot at the
meeting in respect of any matter, question or proposition and to vote at such

VOTING RIGHTS   Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions, all of the rights of a Holder with respect to the Holder
Votes exercisable in respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such Holder,
including the right to instruct the Trustee as to the voting of or to vote
personally such Holder Votes, shall be deemed to be surrendered by the Holder
to CCo, and such Holder Votes and the Voting Rights represented thereby shall
cease and be terminated immediately, upon the delivery by such Holder to the
Trustee of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares in
connection with the exercise by the Holder of the Exchange Put Right or the
occurrence of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for shares of CCo
Common Stock, as specified in Article 5 hereof (unless in any case CCo or CCo

or upon the redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 6 or
Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, or upon the effective date of

the Holders:   (a) the Exchange Put Right; and   (b) the Automatic
Exchange Rights,  all in accordance with the provisions of this agreement
and the Exchangeable Share Provisions, as the case may be. CCo hereby
acknowledges receipt from the Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of the
Holders of good and valuable consideration (and the adequacy thereof) for the
grant of the Exchange Put Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights by CCo to
the Trustee. During the term of the Trust and subject to the terms and
conditions of this agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with
full legal ownership of the Exchange Put Right and the Automatic Exchange

Holders all of the rights and powers of an owner with respect to the Exchange
Put Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights, provided that the Trustee

the Holders in accordance with the provisions of this  agreement; and   (d)

created pursuant to  this agreement.    D-9   5.2 LEGENDED SHARE
CERTIFICATES   CCo Sub will cause each certificate representing Exchangeable

Put Right in respect of the Exchangeable Shares  held by a Holder; and  
(b) the Automatic Exchange Rights.  5.3 GENERAL EXERCISE OF EXCHANGE PUT
RIGHT   The Exchange Put Right shall be and remain vested in and exercised
by the Trustee. Subject to Section 7.15 hereof, the Trustee shall exercise
the Exchange Put Right only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to
this Article 5 from Holders entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the
exercise thereof. To the extent that no instructions are received from a
Holder with respect to the Exchange Put Right, the Trustee shall not exercise
or permit the exercise of the Exchange Put Right.  5.4 PURCHASE PRICE  
The purchase price payable by CCo (or CCo Holdco, in the case of a purchase
by CCo Holdco) for each Exchangeable Share to be purchased by CCo or CCo
Holdco (as the case may be) under the Exchange Put Right shall be the
amount determined under the Exchangeable Share Provisions. The applicable
Exchangeable Share Price for each such Exchangeable Share so purchased may be
satisfied only by CCo\'s issuing and delivering or issuing and causing to be
delivered by CCo Holdco to the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Holder, the
applicable Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total applicable
Exchangeable Share Price.  5.5 EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXCHANGE PUT
RIGHT   Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, a Holder shall
be entitled to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Put Right with
respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name
of such Holder on the books of CCo Sub. To cause the exercise of the Exchange
Put Right by the Trustee, the Holder shall comply with the provisions of
Article 8 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. The surrender by the Holder
of Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Exchangeable
Share Provisions shall constitute the representation, warranty and covenant
of the Holder that the Exchangeable Shares so surrendered are sold to CCo or
CCo Holdco, as the case may be, are free and clear of any lien, encumbrance,
security interest or adverse claim or interest.  5.6 DELIVERY OF
EXCHANGEABLE SHARE CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF EXERCISE   Promptly after
receipt of the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the
Holder desires CCo or CCo Holdco to purchase under the Exchange Put Right
(together with such documents and instruments of transfer and a
duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Put Right), duly
endorsed for transfer to CCo (or CCo Holdco as CCo may direct), the Trustee
shall notify CCo and CCo Sub of its receipt of the same, which notice to CCo
and CCo Sub shall constitute exercise of the Exchange Put Right by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holder of such Exchangeable Shares, and CCo shall
immediately thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for
delivery to the Holder of such Exchangeable Shares (or to such other persons,
if any, properly designated by such Holder), the Exchangeable Share
Consideration deliverable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange Put
Right; provided, however, that no such delivery shall be made unless and
until the Holder requesting the same    D-10   shall have paid (or
provided evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, CCo Sub and CCo of the payment
of) the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.8 of this
agreement. Immediately upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to CCo and
CCo Sub of the exercise of the Exchange Put Right, as provided in
this Section 5.6, (i) the closing of the transaction of purchase and
sale contemplated by the Exchange Put Right shall be deemed to have occurred,
(ii) CCo shall be required to take all action necessary to permit it to
occur, including delivery to the Trustee of the relevant Exchangeable
Share Consideration, no later than the close of business on the third
Business Day following the receipt by the Trustee of notice, certificates and
other documents as aforesaid and (iii) the Holder of such Exchangeable Shares
shall be deemed to have transferred to CCo (or CCo Holdco as CCo may direct)
all of its right, title and interest in and to such Exchangeable Shares and
the related interest in the Trust Estate, shall cease to be a holder of such
Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights
of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his
proportionate part of the total purchase price therefor, unless such
Exchangeable Share Consideration is not delivered by CCo to the Trustee by
the date specified above, in which case the rights of the Holder shall remain
unaffected with respect to such unpaid portion until such Exchangeable Share
Consideration is delivered by CCo and such holder is paid his proportionate
part of the total purchase price. Concurrently with such Holder ceasing to be
a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Holder shall be considered and deemed
for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of CCo Common Stock delivered
to it pursuant to the Exchange Put Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
until the Exchangeable Share Consideration is delivered to the Holder, the
Holder shall be deemed to still be a holder of the sold Exchangeable Shares
for purposes of the Voting Rights with respect thereto.  5.7 EXERCISE OF
EXCHANGE PUT RIGHT SUBSEQUENT TO RETRACTION   In the event that a Holder has
exercised its right under Article 6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to
require CCo Sub to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the
Holder (the "Retracted Shares") and is notified by CCo Sub pursuant to
Section 6.6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions that CCo Sub will not be
permitted as a result of liquidity or solvency provisions of applicable law
to redeem all such Retracted Shares, subject to receipt by the Trustee of
written notice to that effect from CCo Sub and provided that CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the case may be, shall not have exercised the Retraction
Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares and that the Holder has not
revoked the retraction request delivered by the Holder to CCo Sub pursuant to
Section 6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the retraction request will
constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the Holder to the
Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Put Right with
respect to those Retracted Shares which CCo Sub is unable to redeem. In any
such event, CCo Sub hereby agrees with the Trustee and in favour of the
Holder immediately to notify the Trustee of such prohibition against CCo
Sub\'s redeeming all of the Retracted Shares and immediately to forward or
cause to be forwarded to the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the
Holder to CCo Sub or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares
(including without limitation a copy of the retraction request delivered
pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in connection
with such proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares, and the Trustee will
thereupon exercise the Exchange Put Right with respect to the Retracted
Shares which CCo Sub is not permitted to redeem and will require CCo or CCo
Holdco, as the case may be, to purchase such shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 5.  5.8 STAMP OR OTHER TRANSFER TAXES   Upon
any sale of Exchangeable Shares to CCo pursuant to the Exchange Put Right or
the Automatic Exchange Rights, the share certificate or
certificates representing CCo Common Stock to be delivered in connection with
the payment of the total purchase price therefor shall be issued in the name
of the Holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or in such names as such
Holder may otherwise direct    D-11    in writing without charge to
the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold, provided, however, that such
Holder:   (a) shall pay (and none of CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco, ECo or the 
Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp,  transfer or other
similar taxes that may be payable, or income  taxes that may be required to
be withheld, in respect of any  transfer involved in the issuance or delivery
of such shares to a  person other than such Holder; or   (b) shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Trustee, CCo  and CCo Sub that such
taxes, if any, have been paid.  CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco and the Trustee (as
directed in writing by CCo) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this agreement to any Holder such
amounts as CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco or the Trustee is required or permitted
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Income Tax Act
(Canada), the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of
provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended or
succeeded unless such Holder provides to CCo and the Trustee certificates or
such other assurances as are provided for under the Income Tax Act (Canada),
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or such other applicable
taxation provisions. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided
that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority as and when required. To the extent that the amount so required or
permitted to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a Holder exceeds
the cash portion, if any, of the consideration otherwise payable to the
Holder, CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco and the Trustee are hereby authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco or the
Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or
withholding requirement and CCo, CCo Sub, CCo Holdco or the Trustee, as the
case may be, shall notify the Holder and remit to such Holder any unapplied
balance of the net proceeds of such sale.  5.9 QUALIFICATION OF CCO COMMON
STOCK   CCo covenants with the Trustee for the benefit of Holders that if
any shares of CCo Common Stock to be issued and delivered pursuant to the
Exchange Put Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights require registration or
qualification with or approval of or the filing of any document including any
prospectus or similar document, the taking of any proceeding with or the
obtaining of any order, ruling or consent from any governmental or regulatory
authority under any Canadian or United States federal, provincial or state
law or regulation or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any regulatory
authority, or the fulfillment of any other legal requirement (collectively,
the "Applicable Laws") before such shares may be issued and delivered by CCo
to the initial holder thereof (other than CCo Sub) or in order that such
shares may be freely traded thereafter (other than any restrictions on
transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person" of CCo for purposes
of Canadian provincial securities law or an "affiliate" of CCo for purposes
of United States federal or state securities law), CCo will in good faith
take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary and within its
power to cause such shares of CCo Common Stock to be and remain duly
registered, qualified or approved to the extent expressly provided in the
Combination Agreement. CCo represents and warrants that it has in good faith
taken all actions and done all things as are necessary under Applicable Laws
as they exist on the date hereof to cause the shares of CCo Common Stock to
be issued and delivered pursuant to the Exchange Put Right and the Automatic
Exchange Rights and to be freely tradeable thereafter (other
than restrictions on transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person"
of CCo for the purposes of Canadian provincial securities law or an
"affiliate" of CCo for the purposes of United States federal or state
securities law). CCo will in good faith    D-12   take all such actions
and do all such things as are necessary and within its power to cause all
shares of CCo Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to the Exchange Put Right
or the Automatic Exchange Rights to be listed, quoted or posted for trading
on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which such shares are listed,
quoted or posted for trading at such time.  5.10 RESERVATION OF SHARES OF
CCO COMMON STOCK   CCo hereby represents, warrants and covenants with the
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders that it has irrevocably reserved for
issuance and will at all times keep available, free from pre-emptive and
other rights, out of its authorized and unissued capital stock such number of
shares of CCo Common Stock:   (a) as is equal to the sum of   (i) the
number of Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding  from time to time,
and   (ii) the number of Exchangeable Shares issuable upon the  exercise of
all rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares  outstanding from time to time;
and   (b) as are now and may hereafter be required to enable and permit
CCo  Sub to meet its obligations hereunder, under the Articles of 
Incorporation of CCo, under the Support Agreement, under the  Exchangeable
Share Provisions and under any other security or  commitment pursuant to the
Arrangement with respect to which CCo  may now or hereafter be required to
issue shares of CCo Common  Stock.  5.11 AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE ON LIQUIDATION
OF CCO   (a) CCo will give the Trustee written notice of each of the
following  events at the time set forth below:   (i) in the event of any
determination by the board of  directors of CCo to institute voluntary
liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up proceedings with respect to CCo  or
to effect any other distribution of assets of CCo among  its stockholders for
the purpose of winding-up its  affairs, at least 60 days prior to the
proposed effective  date of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or
other  distribution; and   (ii) immediately, upon the earlier of   (A)
receipt by CCo of notice of, and   (B) CCo otherwise becoming aware of  
any threatened or instituted claim, suit, petition or other  proceedings with
respect to the involuntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of CCo or
to effect any other  distribution of assets of CCo among its stockholders for
the  purpose of winding up its affairs.   (b) Immediately following receipt
by the Trustee from CCo of notice  of any event (a "Liquidation Event")
contemplated by Section  5.11(a) above, the Trustee will give notice thereof
to the  Holders. Such notice will be provided by CCo to the Trustee and 
shall    D-13    include a brief description of the automatic exchange
of  Exchangeable Shares for shares of CCo Common Stock provided for  in
Section 5.11(c) below.   (c) In order that the Holders will be able to
participate on a pro  rata basis with the holders of CCo Common Stock in
the  distribution of assets of CCo in connection with a Liquidation  Event,
immediately prior to the effective time (the "Liquidation  Event Effective
Time") of a Liquidation Event, all of the then  outstanding Exchangeable
Shares shall be automatically exchanged  for shares of CCo Common Stock. To
effect such automatic  exchange, CCo or, at the option of CCo, CCo Holdco,
shall be  deemed to have purchased each Exchangeable Share outstanding 
immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Time and  held by
Holders, and each Holder shall be deemed to have sold the  Exchangeable
Shares held by it at such time, for a purchase price  per share equal to the
Exchangeable Share Price applicable at  such time. In connection with such
automatic exchange, CCo will  provide to the Trustee an Officer\'s
Certificate setting forth the  calculation of the Exchangeable Share Price
for each Exchangeable  Share.   (d) The closing of the transaction of
purchase and sale contemplated  by Section 5.11(c) above shall be deemed to
have occurred  immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Time,
and  each Holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have  transferred
to CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may be, all of the  Holder\'s right, title
and interest in and to such Exchangeable  Shares and the related interest in
the Trust Estate and shall  cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares,
and CCo or CCo  Holdco, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Holder the 
Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable upon the automatic  exchange of
Exchangeable Shares. Concurrently with such Holder\'s  ceasing to be a holder
of Exchangeable Shares, the Holder shall  be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the  shares of CCo Common Stock issued to it
pursuant to the automatic  exchange of Exchangeable Shares for CCo Common
Stock, and the  certificates held by the Holder previously representing the 
Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Holder with CCo or CCo  Holdco, as the
case may be, pursuant to such automatic exchange  shall thereafter be deemed
to represent the shares of CCo Common  Stock issued to the Holder by CCo or
CCo Holdco, as the case may  be, pursuant to such automatic exchange. Upon
the request of a  Holder and the surrender by the Holder of Exchangeable
Share  certificates deemed to represent shares of CCo Common Stock, duly 
endorsed in blank and accompanied by such instruments of transfer  as CCo may
reasonably require, CCo or CCo Holdco, as the case may  be, shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Holder  certificates representing the shares of
CCo Common Stock of which  the Holder is the holder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until  each Holder is actually entered on the register of holders
of CCo  Common Stock, such Holder shall be deemed to still be a holder of 
the transferred Exchangeable Shares for purposes of all Voting  Rights with
respect thereto.    ARTICLE 6  RESTRICTIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CCO SPECIAL
VOTING [PREFERRED] STOCK   During the term of this agreement, CCo will not
issue any shares of CCo Special Voting [Preferred] Stock in addition to the
Voting Share.    D-14    ARTICLE 7  CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE  7.1
POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TRUSTEE  The rights, powers and authorities of the
Trustee under this agreement, in its capacity as trustee of the Trust, shall
include:   (a) receipt and deposit of the Voting Share from CCo as trustee
for  and on behalf of the Holders in accordance with the provisions of  this
agreement;   (b) granting proxies and distributing materials to Holders as 
provided in this agreement;   (c) voting the Holder Votes in accordance with
the provisions of this  agreement;   (d) receiving the grant of the
Exchange Put Right and the Automatic  Exchange Rights from CCo as trustee for
and on behalf of the  Holders in accordance with the provisions of this
agreement;   (e) exercising the Exchange Put Right and enforcing the benefit
of  the Automatic Exchange Rights, in each case in accordance with  the
provisions of this agreement, and in connection therewith  receiving from
Holders Exchangeable Shares and other requisite  documents and distributing
to such Holders the shares of CCo  Common Stock and cheques, if any, to which
such Holders are  entitled upon the exercise of the Exchange Put Right or
pursuant  to the Automatic Exchange Rights, as the case may be;   (f)
holding title to the Trust Estate;   (g) investing any moneys forming, from
time to time, a part of the  Trust Estate as provided in this agreement;  
(h) taking action at the direction of a Holder or Holders to enforce  the
obligations of CCo under this agreement; and   (i) taking such other actions
and doing such other things as are  specifically provided in this
agreement.   In the exercise of such rights, powers and authorities, the
Trustee shall have (and is granted) such incidental and additional rights,
powers and authority not in conflict with any of the provisions of this
agreement as the Trustee, acting in good faith and in the reasonable exercise
of its discretion, may deem necessary, appropriate or desirable to effect the
purpose of the Trust. Any exercise of such discretionary rights, powers and
authorities by the Trustee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all
persons. For greater certainty, the Trustee shall have only those duties as
are set out specifically in this agreement. The Trustee in exercising its
rights, powers, duties and authorities hereunder shall act honestly and in
good faith with a view to the best interests of the Holders and shall
exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent trustee
would exercise in comparable circumstances. The Trustee shall not be bound to
give any notice or do or take any act, action or proceeding by virtue of the
powers conferred on it hereby unless and until it shall be specifically
required to do so under the terms hereof nor shall the Trustee be required to
take any notice of, or to do or to take any act, action or proceeding as a
result of any default or breach of any provision hereunder, unless and until
notified in writing of such default or breach, which notices shall distinctly
specify the default or breach desired to be brought to the attention of   
D-15   the Trustee and in the absence of such notice the Trustee may for
all purposes of this agreement conclusively assume that no default or breach
has been made in the observance or performance of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein.  7.2 NO
CONFLICT OF INTEREST   The Trustee represents to CCo Sub and CCo that at the
date of execution and delivery of this agreement there exists no material
conflict of interest in the role of the Trustee as a fiduciary hereunder and
the role of the Trustee in any other capacity. The Trustee shall, within 90
days after it becomes aware that such a material conflict of interest exists,
either eliminate such material conflict of interest or resign in the manner
and with the effect specified in Article 10 hereof. If, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2, the Trustee has such a material
conflict of interest, the validity and enforceability of this agreement shall
not be affected in any manner whatsoever by reason only of the existence of
such material conflict of interest. If the Trustee contravenes the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.2, any interested party may apply to the
superior court of the province in which CCo Sub has its registered office for
an order that the Trustee be replaced as trustee hereunder.  7.3 DEALINGS
WITH TRANSFER AGENTS, REGISTRARS, ETC.   CCo Sub and CCo irrevocably
authorize the Trustee, from time to time,  to:   (a) consult, communicate
and otherwise deal with the respective  registrars and transfer agents, and
with any such subsequent  registrar or transfer agent, of the Exchangeable
Shares and CCo  Common Stock; and   (b) requisition, from time to time,  
(i) from any such registrar or transfer agent any information  readily
available from the records maintained by it which  the Trustee may reasonably
require for the discharge of  its duties and responsibilities under this
agreement, and   (ii) from the transfer agent of CCo Common Stock, and any 
subsequent transfer agent of such shares, to complete the  exercise from time
to time of the Exchange Put Right and  the Automatic Exchange Rights in the
manner specified in  Article 5 hereof, the share certificates issuable upon 
such exercise.   CCo Sub and CCo irrevocably authorize their respective
registrars and transfer agents to comply with all such requests. CCo
covenants that it will supply its transfer agent with duly executed share
certificates for the purpose of completing the exercise from time to time of
the Exchange Put Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights, in each case
pursuant to Article 5 hereof.  7.4 BOOKS AND RECORDS   The Trustee shall
keep available for inspection by CCo and CCo Sub, at the Trustee\'s principal
transfer office in Calgary, Alberta, correct and complete books and records
of account relating to the Trustee\'s actions under this agreement, including
without limitation all information relating to mailings and instructions to
and from Holders and all transactions pursuant to the Voting Rights, the
Exchange Put Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights for the term of this
agreement. On or before March 31, 2002, and on or before March 31 in every
year thereafter, so long as the Voting Share is on deposit with the Trustee,
the Trustee shall transmit to CCo and CCo Sub a brief report, dated as of the
preceding December 31, with respect to:    D-16     (a) the property
and funds comprising the Trust Estate as of that  date;   (b) the number of
exercises of the Exchange Put Right, if any, and  the aggregate number of
Exchangeable Shares received by the  Trustee on behalf of Holders in
consideration of the issue and  delivery by CCo of shares of CCo Common Stock
in connection with  the Exchange Put Right, during the calendar year ended on
such  date; and   (c) all other actions taken by the Trustee in the
performance of its  duties under this agreement which it had not previously
reported.  7.5 INCOME TAX RETURNS AND REPORTS   The Trustee shall, to the
extent necessary, prepare and file on behalf of the Trust appropriate United
States and Canadian income tax returns and any other returns or reports as
may be required by applicable law or pursuant to the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange or other trading system through which the
Exchangeable Shares are traded and, in connection therewith, may obtain the
advice and assistance of such experts as the Trustee may consider necessary
or advisable. If requested by the Trustee, CCo shall retain such experts for
purposes of providing such advice and assistance.  7.6 INDEMNIFICATION PRIOR
TO CERTAIN ACTIONS BY TRUSTEE   The Trustee shall exercise any or all of the
rights, duties, powers or authorities vested in it by this agreement at the
request, order or direction of any Holder upon such Holder\'s furnishing to
the Trustee reasonable funding, security and indemnity against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Trustee therein or
thereby; provided that no Holder shall be obligated to furnish to the Trustee
any such funding, security or indemnity in connection with the exercise by
the Trustee of any of its rights, duties, powers and authorities with respect
to the Voting Share pursuant to Article 4 hereof, subject to Section 7.15
hereof, and with respect to the Exchange Put Right pursuant to Article 5
hereof, subject to Section 7.15 hereof, and with respect to the Automatic
Exchange Rights pursuant to Article 5 hereof, subject to Section 7.15 hereof.
None of the provisions contained in this agreement shall require the Trustee
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
exercise of any of its rights, powers, duties or authorities unless funded,
given funds, security and indemnified as aforesaid.  7.7 ACTIONS BY
HOLDERS   No Holder shall have the right to institute any action, suit
or proceeding or to exercise any other remedy authorized by this agreement
for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights or for the execution of any
trust or power hereunder unless the Holder has requested the Trustee to take
or institute such action, suit or proceeding and furnished the Trustee with
the funding, security and indemnity referred to in Section 7.6 hereof and the
Trustee shall have failed to act within a reasonable time thereafter. In such
case, but not otherwise, the Holder shall be entitled to take proceedings in
any court of competent jurisdiction such as the Trustee might have taken; it
being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any
right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights
hereby created by any such action, or to enforce any right hereunder or under
the Voting Rights, the Exchange Put Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights,
except subject to the conditions and in the manner herein provided, and that
all powers and trusts hereunder shall be exercised and all proceedings at law
shall be instituted, had and maintained by the Trustee, except only as herein
provided, and in any event for the equal benefit of all Holders.   
D-17   7.8 RELIANCE UPON DECLARATIONS   The Trustee shall not be
considered to be in contravention of any of its rights, powers, duties and
authorities hereunder if, when required, it acts and relies in good faith
upon lists, mailing labels, notices, statutory declarations, certificates,
opinions, reports or other papers or documents furnished pursuant to the
provisions hereof or required by the Trustee to be furnished to it in the
exercise of its rights, powers, duties and authorities hereunder, and such
lists, mailing labels, notices, statutory declarations, certificates,
opinions, reports or other papers or documents comply with the provisions of
Section 7.9 hereof, if applicable, and with any other applicable provisions
of this agreement.  7.9 EVIDENCE AND AUTHORITY TO TRUSTEE   CCo Sub and/or
CCo shall furnish to the Trustee evidence of compliance with the conditions
provided for in this agreement relating to any action or step required or
permitted to be taken by CCo Sub and/or CCo or the Trustee under this
agreement or as a result of any obligation imposed under this agreement,
including, without limitation, in respect of the Voting Rights or
the Exchange Put Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights and the taking of any
other action to be taken by the Trustee at the request of or on the
application of CCo Sub and/or CCo forthwith if and when:   (a) such
evidence is required by any other Section of this agreement  to be furnished
to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of  this Section 7.9; or   (b)
the Trustee, in the exercise of its rights, powers, duties and  authorities
under this agreement, gives CCo Sub and/or CCo  written notice requiring it
to furnish such evidence in relation  to any particular action or obligation
specified in such notice.   Such evidence shall consist of an Officer\'s
Certificate of CCo Sub and/or CCo or a statutory declaration or a certificate
made by persons entitled to sign an Officer\'s Certificate stating that any
such condition has been complied with in accordance with the terms of this
agreement.   Whenever such evidence relates to a matter other than the
Voting Rights, the Exchange Put Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, and
except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such evidence may consist
of a report or opinion of any solicitor, auditor, accountant, appraiser,
valuer, engineer or other expert or any other person whose qualifications
give authority to a statement made by him, provided that, if such report or
opinion is furnished by a director, officer or employee of CCo Sub and/or
CCo, it shall be in the form of an Officer\'s Certificate or a statutory
declaration.   Each statutory declaration, certificate, opinion or report
furnished to the Trustee as evidence of compliance with a condition provided
for in this agreement shall include a statement by the person giving the
evidence:   (i) declaring that such person has read and understands the 
provisions of this agreement relating to the condition in  question;   (ii)
describing the nature and scope of the examination or  investigation upon
which such person based the statutory  declaration, certificate, statement or
opinion; and   (iii) declaring that such person has made such examination
or  investigation as such person believes is necessary to  enable such
person to make the statements or give the  opinions contained or expressed
therein.    D-18   7.10 EXPERTS, ADVISERS AND AGENTS   The Trustee
may:   (a) in relation to these presents act and rely on the opinion or 
advice of or information obtained from or prepared by any  solicitor,
auditor, accountant, appraiser, valuer, engineer or  other expert, whether
retained by the Trustee or by CCo Sub  and/or CCo or otherwise, and may
employ such assistants as may be  necessary to the proper determination and
discharge of its powers  and duties and determination of its rights hereunder
and may pay  proper and reasonable compensation for all such legal and
other  advice or assistance as aforesaid; and   (b) employ such agents and
other assistants as it may reasonably  require for the proper determination
and discharge of its powers  and duties hereunder, and may pay reasonable
remuneration for all  services performed for it (and shall be entitled to
receive  reasonable remuneration for all services performed by it) in the 
discharge of the trusts hereof and compensation for all  disbursements, costs
and expenses made or incurred by it in the  determination and discharge of
its duties hereunder and in the  management of the Trust.  7.11 INVESTMENT
OF MONEYS HELD BY TRUSTEE   Unless otherwise provided in this agreement, any
moneys held by or on behalf of the Trustee which under the terms of this
agreement may or ought to be invested or which may be on deposit with the
Trustee or which may be in the hands of the Trustee, may be invested and
reinvested in the name or under the control of the Trustee in securities in
which, under the laws of the Province of Alberta, trustees are authorized to
invest trust moneys; provided that such securities are stated to mature
within two years after their purchase by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall
so invest such moneys on the written direction of CCo Sub. Pending the
investment of any moneys as hereinbefore provided, such moneys may be
deposited in the name of the Trustee in any chartered bank in Canada or, with
the consent of CCo Sub, in the deposit department of the Trustee or any other
loan or trust company authorized to accept deposits under the laws of Canada
or any province thereof at the rate of interest then current on similar
deposits.  7.12 TRUSTEE NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE SECURITY   The Trustee shall
not be required to give any bond or security in respect of the execution of
the trusts, rights, duties, powers and authorities of this agreement or
otherwise in respect of the premises.  7.13 TRUSTEE NOT BOUND TO ACT ON
REQUEST   Except as in this agreement otherwise specifically provided, the
Trustee shall not be bound to act in accordance with any direction or request
of CCo Sub and/or CCo or of the directors thereof until a duly authenticated
copy of the instrument or resolution containing such direction or request
shall have been delivered to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be empowered
to act and rely upon any such copy purporting to be authenticated and
believed by the Trustee to be genuine.  7.14 AUTHORITY TO CARRY ON
BUSINESS   The Trustee represents to CCo Sub and CCo that at the date of
execution and delivery by it of this agreement it is authorized to carry on
the business of a trust company in the Province of Alberta but if,
notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.14, it ceases to be so
authorized to carry on business, the validity and enforceability of this
agreement and the Voting Rights, the Exchange Put Right and the   
D-19    Automatic Exchange Rights shall not be affected in any manner
whatsoever by reason only of such event; provided, however, the Trustee
shall, within 90 days after ceasing to be authorized to carry on the business
of a trust company in the Province of Alberta, either become so authorized or
resign in the manner and with the effect specified in Article 10
hereof.  7.15 CONFLICTING CLAIMS   If conflicting claims or demands are
made or asserted with respect to any interest of any Holder in any
Exchangeable Shares, including any disagreement between the heirs,
representatives, successors or assigns succeeding to all or any part of the
interest of any Holder in any Exchangeable Shares resulting in conflicting
claims or demands being made in connection with such interest, then the
Trustee shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to refuse to recognize or
to comply with any such claim or demand. In so refusing, the Trustee may
elect not to exercise any Voting Rights, Exchange Put Right or Automatic
Exchange Rights subject to such conflicting claims or demands and, in so
doing, the Trustee shall not be or become liable to any person on account
of such election or its failure or refusal to comply with any such
conflicting claims or demands. The Trustee shall be entitled to continue to
refrain from acting and to refuse to act until:   (a) the rights of all
adverse claimants with respect to the Voting  Rights, Exchange Put Right or
Automatic Exchange Rights subject  to such conflicting claims or demands have
been adjudicated by a  final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;
or   (b) all differences with respect to the Voting Rights, the Exchange 
Put Right or Automatic Exchange Rights subject to such  conflicting claims or
demands have been conclusively settled by a  valid written agreement binding
on all such adverse claimants,  and the Trustee shall have been furnished
with an executed copy  of such agreement.   If the Trustee elects to
recognize any claim or comply with any demand made by any such adverse
claimant, it may in its discretion require such claimant to furnish such
surety bond or other security satisfactory to the Trustee as it shall deem
appropriate fully to indemnify it as between all conflicting claims or
demands.  7.16 ACCEPTANCE OF TRUST   The Trustee hereby accepts the Trust
created and provided for by and in this agreement and agrees to perform the
same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth and to hold all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred hereby and by law in trust for the various
persons who shall from time to time be Holders, subject to all the terms and
conditions herein set forth.    ARTICLE 8  COMPENSATION   CCo and CCo
Sub jointly and severally agree to pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation
for all of the services rendered by it under this agreement and will
reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses (including but not limited
to taxes, compensation paid to experts, agents and advisors, and travel
expenses) and disbursements, including the cost and expense of any suit or
litigation of any character and any proceedings before any
governmental agency, reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection with
its rights and duties under this agreement; provided that CCo and CCo Sub
shall have no obligation to reimburse the Trustee for any expenses or
disbursements paid, incurred or suffered by the Trustee in any suit or
litigation in which the Trustee is determined to have acted in bad faith or
with negligence or willful misconduct.    D-20     ARTICLE 9 
INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  9.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE
TRUSTEE   CCo and CCo Sub jointly and severally agree to indemnify and
hold harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees and
agents appointed and acting in accordance with this agreement (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against all claims, losses, damages, costs,
penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable expenses of
the Trustee\'s legal counsel) which, without fraud, negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith on the part of such Indemnified Party, may be paid,
incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason of or as a result of
the Trustee\'s acceptance or administration of the Trust, its compliance with
its duties set forth in this agreement, or any written or oral instructions
delivered to the Trustee by CCo or CCo Sub pursuant hereto. In no case shall
CCo or CCo Sub be liable under this indemnity for any claim against any of
the Indemnified Parties unless CCo and CCo Sub shall be notified by the
Trustee of the written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced
against the Indemnified Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified
Parties shall have received any such written assertion of a claim or shall
have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving
information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Subject to (ii) below,
CCo and CCo Sub shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the
defense and, if CCo or CCo Sub so elect at any time after receipt of
such notice, either of them may assume the defense of any suit brought to
enforce any such claim. The Trustee shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such suit and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Trustee unless:
(i) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by CCo or CCo Sub,
such authorization not to be unreasonably withheld; or (ii) the named parties
to any such suit include both the Trustee and CCo or CCo Sub and the Trustee
shall have been advised by counsel acceptable to CCo or CCo Sub that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Trustee that are different
from or in addition to those available to CCo or CCo Sub and that an actual
or potential conflict of interest exists (in which case CCo and CCo Sub shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of the
Trustee, but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Trustee and the termination of the trust.  9.2 LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY   The Trustee shall not be held liable for any loss which may
occur by reason of depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate
or any loss incurred on any investment of funds pursuant to this agreement,
except to the extent that such loss is attributable to the fraud, negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee.    ARTICLE
10  CHANGE OF TRUSTEE  10.1 RESIGNATION   The Trustee, or any trustee
hereafter appointed in accordance with the terms of this agreement, may at
any time resign by giving written notice of such resignation to CCo and CCo
Sub specifying the date on which it desires to resign, provided that such
notice shall never be given less than 60 days before such desired resignation
date unless CCo and CCo Sub otherwise agree and provided further that such
resignation shall not take effect until the date of the appointment of a
successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor
trustee in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Upon receiving such
notice of resignation, CCo and CCo Sub shall promptly appoint a successor
trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be
delivered to the resigning trustee and one    D-21   copy to the
successor trustee. Failing acceptance by a successor trustee, a successor
trustee may be appointed by an order of the superior court of the province in
which CCo Sub has its registered office upon application of one or more of
the parties hereto.  10.2 REMOVAL   The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter
appointed, may be removed with or without cause, at any time on 60 days prior
notice by written instrument executed by CCo and CCo Sub, in duplicate, one
copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and one copy to
the successor trustee; provided that, in connection with such removal,
provision is made for a replacement trustee similar to that contemplated in
Section 10.1.  10.3 SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE   Any successor trustee appointed as
provided under this agreement shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to CCo
and CCo Sub and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee
shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties
and obligations of its predecessor under this agreement, with like effect as
if originally named as trustee in this agreement. However, on the written
request of CCo and CCo Sub or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing
to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the
provisions of this agreement, execute and deliver an instrument transferring
to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing
to act. Upon the request of any such successor trustee, CCo, CCo Sub and such
predecessor trustee shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all
such rights and powers.  10.4 NOTICE OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE   Upon
acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided herein, CCo and
CCo Sub shall cause to be mailed notice of the succession of such trustee
hereunder to each Holder specified in a List. If CCo or CCo Sub shall fail to
cause such notice to be mailed within 10 days after acceptance of appointment
by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be
mailed at the expense of CCo and CCo Sub.    ARTICLE 11 
SUCCESSORS  11.1 CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF COMBINATION, ETC.  
Neither CCo nor CCo Sub shall enter into any transaction (whether by way of
reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, merger, transfer, sale,
lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking,
property and assets would become the property of any other Person or, in the
case of a merger, of the continuing corporation resulting therefrom, but may
do so if:   (a) such other Person or continuing corporation (the
"Successor"), by  operation of law, becomes, without further action, bound by
the  terms and provisions of this agreement or, if not so bound,  executes,
prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of  such transaction an
agreement supplemental hereto and such other  instruments (if any) as are
reasonably satisfactory to the  Trustee and in the opinion of legal counsel
to the Trustee are  necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by
the  Successor of liability for all moneys payable and property  deliverable
hereunder, the covenant of such Successor to    D-22    pay and deliver
or cause to be delivered the same and its  agreement to observe and perform
all the covenants and  obligations of CCo or CCo Sub, as the case may be,
under this  agreement; and   (b) such transaction shall, to the
satisfaction of the Trustee, be  upon such terms which substantially preserve
and do not impair in  any material respect any of the rights, duties, powers
and  authorities of the Trustee or of the Holders hereunder.  11.2 VESTING
OF POWERS IN SUCCESSOR   Whenever the conditions of Section 11.1 hereof have
been duly observed and performed, the Trustee, if required by Section 11.1
hereof, the Successor and CCo or CCo Sub, as the case may be, shall execute
and deliver the supplemental agreement provided for in Article 12 hereof, and
thereupon the Successor shall possess and from time to time may exercise each
and every right and power of CCo or CCo Sub, as the case may be, under this
agreement in the name of CCo or CCo Sub, as the case may be, or otherwise and
any act or proceeding by any provision of this agreement required to be done
or performed by the board of directors or any officers of CCo or CCo Sub may
be done and performed with like force and effect by the directors or officers
of such Successor.  11.3 WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES   Nothing herein shall
be construed as preventing the amalgamation or merger of any wholly-owned
subsidiary of CCo with or into CCo or the winding-up, liquidation or
dissolution of any wholly-owned subsidiary of CCo provided that all of the
assets of such subsidiary are transferred to CCo or another wholly-owned
subsidiary of CCo, and any such transactions are expressly permitted by this
Article 11.    ARTICLE 12  AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS  12.1
AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS, ETC.   Subject to Sections 12.2 and 12.4, this
agreement may not be amended, modified or waived except by an agreement in
writing executed by CCo Sub, CCo and the Trustee and approved by the Holders

of directors and the Trustee and its counsel  shall be of the opinion that
such amendments and modifications  will not be prejudicial to the interests
of the Holders as a  whole;   (c) making such changes or corrections which,
on the advice of  counsel to CCo Sub, CCo and the Trustee, are required for
the  purpose of curing or correcting any ambiguity or defect or 
inconsistent provision or clerical omission or mistake or  manifest error;
provided that the Trustee and its counsel and the  board of directors of each
of CCo Sub and CCo shall be of the  opinion that such changes or corrections
will not be prejudicial  to the interests of the Holders as a whole; or  
(d) making such changes as may be necessary or appropriate to  implement or
give effect to any assignment or assumption made  pursuant to Section 14.9
hereof.  12.3 MEETING TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS   CCo Sub, at the request of
CCo, shall call a meeting or meetings of the Holders for the purpose of

Stock or the Exchangeable Shares or both are in any way changed,
this agreement shall forthwith be amended and modified as necessary in order
that it shall apply with full force and effect, mutatis mutandis, to all new
securities into which CCo Common Stock or the Exchangeable Shares or both are
so changed, and the parties hereto shall execute and deliver a supplemental
agreement giving effect to and evidencing such necessary amendments and
modifications.  12.5 EXECUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS   From time to

Corporation 50 West San Fernando Street, 5th Floor, San Jose, California
95113   Encal Energy Ltd. 1800, 421 Seventh Avenue S.W. Calgary,
Alberta T2P 4K9  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of
the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as that term is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act")) of Encal Energy Ltd., a company existing under the laws of
Alberta ("ECo").   I understand that pursuant to an arrangement (the
"Arrangement") to be effected by Articles of Arrangement filed pursuant to
the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), each issued and outstanding common
share (a "ECo Common Share") of ECo will be exchanged for a number of non-
voting exchangeable shares of a subsidiary of CCo (the "Exchangeable
Shares"). The Exchangeable Shares will be exchangeable for shares of common
stock ("CCo Common Stock") of Calpine Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("CCo") pursuant to a Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement. I further
understand that the Arrangement is being entered into pursuant to a
Combination Agreement dated on or about February 7, 2001 (the "Combination
Agreement") by and between ECo and CCo.   I further understand that the
Arrangement will be treated for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling
of interests" in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles and that the staff of the SEC has issued certain guidelines that
should be followed to ensure the pooling of the entities.   In
consideration of the agreements contained herein, CCo\'s and ECo\'s reliance
on this letter in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement and for
other good and valuable    1   consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I hereby represent, warrant and
agree that, unless the Combination Agreement is terminated in circumstances
where the Arrangement is not completed, during the period commencing 30 days
prior to the Effective Date (as defined in the Combination Agreement) and
ending at such time as financial results that include at least 30 days of
post-combination combined operations of CCo and ECo after the Arrangement
shall have been published, I will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
or, as contemplated by Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135 as amended, of
the SEC, reduce my risk relative to any ECo Common Shares held by me or any
Exchangeable Shares or CCo Common Stock received in exchange therefor
except:   a) during the period beginning on the date 30 days prior to the 
Effective Date and ending on the Effective Date, I may transfer,  sell, put,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, or reduce my risk  relative to, up to a
number of shares equal to (x) 10% of my ECo  Common Shares held on the date
of any sale, less (y) the number  of such shares sold by me on and after
February 7, 2001, provided  that:   i) such disposition is required to
prevent expiry of options  granted pursuant to a ECo option plan;   ii) all
affiliate dispositions of all equivalent ECo Common  Shares by all affiliates
during the prescribed period do  not exceed 1,170,000 equivalent ECo Common
Shares as such  equivalent is calculated pursuant to the Arrangement (or 
the equivalent number of shares of CCo Common Stock); and   iii) before I
dispose of any ECo Common Shares or otherwise  reduce my risk relative to any
equivalent ECo Common  Shares during the period prescribed in this paragraph,
I  will consult with CCo who, in consultation with its  independent
accountants, will, as soon as reasonably  practicable, determine if such
disposition or risk  reduction transaction violates the conditions for 
pooling-of-interests accounting under U.S. generally  accepted accounting
principles. If the ECo Common Share  disposition or risk reduction
transaction is determined to  violate the conditions for pooling-of-interests
accounting  under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, I  agree
not to make the disposition or enter into the risk  reduction
transaction.  I agree not to transfer, sell, put, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, or direct or cause the sale, transfer or other disposition of, or
reduce my risk relative to, any Exchangeable Shares or shares of CCo Common
Stock received upon the exchange of such Exchangeable Shares (together, the
"Combination Shares") held by me or on my behalf or received by me during the
period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the date (the
"Expiration Date") CCo shall have publicly released a report in the form of a
quarterly earnings report, registration statement filed with the SEC, a
report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K or any other public
filing, statement or public announcement which includes the combined
financial results (including combined sales and net income) of CCo and ECo
for a period which includes at least 30 days of post-combination
combined operations of CCo and ECo following the Effective Date except:   
2     b) during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on 
the Expiration Date, I may transfer, sell, put, pledge or  otherwise dispose
of, or reduce my risk relative to, Combination  Shares equal to (x) 10% of my
ECo Common Shares held on the  effective date of the Arrangement, less (y)
the number of ECo  Common Shares sold by me on and after February 7, 2001,
provided  that:   i) such disposition is required to prevent expiry of
options  granted pursuant to a ECo option plan;   ii) the appropriate
dispositions of Combination Shares by all  affiliates during the period
prescribed in this paragraph  when combined with any dispositions or risk
reduction  transactions in paragraph a)(ii) above do not exceed the 
equivalent of 1,170,000 ECo Common Shares (or the  equivalent number of
shares of CCo Common Stock)  determined by reference to the Exchange Ratio
for the  exchange of ECo Common Shares for Exchangeable Shares; and   iii)
before I dispose of any Combination Shares or otherwise  reduce my risk
relative to any Combination Shares during  the period prescribed in this
paragraph, I will consult  with CCo who, in consultation with its
independent  accountants, will determine if such disposition or  risk-
reduction transaction violates the conditions for  pooling-of-interests
accounting under U.S. generally  accepted accounting principles. If the
Combination Shares  disposition or risk-reduction transaction is determined
to  violate the conditions for pooling-of-interests accounting  under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, I  agree not to make the
disposition or enter into the risk  reduction transaction.   I have been
advised that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of ECo at the time the
Arrangement is submitted for a vote of the holders of ECo Common Shares, the
Exchangeable Shares acquired by me on the Effective Date pursuant to the
Arrangement (and any shares of CCo Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor) can be sold by me only (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities
Act, or (iii) in reliance upon an exemption from registration that is
available under the Securities Act.   By its execution hereof, CCo agrees
that it will, as long as I own any Exchangeable Shares acquired by me on the
Effective Date pursuant to the Arrangement (or shares of CCo Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor), take all reasonable efforts to make timely
filings with the SEC of all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will promptly furnish
upon written request of the undersigned a written statement confirming that
such reports have been so timely filed.   CCo agrees that it shall publicly
release the combined financial results (including combined sales and net
income) of CCo and ECo for the period ending at the end of the first full
calendar   3   month of post-combination combined operations of CCo and
ECo as soon as reasonably practicable following Closing, notwithstanding that
such release may not coincide with a financial quarterly report or be in the
form of a report filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q.   Execution of this
letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an
affiliate of ECo as described above, or as a waiver of any rights I may have
to object to any claim that I am such as affiliate on or after the date of
this letter.   If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so
indicate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to the
undersigned, at which time this letter shall become a binding agreement
between us.   Very truly
yours,    By:________________________________  Name:______________________________ Address:___________________________ Date:______________________________    ACCEPTED

affiliate dispositions of all equivalent ECo Common  Shares by all affiliates
during the prescribed period do  not exceed 1,170,000 equivalent ECo Common

combination combined operations of CCo and ECo following the Effective Date
except:    2     b) during the period beginning on the Effective Date
and ending on  the Expiration Date, I may transfer, sell, put, pledge or

affiliates during the period  prescribed in this paragraph when combined with
any  dispositions or risk reduction transactions in paragraph  a)(ii) above
do not exceed the equivalent of 1,170,000 ECo  Common Shares (or the
equivalent number of shares of CCo  Common Stock) determined by reference to
the Exchange  Ratio for the exchange of ECo Common Shares for  Exchangeable
Shares; and   iii) before I dispose of any Combination Shares or shares of 
CCo Common Stock or otherwise reduce my risk relative to  any Combination
Shares or shares of CCo Common Stock  during the period prescribed in this
paragraph, I will  consult with CCo who, in consultation with its
independent  accountants, will determine if such disposition or  risk-
reduction transaction violates the conditions for  pooling-of-interests

By its execution hereof, CCo agrees that it will, as long as I own
any Combination Shares or shares of CCo Common Stock owned by me on the
Effective Date pursuant to the Arrangement, take all reasonable efforts to
make timely filings with the SEC of all reports required to be filed by it
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will
promptly furnish upon written request to the undersigned a written statement
confirming that such reports have been so timely filed.   CCo agrees that
it shall publicly release the combined financial results (including combined
sales and net income) of CCo and ECo for the period ending at the end of the
first full calendar month of post-combination combined operations of CCo and
ECo as soon as reasonably practicable following Closing, notwithstanding that
such release may not coincide with a financial quarterly report or be in the
form of a report filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q.    3     c) Execution
of this letter should not be considered an admission on  my part that I am an
affiliate of ECo as described above, or as a  waiver of any rights I may have
