(n) all other documents required to be delivered by the Cliffstar Companies
on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

(ii) a statement setting forth an estimate (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital Statement_ "), in reasonable detail (including the components of such
calculation), of the Cliffstar Companies Net Working Capital (the "

close of business (New York time) on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date; and

 

(iii) a certificate of an officer of the Company certifying that the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement
represent the Cliffstar Companies good faith estimate of such items in
accordance with this Agreement and the Financial Statement Principles.

 

(b) In the event that the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is (i) greater
than the Reference Net Working Capital minus $1,300,001.00, but (ii) less
than the



 

19  Reference Net Working Capital plus $1,300,001.00, no adjustment shall be

Purchaser at Closing, pursuant to this Section 2.06(b). In the event that the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Reference Net Working
Capital minus $1,300,000.00, then the Purchase Price payable to the Cliffstar
Companies by Purchaser at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of such
deficiency (the " _Estimated Shortfall_ "). In the event that the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Reference Net Working Capital
plus $1,300,000.00, then the Purchase Price payable to the Cliffstar
Companies by Purchaser at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such
excess (the " _Estimated Excess_ ").

 

2.07 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The Closing Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as follows:

(a) No later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the first day
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers Representative:

(i) the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet; 

(ii) a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation by Purchaser
of the Cliffstar Companies Net Working Capital (the " _Proposed Net Working
Capital_ "), as of the close of business (New York time) on the Closing Date
(the " _Net Working Capital Calculation_ ") prepared based on the
Proposed Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with this Agreement and the
Financial Statement Principles; and

(iii) a certificate of an executive officer of Purchaser certifying that the
Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation have
been prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the Financial Statement
Principles.

 

(b) Any actions taken by Purchaser at or after the Closing (including the
Financing) shall not be taken into account for the purpose of preparing the
Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation.

(c) The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital
Calculation shall be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
(at which time the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed to
constitute the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the Proposed Net Working
Capital shall be deemed to constitute the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ ")
upon the earlier of: (i) in the event that the Sellers Representative does
not deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser prior to the end of the 60-day
period beginning on the first day following the date on which the Proposed
Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital Calculation is delivered by
Purchaser to the Sellers Representative (such period being hereinafter the "
_Objection Period_ "), the first day following the expiration of such
Objection Period; and (ii) in the event that the Sellers Representative
delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within the Objection Period, the date
on which all disputes between Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
concerning the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital
Calculation as of the Closing have been resolved in writing, whether by
agreement of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative or by the Independent
Accounting Firm as provided for by Section 2.07(d) hereof.



 

20 (d) During the Objection Period, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers
Representative with access (subject to Section 5.03(c)) to all of the
documents, work papers, schedules, memoranda, books and records used by or
prepared by Purchaser or its Representatives in preparing the Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation and to finance
personnel of Purchaser and any other information which the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with the Sellers Representative in
connection therewith in all cases in a manner that does not unreasonably
disrupt the operation of the Business. The Sellers Representative and the
Cliffstar Companies shall have the right to dispute the amounts reflected on
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet or the Net Working Capital Calculation, by
delivering written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Objection Period. In the event of such a dispute, Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their
dispute, and any resolution by them as to any disputed items shall be final,
binding and conclusive on Purchaser and the Cliffstar Companies. If
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach a resolution of
their differences within 30 days following the date the Sellers
Representative delivers the Dispute Notice to Purchaser, then Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative shall submit, as soon as practicable, any
remaining disputed items to any independent accounting firm of national
reputation mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts as to which Purchaser and the
Cliffstar Companies have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
specified above. The Independent Accounting Firm may rely only upon
information submitted to it by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Purchaser and the Sellers Representative a written
decision setting forth the resolution of each disputed matter within 30 days
of submission of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital
Calculation to it and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such
submission. The decision by the Independent Accounting Firm of such disputed
matters shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser, the Sellers
Representative and the Cliffstar Companies and may be entered and enforced in
any court having jurisdiction. Purchaser, the Sellers Representative and the
Cliffstar Companies agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 2.07
for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and
the Net Working Capital Calculation shall be the sole and exclusive method
for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ , that this provision shall not
prohibit any party from instituting litigation to enforce any decision
pursuant to the terms hereof by the Independent Accounting Firm in any court
of competent jurisdiction. Any fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be divided equally and paid by Purchaser on the one hand
and the Cliffstar Companies on the other hand.

 

(e) (i) In the event that the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.07, is greater than the Reference Net
Working Capital minus $1,300,001.00, but less than the Reference Net Working
Capital plus $1,300,001.00, no adjustment shall be made to the amount of the
Closing Purchase Price paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.07(e); 
_provided_ that, in such event, (1) to the extent that the Purchase



 

21  Price was reduced by the Estimated Shortfall pursuant to Section 2.06(b)
above, Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar Companies an amount in cash equal
to the Estimated Shortfall and (2) to the extent that the Purchase Price was
increased by the Estimated Excess pursuant to Section 2.06(b) above, the
Cliffstar Companies shall pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the
Estimated Excess.

 

(ii) In the event that the Reference Net Working Capital minus $1,300,000.00
exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.07, then the Cliffstar Companies shall pay Purchaser the amount
equal to such excess minus an amount equal to the Estimated Shortfall, if any,
or plus the amount of the Estimated Excess, if any, in each case, reflected
in the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price in Section 2.06 of this
Agreement.

 

(iii) In the event that the Closing Net Working Capital reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Reference Net Working Capital plus
$1,300,000.00, then Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar Companies the amount
of such excess minus the Estimated Excess, if any, or plus the Estimated
Shortfall, if any, in each case, reflected in the calculation of the Closing
Purchase Price in Section 2.06 of this Agreement.

(iv) The amount payable by the Cliffstar Companies to Purchaser or by
Purchaser to the Cliffstar Companies as determined by the provisions of this
Section 2.07(e) shall be paid on or before July 29, 2011, in immediately
available funds by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer to an
account or accounts specified by Purchaser or the Sellers Representative, as
the case may be, _provided_ that if any portion of such payment is not paid on
or before July 29, 2011, such unpaid portion of such payment shall bear
interest from July 29, 2011 to the date that any such payment (together with
interest thereon) is made at an annual rate equal to 15%; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit any other remedies available
hereunder to the party entitled to receive such payment.

2.08 _Allocation of Purchase Price_ . The Purchase Price shall be allocated
by the Purchaser and Cliffstar Companies among the Assets as set forth on
_Annex 1_ hereto. Unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Authority or Tax
Law, the Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser will not, and will cause their
respective Affiliates not to, take a position in any forum that is
inconsistent with the details set forth in _Annex 1_ hereto, including taking
an inconsistent position on any Tax Return before any Tax Authority charged
with the collection of any Tax, or in any proceeding relating to any Tax. The
Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser will file all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax Returns in accordance with _Annex 1_ hereto.

 

2.09 _Earnout_. The Earnout Amount shall be calculated, determined and paid in
the following manner:

 

(a) Within 90 days after the end of the Earnout Period, Purchaser shall
prepare in good faith and deliver to the Sellers Representative a written
statement showing in reasonable detail the calculation of EBITDA for the
Earnout Period and the Earnout Amount payable (the " _Earnout Statement_ ").

 



 

22 (b) In the event of any objection by the Sellers Representative with respect
to the determination of the EBITDA or the Earnout Amount payable for the
Earnout Period, the Sellers Representative shall give written notice to
Purchaser of the existence of such objection and the parties will attempt to
resolve any disputed items in good faith for a period of 30 days from the
receipt of such written notice. If the Sellers Representative does not
deliver a written objection within 30 days after its receipt of an Earnout
Statement, then the calculation of the EBITDA and the Earnout Amount payable
for the Earnout Period as set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement shall
be deemed to have been accepted.

 

(c) Failing resolution pursuant to Section 2.09(b), then either Purchaser or
the Sellers Representative may submit any unresolved disputed items with
respect to the amount of EBITDA or the Earnout Amount payable for the Earnout
Period for binding resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm. Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm
to, within 30 days following such submission, resolve the unresolved
objections and such resolution shall be final and binding on all parties
hereto.

 

(d) Each of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other on the same
day), within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting
forth their respective positions on the unresolved objections. Each of
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative may (but shall not be required to)
submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other
on the same day), within 20 days after the date of the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial
memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other party.
Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no party
hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the Independent
Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing.

(e) Within 30 days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall issue a written ruling which shall include a
revised Earnout Statement as adjusted (i) pursuant to any resolutions to
objections agreed upon by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative and (ii)
pursuant to the Independent Accounting Firms resolution of the unresolved
objections. The Independent Accounting Firm shall review only those matters
specified in the unresolved objections and shall make no changes to the
Earnout Statement, except as are required to resolve the unresolved
objections. The Earnout Statement provided by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 2.09(e) shall be deemed to be the final Earnout
Statement and it shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. The
parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 2.09 for resolving
disputes with respect to the Earnout Statement shall be the sole and exclusive
method for resolving any such disputes. The Independent Accounting Firms
determination may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, but the
substance of the Independent Accounting Firms determination shall not be
subject to review in any such proceeding.

 



 

23 (f) Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Cliffstar Companies, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm.

(g) Not later than July 29, 2011, Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar
Companies (the " _Earnout Payment_ ") an amount in cash equal to the Earnout
Amount payable for the Earnout Period; _provided_ that, without limiting any
other remedies available hereunder to the Cliffstar Companies to compel
payment of the Earnout Payment, if the Earnout Payment or any portion thereof
is not received by the Cliffstar Companies on July 29, 2011, Purchaser shall
pay to the Cliffstar Companies any unpaid portion of the Earnout Payment plus
interest on such unpaid portion (the " _Earnout Interest_ ") at a rate equal
to 15% per annum, for the period beginning on July 29, 2011 and ending on the
date the remaining portion of the Earnout Payment and the Earnout Interest
are received by the Cliffstar Companies. Such cash payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
specified in accordance with written instructions provided by the Sellers
Representative to Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to the date such
payment is due or on such other date as Purchaser and Sellers Representative
shall agree. Purchaser acknowledges that the Earnout Payment and any Earnout
Interest shall be a senior unsecured obligation of Purchaser.

2.10 _Consistent Accounting_. With respect to any calculation of Net Working
Capital for the purposes of this Agreement, no change in accounting principles
or methodology shall be made from the Financial Statement Principles,
including, without limitation, with respect to the nature of accounts, level
of reserves or level of accruals. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"change in accounting principles or methodologies" includes all changes in
accounting principles, policies, practices, procedures or methodologies with
respect to financial statements, their classification or presentation, as
well as all changes in practices, methods, conventions or assumptions (unless
required by objective changes in underlying events) utilized in making
accounting estimates.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE CLIFFSTAR COMPANIES_

 

Except in each case as disclosed in the appropriate section of the separate
disclosure letter (or in any other section of the disclosure letter to the
extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any other section of the
disclosure letter is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure),
which has been delivered by the Cliffstar Companies to Purchaser prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Sellers_ __ _Disclosure Letter_ "),
each of the Cliffstar Companies, jointly and severally, makes the following
representations and warranties as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date:

3.01 _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the Cliffstar Companies_.
Each of the Cliffstar Companies is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
necessary power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its
obligations hereunder, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder,
and to own, operate or lease all the properties and assets now owned,



 

24  operated or leased by it and to carry on its respective business as it has
been and is now being conducted. Each of the Cliffstar Companies is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in: (a) each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by such Cliffstar Company
are located; and (b) where the operation of its business makes such licensing
or qualification necessary or desirable, except for those jurisdictions in
which the failure of any Cliffstar Company to be so licensed, qualified or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Cliffstar Company is in violation of any provision of its
Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other organizational document. All of
the capital stock and other equity interests in the Cliffstar Companies are
owned by the Persons identified on _Schedule 3.01_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter. There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding
regarding the transfer, sale or issuance of any equity interest or any
interest convertible into an equity interest in any Cliffstar Company to any
Person other than the Persons identified on _Schedule 3.01_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter.

3.02 _Due Authorization_. Once the Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any other documents or
instruments required to be executed and/or delivered pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement by the Cliffstar Companies, the performance by the
Cliffstar Companies of their obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the
consummation by the Cliffstar Companies of the transactions contemplated
hereby and, as applicable, thereby shall have been duly and validly authorized
by all requisite action on the part of the Cliffstar Companies. Once the
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, this Agreement shall have been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Cliffstar Companies and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser and any other parties
hereto other than the Cliffstar Companies) this Agreement and each other
document or instrument executed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
constitutes (or, in the case of any other document or instrument to be
executed after the date hereof, will constitute) a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Cliffstar Companies (to the extent that each is or will be a
party to such documents or instruments when executed), each enforceable
against the Cliffstar Companies, as applicable, in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable Law, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Once the Shareholder Approval
has been obtained, no other approval, authorization or commitment or
undertaking by any shareholder, partner, or member of any Cliffstar Company
is necessary for the transfer of the Assets contemplated hereunder and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
formation of the LLC.

conveyance of the Assets to the LLC and the Purchaser or Purchaser Sub

to the extent that any such consent, approval, authorization, filing
or notification would not, individually or in the aggregate, (A) prevent or
materially delay the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) be reasonably
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Assets, the
Business or its operations, in each case, taken as a whole. Assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and other



 

25  actions described in _Schedule 3.03_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter have
been obtained and all filings and notifications listed in _Schedule 3.03_ of
the Sellers Disclosure Letter have been made, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, each other document or instrument executed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and of the transactions contemplated

conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of any Cliffstar
Companys Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other organizational
document, as the case may be; (b) conflict with or violate any Law or
Governmental Order applicable to any Cliffstar Company or by which any of its
assets, properties or businesses is bound or affected; (c) conflict with,

applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the expiration of the applicable
waiting period thereunder, (b) for the approvals as otherwise described in
_Schedule 3.04_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, and (c) as a result of

action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Authority or other
third party, except for those Permits as to which the failure to obtain
consent would not prevent or materially delay the transactions contemplated
hereby or reasonably be expected to be material to the Assets, the Business

confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Business, except to the extent that such information (a) is generally
available to and known by the public through no fault of any Cliffstar
Company, any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives
(including the Sellers Representative); or (b) is lawfully acquired by any
Cliffstar Company, any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives
(including the Sellers Representative) from and after the Closing from
sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Cliffstar Company or any of their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives (including the Sellers
Representative) are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, the Sellers
Representative shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing and shall disclose
only that portion of such information which the Sellers Representative is
advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed,
_provided_ , that the Sellers Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

(a) From the Closing Date through the end of the three-year period beginning
on the first day following of the Closing (the " _Noncompetition Period_ "),

away, any Person who placed an order with the Cliffstar Companies within the
twelve-month period immediately prior to the Closing Date; (B) (1) solicit,
recruit or hire any employees of the Cliffstar Companies or Persons who work

Competitive Business; and/or (2) encourage any employee of the Cliffstar
Companies to leave the employment of the same in order to engage in a
Competitive Business; or (C) assist any Person or entity in any way to do, or
attempt to do, anything prohibited by this Section 5.04(a) (except for

Companies from (i) owning not more than 5% of the equity interests of any
Person that is engaged in any Competitive Business, and (ii) acquiring
(whether by means of acquisition, asset purchase, merger, consolidation,
similar business combination or otherwise) a Person engaged in a
Competitive Business together with other lines of business if the percentage
of such Competitive Business represents no more than 10% of the acquired
Persons assets (measured by the most current financial statements published
by the acquired Person in the ordinary course of business) and does not
relate to the Competitive Business.

(c) During the Noncompetition Period, no Cliffstar Company shall, or permit
any of its Affiliates or Representatives (including the Sellers

Noncompetition Period, or encourage any such employee to leave such employment
or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such
employees; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 5.04(c) shall prevent any
Cliffstar Company or any of their Affiliates from (i) publishing general
recruitment/help wanted advertisements or making other general postings via
other media of employment opportunities or listings, so long as such
advertisement, posting or listing is not specifically targeted to Business
Employees or (ii) hiring (x) any Business Employee whose employment has been
terminated by Purchaser, Purchaser Sub, or any of their respective



 

50  Affiliates or (y) after 180 days from the date of termination of employment,
any Business Employee whose employment has been terminated by such Business

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including the obtaining of all necessary actions, waivers, consents and

the case of the HSR Act later than 10 Business Days after the date hereof,
make all required filings in connection with the transaction contemplated
hereby under (i) the HSR Act and (ii) any other applicable Laws, and

any other similar applicable Laws and to obtain early termination of any

(c) The Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions

promptly inform each other of the substance of notices or other communications
between the Cliffstar Companies or Purchaser and their Representatives and
counsel, as the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, and any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such
transactions. Each of the Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the waiting periods under applicable Law with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
The Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall keep each other timely apprised
of any inquiries or requests for additional information from any Governmental
Authority pursuant to any applicable Law, and shall comply promptly with any

Law, the Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Cliffstar Companies
and Purchaser agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without

and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, giving the
other partys outside counsel the opportunity to attend and participate.



 

51 (d) Each of Purchaser, Purchaser Sub and the Cliffstar Companies shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. In that regard, each will comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "),

_Antitrust Division_ ") or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings or such transactions and cooperate with each other in connection with
any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith). 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, however,
neither Purchaser or Purchaser Sub nor any Cliffstar Company shall be
required, in connection with the matters covered by this Section 5.05, to (i)
contest, resist or challenge any legal proceeding instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by any Governmental Authority challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as a violation of any Antitrust Law or

other similar temporary order that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned, (ii) pay any amounts

fees) to obtain any consent or approval (other than costs and fees associated
with responding to requests for additional information) or to settle any claim
that may be contested, (iii) appeal any decision or Action of any court, (iv)
hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their or

respective businesses, or (vi) waive any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02 of this Agreement.

 

(f) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as
required by this Agreement, Purchaser, its subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of the Cliffstar
Companies, acquire (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase
or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any material amounts of assets of or
any equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, unless
that acquisition or agreement (i) would not reasonably be expected to
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, or materially delay, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period
under any applicable Law; or (ii) would reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



 

52 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any party may, as
it deems advisable and necessary, based on the advice of outside counsel,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other parties under this Section 5.05(g) as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of such
materials.

5.06 _Further Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, each as may be required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

5.07 _Legal Privileges_. The Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that all attorney-client, work product and other legal privileges that
may exist with respect to a Cliffstar Company, the Business or the Assets
shall, from and after the Closing Date, be deemed joint privileges of the
Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser. Both the Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to
preserve all privileges and neither the Cliffstar Companies nor Purchaser
shall knowingly waive any such privilege without the prior written consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

5.08 _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

 

(a) The Cliffstar Companies and the Sellers Representative shall not, and
shall not authorize or permit any of their Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives (including the Sellers Representative) to, directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a
possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal.
Sellers Representative shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
and shall cause the Cliffstar Companies and their Affiliates and all of its
and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes
hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) relating to the
direct or indirect disposition, whether by asset or stock sale, merger or
otherwise, of all or any portion of the Business or the Assets.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this Section 5.08, Sellers
Representative shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days
after receipt thereof by Sellers Representative) advise Purchaser orally and
in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which
could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

 



 

53 (c) Each Cliffstar Company agrees that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this Section 5.08 shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Purchaser and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Purchaser.

5.09 _Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, each of Purchaser and Sellers
Representative shall promptly notify the other party in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has resulted
in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any representation or
warranty made by any Cliffstar Company or Purchaser or Purchaser Sub, as
applicable, hereunder not being true and correct if such inaccuracy would
cause the conditions set forth in either Section 6.01(a) or 6.02(a) to not be
satisfied, or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, the failure of any of the conditions or covenants set forth in this
Agreement to be complied with or otherwise satisfied;

 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of the Cliffstar Companies,
threatened against, relating to, or involving or otherwise affecting the
Business, the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed in the
Sellers Disclosure Letter or that relates to the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The receipt of information by Purchaser or Sellers Representative
pursuant to this Section 5.09 shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by any
Cliffstar Company or Purchaser or Purchaser Sub, as applicable, in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Sellers
Disclosure Letter or the Purchasers Disclosure Letter, as applicable.



 

54 5.10 _Purchaser Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to (i) arrange and obtain debt and equity financing (" _Financing_
") as promptly as reasonably necessary for the proceeds thereof to be
available on the Closing Date in the amounts set forth on  _Schedule 5.10_ of
the Purchasers Disclosure Letter on terms that are not (other than
undertaking litigation or incurring financing fees and costs materially in
excess of those implicit in on _Schedule 5.10_ of the Purchasers Disclosure
Letter) less favorable to Purchaser than the terms set forth in _Schedule
5.10_ of the Purchasers Disclosure Letter (any financing described in this
sentence, " _Acceptable Financing_ ") or, if such financing is not available
or Purchaser after compliance with this Section 5.10, in such amounts and on
such other commercially reasonable terms and conditions as are reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser in its sole discretion, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates in the
definitive agreements for such Financing and (iii) consummate the Financing at
or prior to Closing, in either case, subject to Article 8. Purchaser shall
provide to the Cliffstar Companies copies of all agreements, other than fee
agreements related to the Financing and shall keep the Cliffstar Companies
reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the financing
process relating thereto;  _provided_ , that Purchaser will provide any
reasonably requested fee information in respect of equity financing to the
Cliffstar Companies. In furtherance of the foregoing covenant, subject to
Article 8, if Acceptable Financing is available to Purchaser, Purchaser
hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to such Acceptable Financing, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to such Acceptable
Financing in such definitive agreements, and (iii) use reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Acceptable Financing at or prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Cliffstar Companies shall, at Purchasers
sole expense, provide to Purchaser their cooperation reasonably requested by
Purchaser that is necessary in connection with the Financing and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) using commercially
reasonable efforts to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies, and to provide such materials for inclusion in presentations
therewith, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing; provided that the
Cliffstar Companies shall only be required to assist in preparation of
materials to the extent relating to the Cliffstar Companies or their
subsidiaries on a standalone basis without giving effect to the purchase of
Assets or Purchasers post-Closing plans or projections, (iii) subject to
execution of a non-disclosure agreement a form reasonably acceptable to the
Cliffstar Companies, using commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions
necessary to permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing
to evaluate the Cliffstar Companies current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes
of establishing collateral arrangements, (iv) assisting Purchaser in the
preparation or inclusion (in either a registration statement or a private
placement memorandum for an offering of notes under the Securities Act or any
other offering document used by Purchaser in connection with efforts to raise
financing for the transaction contemplated hereby)



 

55  of all financial statements and financial and other information regarding
the Cliffstar Companies that would be required in a Registration Statement for
use in either the Registration Statement or the Private Placement Memorandum
under the rules and regulations under the Securities Act in connection with
the Financing (the " _Registration Statement_ "), including (a) financial
statements of the Cliffstar Companies for the fiscal years ending on December
29, 2007, January 3, 2009 and January 2, 2009 (and any more recent completed
annual period) and any interim period financial statements of the Cliffstar
Companies that would be required by the United States Securities Exchange
Commission (" _SEC_ "), and (b) assisting in the preparation of any pro forma
financial statements that would be required by the SEC in the registration
statement on Form S-3, in each case compliant with the rules and regulations
applicable to such financial statements, including, without limitation,
Regulation S-X, (v) assisting Purchaser in requesting accountants comfort
letters and consents and other customary documentation required by, or in
connection with, the Registration Statement, and (vi) requesting that the
Cliffstar Companies independent auditors provide customary comfort letters to
any underwriters or initial purchasers consistent with SAS 72 (as amended),
including standard negative assurance on any interim period and pro forma
financial statements; _provided_ , in each case set forth above, that such
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
the Cliffstar Companies and their subsidiaries. Upon the Closing or any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, Purchaser and
Purchaser Sub shall promptly reimburse the Cliffstar Companies for any
expenses and costs paid to third parties and incurred in connection with the
Cliffstar Companies or their respective Affiliates obligations under this
Section 5.10(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Cliffstar Companies nor any of their subsidiaries (other than the
Cliffstar Companies and their subsidiaries following the Closing Date) shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any replacements
thereof). Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Cliffstar Companies
and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, Representatives and
advisors from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith.

5.11 _Nonassignable Contracts and Permits_.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign to
the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub any Contract or Permit which is by Law or
its terms nonassignable or the assignment of which would constitute a
violation of Law or such Contract.

 

(b) The parties hereto will cooperate to attempt to obtain all required
consents to the assignment of the Material Contracts prior to Closing which
are not to be discharged at the Closing and which require consents to
assignment, and any payments required to be made to the other party to the
Contract in connection with obtaining such consent shall be borne by
Purchaser. 

(c) If, as of the Closing, an attempted assignment of any Contract related to
the Business would be ineffective or would affect any Cliffstar Companys
rights thereunder so that the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub would not in
fact receive all such rights (such Contract, a " _Non-Assignable Contract_ "),
the Cliffstar Companies shall cooperate with the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser
Sub in a mutually acceptable arrangement to provide for the LLC,



 

56  Purchaser or Purchaser Sub the benefit (including the economic benefit) of
such Non-Assignable Contract (other than legal title). Purchaser shall bear
all administrative costs in connection with any such arrangement. If and so
long after the Closing as such assignment shall not have been made, the
Cliffstar Companies shall (i) act as Purchasers and Purchaser Subs agent to
the extent that such action shall not result in violation of such Non-
Assignable Contract, transfer to the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub all
assets and rights, including all monies, received in respect of such Non-
Assignable Contract and hold such Non-Assignable Contract in trust for the
LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub and (ii) to the extent that the provisions of
clause (i) above are not sufficient to transfer all of the benefits (including
the economic benefit) of such Non-Assignable Contract (other than legal
title), or any of such Non-Assignable Contract has been cancelled as a result
of the attempted assignment, take such actions (which, without limitation, may
include entering into subcontracting arrangements with the LLC, Purchaser or
Purchaser Sub) as are commercially reasonable to provide all of the benefits
(or the equivalent thereof, including the economic benefit) of such Non-
Assignable Contract (other than legal title) to the LLC, Purchaser or
Purchaser Sub. Purchaser and Purchaser Sub shall be responsible for the
Liabilities or obligations arising out of any nonassignable Contract. With
respect to any transfer, subcontract or assignment of the Non-Assignable
Contracts made to the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub by the Cliffstar
Companies hereunder, Purchaser hereby agrees to assume, perform, discharge
when due, and indemnify the Cliffstar Companies from and against, all
obligations and liabilities of the Cliffstar Companies with respect to the
applicable underlying Non-Assignable Contract and none of the Cliffstar
Companies or their Affiliates shall have any Liability in connection with such
transfer, subcontract or assignment or the underlying Non-Assignable Contract.

 

(d) Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, each at
their own expense, to transfer all Permits held by the Cliffstar Companies
from Cliffstar Companies to the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub or, where
Cliffstar Companies Permits are not transferable, to facilitate the LLC,
Purchaser or Purchaser Sub in obtaining its own Permits. To that end,
each party shall take whatever actions are required of said party, in a
timely manner as governed by applicable Law, to apply for the transfer or re-
issuance of any Permits to the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub. To the extent
that any Permits cannot be transferred or reissued to the LLC, Purchaser or
Purchaser Sub as of the Closing, Cliffstar Companies, to the extent allowable
by Law, shall authorize the LLC, Purchaser or Purchaser Sub to continue to
operate pursuant to Cliffstar Companies Permits until such time as the LLC,
Purchaser or Purchaser Sub is able to obtain its own Permits and Purchaser
shall indemnify Cliffstar Companies for all costs, liabilities, obligations,
damages and expenses associated with the LLC, Purchasers or Purchaser Subs
operation under Cliffstar Companies Permits after the Closing Date.

(e) To the extent that any of the rights, assets and properties contemplated
by Section 5.20(a) cannot be contributed to the LLC, or such contribution
would be ineffective, prior to the Closing (the " _Non-Transferable Assets_
"), the Cliffstar Companies shall cooperate with Purchaser in a mutually
acceptable arrangement to provide for Purchaser the benefit (including the
economic benefit) of such Non-Transferable Assets. Purchaser shall bear all
administrative costs in connection with any such arrangement. If, and so long
after the Closing as, such contribution shall not have been made, the
Cliffstar Companies shall (i) to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
transfer to Purchaser all Assets and rights, including all monies, received
in respect of such Non-Transferable Asset and hold such Non-Transferable



 

57  Asset in trust for Purchaser and (ii) to the extent that the effects of
clause (i) above do not cause the transfer of all of the benefits (including
the economic benefit) of such Non-Transferable Asset, or any of such Non-
Transferable Asset has been cancelled as a result of the attempted assignment,
take such actions (which, without limitation, may include entering into
subcontracting arrangements with Purchaser) as are commercially reasonable to
provide all of the benefits (or the equivalent thereof, including the economic
benefit) of such Non-Transferable Asset to Purchaser. With respect to any
transfer, subcontract or assignment of the Non-Transferable Assets made to
Purchaser by the Cliffstar Companies hereunder, Purchaser hereby agrees to
assume, perform, discharge when due and indemnify the Cliffstar Companies from
and against, all obligations and Liabilities of the Cliffstar Companies with
respect to the applicable underlying Non-Transferable Asset and release the
Cliffstar Companies and their Affiliates from any and all Liabilities in
connection with such transfer, subcontract or assignment or the underlying
Non-Transferable Asset.

 

5.12 _Post-Closing Covenants of Purchaser and Purchaser Sub_.

 

(a) Except (x) as set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter and (y) as Purchaser and the Sellers Representative may otherwise
agree in writing, from the Closing Date through and including the Earnout
Expiration Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause Purchaser Sub to, operate
the Business in the ordinary course consistent with the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall operate the Business
in good faith and not take, or fail to take, such actions with the intention
of avoiding or impeding the Cliffstar Companies ability to achieve
the maximum Earnout Amount which would result in the payment by Purchaser to
the Cliffstar Companies of $55,000,000 by virtue of Purchaser Sub having
achieved EBITDA during the Earnout Period of at least $92,000,000 (" _Maximum
Earnout Target_ ") in accordance the earnout period business plan set forth
on _Schedule 5.12_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (the " _Earnout Business
Plan_ "). During the Earnout Period, except as Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative may otherwise agree in writing, from the Closing Date through
and including the last day of the Earnout Period, Purchaser and its
subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause Purchaser Sub not to, and Purchaser
Sub shall not: 

(i) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of any material
assets or properties of Purchaser Sub except for sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and for
distributions of cash to Purchaser, subject to Section 5.12(b)(v);

 

(ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of Purchaser
Sub or the direct or indirect equity interests of Purchaser Sub, including by

a sale of control of Purchaser shall not violate this clause;

(iii) except as required by Law or third-party providers of benefit programs
modifying such programs uniformly in respect of all similarly situated
program participants, establish any new compensation or other benefit
arrangement or make any material change to any of the benefit plans 



 

58  required to be maintained by Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.17 below that
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of impairing in any material
respect Purchaser Subs employees motivation to apply their best efforts to
achieve the full Maximum Earnout Target or breach this Section 5.12;

 

(iv) except as required by Law, reorganize, combine, integrate, consolidate or
otherwise take steps to transfer any portion of Purchaser Subs business to
an entity other than Purchaser Sub or its subsidiaries or to expand, alter or
change the type or nature of Purchaser Subs business from the business
conducted by the Cliffstar Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(v) reorganize, combine, integrate, consolidate or otherwise take steps
to transfer any portion of Purchasers business to Purchaser Sub or its
subsidiaries;

(vi) unreasonably require Purchaser Sub to cut staff, capital expenditures
and operating expenses or take other actions that are not commercially
reasonable (if the same would be inconsistent with the Cliffstar Companies
practices prior to the Effective Time); 

(vii) without the prior approval of the Earnout Key Employees, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, materially
change, modify or alter Purchaser Subs pricing (except in accordance with
Sections 5.12(b)(vi) and 5.12(b)(vii) below), marketing, sales, practices or
operations in such a manner as would reasonably be expected to hinder or
impair in any material respect its achievement of the Maximum Earnout Target;

 

(viii) directly or indirectly compete with Purchaser Sub whether as owner,
partner, shareholder, co-venturer or otherwise, engage, participate or invest
in any Person that (A) develops, manufactures, markets or distributes products
or services that are similar to the Companys products or services or (B)
otherwise competes with the Companys business as currently conducted or
proposed to be conducted; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing
shall not prohibit any investment in publicly traded stock of a company
representing less than 2% of the capital stock of such company and (y) the
foregoing shall not prohibit Purchaser from continuing to operate its current
business, including all currently existing product lines, as conducted
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
servicing of existing customers and the development and release of new
products for those customers;

 

(ix) allocate to Purchaser Sub corporate overhead charges relating to the
operation of the Business in excess of the adjusted overhead costs of the
Business as of the date hereof, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter or as may be required by Law; and

 



 

59 (x) except with the consent of the Sellers Representative, terminate or
demote other than for Cause any of the employees set forth on _Schedule 5.12_
of Sellers Disclosure Letter (each an " _Earnout Key Employee_ "); _provided_
that " _Cause_ " for this purpose shall mean when used in connection with the
termination of a Earnout Key Employee, the termination of the Earnout Key
Employee by or at the direction of Purchaser Sub on account of (i) the willful
and continued failure by the Earnout Key Employee to substantially perform
his duties (other than any such failure resulting from the Earnout Key
Employees incapacity due to physical or mental illness) that has not been
cured within 30 days after a written demand for substantial performance
is delivered to the Earnout Key Employee by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors of Purchaser Sub, which demand reasonably identifies the manner
in which the Board of Directors believes that the Earnout Key Employee has not
substantially performed Earnout Key Employees duties, or (ii) the willful
engaging by the Earnout Key Employee in conduct which is demonstrably and
materially injurious to Purchaser, Purchaser Sub or their respective
Affiliates, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of determining "Cause," no
act, or failure to act, on the Earnout Key Employees part shall be deemed
"willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Earnout Key Employee with
knowledge or reason to believe that the Earnout Key Employees act, or
failure to act, was not in the best interest of Purchaser or Purchaser Sub;

 

(b) In addition, during the Earnout Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
Purchaser Sub to:

 

(i) maintain Purchaser Sub as a separate legal entity of Purchaser or its
subsidiary and conduct the Business exclusively through Purchaser Sub;

(iii) maintain Purchaser Subs principal place of business in the current
location of the Company in Dunkirk, New York;

(iv) require any successor of Purchaser (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, sale of stock or assets, consolidation or otherwise) to
assume and agree, in writing, to perform this Agreement, in the same manner
and to the same extent that Purchaser and Purchaser Sub would have been
required to perform if no such succession had taken place; 

(v) make available to Purchaser Sub funding and other resources (including
personnel) at times and in the amounts set forth in the business plan for the
fiscal year ending January 1, 2011 set forth in the Earnout Business Plan;



 

60 (vi) provide the Earnout Key Employees with general management authority for
the operation of Purchaser Sub and primary responsibility for day-to-day
operations of Purchaser Sub, including authority to implement the equipment
and plant upgrades described on _Schedule 1.01(i)_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter and the authority to enter into contracts and agreements, and
modifications thereto, with suppliers, distributors, customers and vendors in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices; _provided_
that any changes to pricing of more than 5% or other material changes to
contracts and agreements or entry into any contract or agreement of a term of
six months or longer, or that would require performance continuing after that
date, or any substantial short-term increase or decrease in price, shall
require approval pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(vii)(which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and

 

(vii) to facilitate the approval process, and to implement long term
arrangements, a committee consisting of Paul Harder, Bill Reis, Chris Cronje
and Mike Gibbons shall work together to review and negotiate any new contracts
(including to develop new grower contracts) entered into with a term extending
past January 1, 2011 and to review and approve any other matters otherwise
requiring Purchasers approval under Section 5.12(b)(vi). In this regard, Paul
Harder and Chris Cronje shall provide Bill Reis and Mike Gibbons promptly, in
advance, a proposed list of new contracts, contract expirations and renewals
of contracts or amendments thereof with summaries thereof (including the
nature of purchase and costs), which Bill Reis and Mike Gibbons shall review
and determine if more information should be provided or if Purchaser should
be involved in negotiations, and Bill Reis and Mike Gibbons shall review
various areas for possible synergies/cost savings and shall decide, jointly
with Paul Harder and Chris Cronje, on appropriate actions regarding such
potential synergies/cost savings, which shall be communicated to the
management team. For the avoidance of doubt, each of Paul Harder and Chris
Cronje shall communicate with (x) Bill Reis on all procurement issues and (y)
Mike Gibbons on all customer pricing issues.

(c) Notwithstanding the contingent nature of the Earnout Amounts, however,
except as set forth in Sections 5.12(a) and 5.12(b) above, the Business shall
be operated consistently with and in compliance with all of Purchasers
applicable policies and procedures, including, without limitation, Purchasers
policies and procedures relating to pricing, procurement, accounting
(including the recognition of revenue and the management of accounts
receivable and payable), which are set forth on _Schedule 5.12(c)_.of the
Purchaser Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) During the Earnout Period, Purchaser and Purchaser Sub shall provide to
the Sellers Representative monthly statements providing in reasonable detail

other information reasonably necessary to permit the Sellers Representative
to assess progress toward the achievement of the



 

61  Maximum Earnout Target. Each such statement will be prepared in accordance
with the accounting policies, principles, procedures and adjustments set forth
on _Schedule 1.01(iv)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter. Purchaser and
Purchaser Sub shall maintain such accounting records, ledgers, books and other
documents as may be necessary to prepare such statements and make such
records, ledgers, books and other documents available to the Sellers
Representative upon his request after reasonable notice and during normal
business hours. Any material changes to the earnout period business plan or to
pricing, procurement, the management of customer relations, the modification
of arrangements with customers, the incurrence of indebtedness, the making of
capital expenditures, the recognition of revenue, and the management of
accounts receivable and payable proposed by Earnout Key Employees which
represent a deviation from the past practice of the Cliffside Companies shall
require the approval of the appropriate Purchaser personnel. If the Sellers
Representative disagrees with the calculations in a monthly report from
Purchaser or believes that there has been a material breach of any covenant
set forth in this Section 5.12, then the dispute shall be subject to a binding
arbitration proceeding conducted before a panel of three arbitrators
experienced in financial matters or business practices mutually acceptable to
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative in New York, New York under the
Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the JAMS in effect at the time
an alleged earnout covenant breach is claimed and demand for arbitration is
made. The costs of arbitration, including arbitrators fees, and related
administrative fees, shall be borne equally by the parties to such
arbitration; _provided_ that each party shall bear the costs and fees of its
own counsel.

5.13 _Guarantee_. Purchaser hereby guarantees, as a primary obligor and not
merely as a surety, the payment and performance of all obligations and other
Liabilities of each of Purchaser Sub and, following the Closing, the LLC,

equitable discharge of, or any defense, setoff or counterclaim available to, a
guarantor. Purchaser agrees to take all actions to cause Purchaser Sub to pay
and perform its obligations and other Liabilities under this Agreement.

had the stock of the Cliffstar Companies been acquired in lieu of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one half by
Purchaser and one half by the Cliffstar Companies, and Purchaser shall be
responsible for payment of all additional Transfer Taxes in excess of those

that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and
caused to be filed when due by Purchaser. The

 



 

62  Cliffstar Companies shall cooperate in the preparation, execution, and
filing of all Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes which become payable in

that any of the Cliffstar Companies owns any Assets, or that any Assets have
not been transferred by the Cliffstar Companies to either Purchaser Sub or the
LLC, as applicable, then the applicable Cliffstar Company shall transfer,
assign and convey, or shall cause any such Asset to be transferred, assigned
and conveyed, to Purchaser Sub or the LLC, as applicable, without any

immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, with respect to each
Business Employee who is, as of the Closing Date, on disability or any other
approved leave of absence, any transfer, if applicable, shall be effective as
of the date that such Business Employee returns to work. The parties each

Business Employees are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any Business
Employee or former employee of any Cliffstar Company, any participant in any
Employee Plans or any beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment
with the LLC, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.

5.18 _Shareholder Approval_. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement,
each of the Cliffstar Companies shall use its reasonable best efforts to

approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

detail the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto as soon as practicable
following discovery of such claim and prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period. 

(c) The Cliffstar Companies shall take and shall cause their Affiliates to
take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate (consistent with
applicable Law) any Loss upon becoming aware of the event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which
gives rise to the Loss.

7.04 _Procedures for Indemnification Other Than Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party
(hereinafter an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall claim to have suffered a Loss
(other than with respect to any claim asserted, demand or other Action by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement (hereinafter a " _Third-Party
Claim_ ")) for which indemnification is available under Section 7.02 or 7.03,
as the case may be (for purposes of this Section 7.04, regardless of whether
such Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a payment in respect of such
claim by virtue of the provisions of Section 7.05 hereof), the Indemnified
Party shall notify the party required to provide indemnification (hereinafter
an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such claim, which written notice
shall describe the facts and circumstances giving rise to such Loss, the
basis upon which indemnity is being sought, the amount or estimated amount of
the Loss, if known or reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made
(or if not then reasonably ascertainable, the maximum amount of such
claim reasonably estimated by the Indemnified Party), and the method of
computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss
shall have occurred. 

(b) If the Indemnified Party shall have received from the Indemnifying Party
within 30 days a written notice setting forth the Indemnifying Partys
objections to such claim and the Indemnifying Partys reasons for such
objection, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of 10
Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party receives such objection
(such period is hereinafter referred to as the " _Negotiation Period_ ").
After the Negotiation Period, if the parties still cannot agree on the claim,
the Indemnified Party may, at any time thereafter, until the expiration
of the applicable statue of limitations with respect to its claim for
indemnification, commence legal proceedings against the Indemnifying Party to
enforce its rights to indemnification from and against any Losses described in
the written notice described in Section 7.04(a) above.

(c) In the event that the Indemnified Party commences an Action in order to
recover Losses hereunder, upon final determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction



 

71  with respect thereto, the non-prevailing party in such Action shall
reimburse the prevailing partys reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such Action.

7.05 _Additional Limits on Rights to Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the Cliffstar Companies be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.02(a)(i) or Section 7.02(a)(ii):

(i) unless and until any Losses as to which Purchaser Indemnified Parties
otherwise may be entitled to indemnification hereunder (without giving effect
to this clause (i)) exceed $5,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), _provided_
that, after the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses exceeds the
Basket Amount, Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall, in the aggregate, be
entitled to indemnification only to the extent the aggregate amount of all
such Losses exceeds the Basket Amount; and

 

(ii) for any Losses to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds $50,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
limitations set forth in Sections 7.05(a)(i) and (ii) shall not apply to
Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting from fraud or Willful Breach
by a party, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, or to claims involving breaches of any of the
representations of the Cliffstar Companies set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02,
3.19, 3.25(c), 3.31(b) and 3.31(c).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Purchaser or Purchaser Sub be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.03(a)(i):

(i) unless and until any Losses as to which the Seller Indemnified Parties
otherwise may be entitled to indemnification hereunder (without giving effect
to this clause (i)) exceed the Basket Amount, _provided_ that after the
aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall, in the aggregate, be entitled to
indemnification only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses
exceeds the Basket Amount; _provided_ , further, that the limitations set
forth in this Section 7.05(c)(i) shall not apply to Losses arising out of,
relating to or resulting from fraud; and

 

(ii) for any Losses to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds the Cap; and

 

(iii) the limitations set forth in Sections 7.05(a)(i) and (ii) shall not
apply to Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting from fraud



 

72  or Willful Breach by a party, as determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or to claims involving breaches
of any of the representations of the Purchaser set forth in Sections 4.01 and
4.02.

(d) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to double recovery for
any Losses. In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder,
the amount of any indemnified Loss shall be determined without duplication of
any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any
other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Without limitation of
the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification
for Losses (and the amount of any such Losses shall not be includable in
determining whether the aggregate amount of the Losses exceeds the Basket
Amount) if and to the extent that the amount of any Losses from any matter has
been taken into account in the determination of the Closing Net Working
Capital.

 

(e) Any payment made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party shall be
net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party for such
claim. Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
insurance proceeds to which it or any of its Affiliates is entitled with
respect to any indemnity claim hereunder.

 

(f) Indemnification payments under this Agreement shall not, at the time of
payment, be reduced by any anticipated income Tax benefits that may accrue to
the Indemnified Party by reason of the Loss or other event that is the subject
of the indemnification and shall not be increased by any anticipated income
Tax costs that the Indemnified Party may incur by reason of
the indemnification payments. Nonetheless, in the event that an Indemnified
Party does ultimately realize a net income Tax benefit as a result of such a
Loss or other event that exceeds the income Tax cost incurred as a result of
such indemnification payment, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the
Indemnifying Party such portion of the previously received indemnification
payment as will offset the amount of such excess, after taking into account
the income Tax effect of such repayment. Similarly, in the event, and to the
extent, that an Indemnified Party ultimately incurs a net income Tax cost from
an indemnification payment that offsets the net income Tax benefit from the
corresponding Loss or other event, the Indemnified Party shall reduce the
amount of any Tax benefit repayment required pursuant to this Section 7.05(f)
by a corresponding amount, but in no case shall such reduction exceed the
amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party.
Any amounts payable pursuant to the preceding two sentences shall be paid
promptly to the Indemnifying Party at the time of filing of the relevant Tax
Return. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no payment shall be
required under this Section 7.05(f) other than with respect to a Tax benefit
actually claimed by the Indemnified Party, and any such payment shall be
refunded, with interest at the federal income tax underpayment rate, in the
event that any such claimed Tax benefit is ultimately disallowed.

(g) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to set off any Loss against (i) any
other payment due under this Agreement (including any annual installment
payment), including the Earnout Amount, any interest thereon, or any
adjustments to the Purchase Price hereunder or (ii) any consulting payments
due under the Consulting Agreement, although such losses may be included in
the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital.



 

73 (h) For purposes of calculating Losses under this Article 7 (but not for
determining the existence of a breach of a representation or warranty), the
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been made without any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier.

 

7.06 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article 7
in respect of any Third-Party Claim shall give the Indemnifying Party from
whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought: (i) prompt written
notice (but in no event more than 10 days after the Indemnified Party acquires
knowledge thereof) of such Third-Party Claim; and (ii) copies of all
documents and information relating to any such Third-Party Claim within 10
days of their being obtained by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that, the
failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify or provide copies to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
to the Indemnified Party for any liability hereunder except to the extent that
such failure shall have prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser time as may be
necessary to comply with statutory response requirements for litigation
claims that are included in any Third-Party Claim) from receipt of the notice
contemplated in Section 7.06(a) to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not
the Indemnifying Party will, at its sole cost and expense, defend
the Indemnified Party against such claim. If the Indemnifying Party timely
gives notice that it intends to defend the Third-Party Claim, it shall have
the right, except as hereafter provided, but not the obligation, to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the Third-Party Claim and
to be represented by counsel of its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will
not admit any liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or
discharge the same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that, the
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any proceeding with
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choice and at the Indemnified Partys
expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party may not enter
into a settlement of any such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall be not unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless such settlement requires no more than a monetary payment for
which the Indemnified Party is indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or
involves other matters not binding upon the Indemnified Party; and provided,
further, that, in the event the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing
to accept the defense of such Third-Party Claim as provided above in this
Section 7.06(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the Third-Party Claim in
such manner as the Indemnified Party deems appropriate, in its sole
discretion, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
therefor from the Indemnifying Party to the extent provided under this
Article 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a conflict of interest
in the defense of such action between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its
own counsel and the defense or settlement of any such claim or demand and its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be
included as part of the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnified Party elects to exercise such right, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense or settlement of such
claim at its sole cost and expense. In

 



 

74  any event, no Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party
claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the consent of
the Indemnifying party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7.07 _Effect of Indemnification_. Any indemnity payment made hereunder shall
be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

ARTICLE 8

 

 _TERMINATION AND WAIVER_

 

8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ "):

(a) by Purchaser, effective upon written notice to the Sellers
Representative, if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Cliffstar Companies which has rendered the
satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 6.02
permanently incapable of fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been
waived by Purchaser, and the breach has not been cured within 30 days
following Purchasers written notice of such breach; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(a) shall not be available
to Purchaser if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

 

(b) by the Sellers Representative, effective upon written notice to
Purchaser, if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Purchaser which has rendered the satisfaction of any
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 permanently incapable of fulfillment,
such violation or breach has not been waived by the Sellers Representative,
and the breach has not been cured within 30 days following the Cliffstar
Companies written notice of such breach; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be available to
the Cliffstar Companies if they are then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

 

(c) by the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, effective upon written
notice, if the Closing shall not have occurred within 120 days from the date
hereof (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if on the End Date
the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.01(c) (Regulatory Approvals)
or 6.02(c) (Regulatory Approvals) shall not have been satisfied but all other
conditions to Closing shall be satisfied or shall be capable of being
satisfied upon satisfaction of the condition to Closing set forth in such
sections, then either party shall have the right to extend the End Date
an additional 90 days by notifying the other party in writing of such
election prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(c) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
(including the obligation to consummate the Closing, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions precedent to Closing,
pursuant to Article 2 hereof) shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;



 

75 (d) by Purchaser or the Sellers Representative, effective upon written
notice, if there shall be in effect a final, non-appealable order of a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that the right to terminate the Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall
not be available to a party who shall not have complied with its obligation
under this Agreement;

 

(e) by the Sellers Representative, effective upon written notice, if
Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing within three Business Days of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section
6.02 (other than those that are satisfied by action taken at the Closing;
_provided_ , that such conditions are capable of being satisfied); 

(f) by Purchaser for any reason or no reason effective upon written notice at
any time after 60 days following the date hereof and on or before the first
to occur of the day immediately preceding the End Date (as the same may be
extended pursuant to Section 8.01(c) above) and the second Business Day after
receipt by Purchaser of any notice given by Sellers Representative pursuant
to Section 8.01(e); or

(g) by the mutual written consent of the Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser.

8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto arising under or
out of this Agreement except that the provisions of Section 5.03
(Confidentiality), the second and third sentences of Section 5.10(b)
(reimbursement and indemnification relating to the Cliffstar Companies
cooperation in Purchasers financing), the third and fifth sentences of
Section 5.20(a), the last sentence of Section 5.20(b), this Article
8 (Termination and Waiver), and Article 10 (General Provisions) shall survive
the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
relieve either party from liability for damages of the other party resulting
from the intentional misrepresentation or Willful Breach by a party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 

8.03 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (1) by the Sellers Representative
pursuant to Section 8.01(c) (other than a termination by the Sellers
Representative due to a failure of the conditions precedent set forth in
Sections 6.01(b) or 6.01(c)) or 8.01(e) or (2) by Purchaser pursuant to
8.01(c) and at the time of such termination all of the conditions to
Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been satisfied (other than the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02(e) and other than any such conditions that (A) have not
been satisfied as a result of Purchaser or Purchaser Subs breach or failure
to perform under this Agreement or (B) by their terms may only be satisfied at
Closing (provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied)), then
in such event Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar Companies the Purchaser
Termination Fee as hereinafter defined) in cash, such payment to be made in
the case of clause (1) above within two Business Days after such 



 

76  termination or in the case of clause (2) above immediately prior to and as a
condition to such termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 8.01(f), such payment shall be made immediately prior to
and as a condition to such termination.

(b) " _Purchaser Termination Fee_ " means (i) $35,000,000, in circumstances
in which a Purchaser Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.03(a)
and either (x) the Acceptable Financing is available in an amount equal to the
Purchase Price, (y) Purchaser or Purchaser Sub has committed a Willful Breach
that was the primary cause of or primarily resulted in the facts giving rise
to the termination or (z) Purchaser shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f); or (ii) $15,000,000, in any other circumstances
in which a Purchaser Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.03(a).

 

(c) " _Willful Breach_ ", shall mean a material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act or failure to act by Purchaser or Purchaser Sub or the
Cliffstar Companies, as the case may be, where such party had actual knowledge
or reasonably should have known that the taking of such action or failure to
take such action would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, a
breach of this Agreement.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Purchaser Termination Fee is payable
and there is any dispute between the parties as to whether in such
circumstance the Purchaser Termination Fee should be $15,000,000 or
$35,000,000, then Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar Companies $15,000,000
within 2 Business Days after such termination, or in the case of clause
8.03(a)(2) above immediately prior to and as a condition to such termination,
with the remainder (if any) of the Purchaser Termination Fee remaining
payable, and the Cliffstar Companies acceptance of such $15,000,000 shall not
in any way prejudice their rights to the remainder (if any) of the Purchaser
Termination Fee, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Cliffstar
Companies right to receive payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 8.03 in circumstances where such fee is payable shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Cliffstar Companies against Purchaser and
Purchaser Sub for any breach, including Willful Breach, loss or damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the transaction to be consummated,
other than for fraud, and upon payment of such amount, none of Purchaser or
Purchaser Sub shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of a party hereto or another person or otherwise. In all other
circumstances, other than fraud, losses recoverable by the Cliffstar
Companies from Purchaser and Purchaser Sub for any such breach, loss or damage
shall not exceed $35,000,000, except for matters covered by indemnification
after the Closing.

 



 

77 (f) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that Purchaser shall fail to pay
the Purchaser Termination Fee when due, Purchaser and Purchaser Sub shall
reimburse, subject to the limitations on Losses in Section 8.03(e), the
Cliffstar Companies for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by such other party (including reasonable expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.03.

8.04 _Waiver_. Any extension or waiver of the requirements hereunder shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to
be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term
or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement.
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

 _TAXES_

 

9.01 _Property Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent not already paid, any property Taxes measured by the
amount, value or level of any item (such as personal property Taxes or real
estate Taxes) (" _Property Taxes_ ") imposed on or with respect to the Assets
on a periodic basis relating to a period beginning on or before and ending
after the Closing Date (the " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be allocated to the
Cliffstar Companies, on the one hand, and Purchaser and Purchaser Sub, on the
other, respectively, in accordance with Section 164(d) of the Code. All such
prorations shall be allocated so that items relating to time periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date shall be allocated to the Cliffstar Companies and
items relating to time periods beginning after the Closing Date shall
be allocated to Purchaser and Purchaser Sub. The amount of such prorations
shall be settled and paid on the Closing Date. With respect to any such
Property Taxes paid by Purchaser, the Cliffstar Companies shall pay to
Purchaser the amount of such Property Taxes allocated to the Cliffstar
Companies pursuant to this Section 9.01 no later than 10 days after the date
such Property Taxes are required to be paid. With respect to any such Property
Taxes paid by the Cliffstar Companies, Purchaser shall pay to the Cliffstar
Companies the amount of such Property Taxes allocated to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 9.01 no later than 10 days after the date such Property Taxes are
required to be paid.

 

9.02 _Cooperation with Respect to Property Tax Returns_. Purchaser and the
Cliffstar Companies shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and
each at their own expense, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including access to books and records) and assistance, including making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanations of any material provided, relating to
a Cliffstar Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Property
Tax Return.



 

78 9.03 _Disputes_. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Article 9 shall
be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm and the fees and expenses of
such firm shall be borne equally by the Cliffstar Companies, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 

10.01 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Cliffstar Companies and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;  _provided_
that Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of all Transfer Taxes.

Purchaser as applicable, except that, Purchaser may elect to purchase any
portion of the Assets through one or more directly or indirectly, wholly-owned

shall not relieve Purchaser or Purchaser Sub of any of its obligations under
this Agreement and the Cliffstar Companies shall have the right to
specifically enforce all such obligations under Section 10.13.

10.07 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns
and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any Person, other than the Cliffstar Companies, Purchaser and Purchaser Sub,
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

10.08 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a)

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. In the event of any controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement, each of the parties hereto irrevocably (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State Supreme Court sitting in the County of Erie
or the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, (b) waives
any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any
action or proceeding brought in any such court, (c) waives any claim that such
action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that there
is a more convenient forum for such action or proceeding, and (d) agrees that
service of process or of any other papers upon such party by registered mail
at the address to which notices are required to be sent to such party under
Section 10.02 shall be deemed good, proper and effective service upon such
party.

10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or any of
the actions of any party hereto in negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement thereof. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any of the other parties has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that any of the other parties would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
10.11.

10.12 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Cliffstar
Companies and Purchaser shall not issue any press release or public
announcement concerning

  

 

81  this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without prior
consultation with and written approval of the other parties hereto, which
approval will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, unless
disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules
of any stock exchange, _provided_ that, to the extent required by applicable
Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange, the party intending to
make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with such applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange to consult with
the other party with respect to the text thereof and to consider in good
faith any proposed modifications thereto.

10.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section
8.03 (which provides that the sole remedy of the other party in circumstances
where a Termination Fee is payable by a party is the payment of that fee),
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Cliffstar Companies, on the other hand,
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other (as applicable) and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and applicable Laws and to thereafter cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement. Other
than the Purchaser Termination Fee, which for the sake of clarity shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy in such events described in Section 8.03, (A) the
foregoing rights are in addition to and without limitation of any other remedy
to which the parties may be entitled at law or in equity, (B) the parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy,
and (C) each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any party
brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party and the End Date has not yet passed, the
End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during
which such Action is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (y) such other time
period established by the New York court presiding over such Action.

10.14  _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) Star shall be appointed and authorized as agent and representative under
this Agreement (the " _Sellers_ __ _Representative_ ") to take such action,
as he determines in his judgment appropriate, on behalf of the Cliffstar
Companies, to exercise such rights, power and authority, as such
Cliffstar Company may have under this Agreement and otherwise as are
authorized, delegated and granted to the Sellers Representative on behalf of
such Persons. If Sellers Representative shall be unable or unwilling to serve
in such capacity, Sellers Representative, or his estate or legal guardian,
as applicable, shall promptly appoint a successor.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not (i) be liable to the Cliffstar
Companies for any actions taken or omitted to be taken by him or any agent
employed by him under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (ii) owe



 

82  any fiduciary duty or have any fiduciary responsibility to any of the
Cliffstar Companies as a result of actions taken as the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except for such actions taken or
omitted to be taken resulting from the Sellers Representatives willful
misconduct. The Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Cliffstar
Company for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by him in good
faith, and, if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Cliffstar
Company to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other
Cliffstar Companies, as applicable, any payment in excess of the amount to
which they are determined to have been entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

10.15 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. For the
convenience of the parties, any number of counterparts hereof may be
executed, each such executed counterpart shall be deemed an original and all
such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Facsimile transmission (including the e-mail delivery of documents in Adobe
PDF format) of any signed original counterpart and/or retransmission of any
signed facsimile transmission shall be deemed the same as the delivery of an
original.

 

10.16 _Disclosure_. The written disclosures by the Cliffstar Companies in this
Agreement, the Sellers Disclosure Letter, or any schedule or exhibit hereto
or in any other related document of such information as is not required under
the terms hereof or thereof to be disclosed herein or therein shall not affect
the standards of materiality or disclosure applicable to this Agreement and
the schedules and exhibits hereto or such other related document.
