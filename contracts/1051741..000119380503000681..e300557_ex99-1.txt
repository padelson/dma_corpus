Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which
action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing, neither
FNFG, TFC nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any
action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be

received an opinion of counsel to FNFG that there are no adverse Federal or
state income tax consequences to TFC stockholders as a result of the
modification; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of TFC Common
Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in
amount; (iii) such modification will not delay materially or jeopardize receipt
of any required regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals relating to
the consummation of the Merger; and (iv) TFC is consulted as to the proposed
alternative structure and the reasons therefor. The parties hereto agree to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to reflect
any such revised structure.

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

      3.1. Conversion of TFC Common Stock; Merger Consideration.

      At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of FNFG, TFC or the holders of any of the shares of TFC Common Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

            3.1.1. Each share of FNFG Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

            3.1.2. All shares of TFC Common Stock held in the treasury of TFC
and each share of TFC Common Stock owned by FNFG or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of FNFG or First Niagara Bank or of TFC immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or
in connection with debts previously contracted) shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made
in consideration therefor.

            3.1.3. Each outstanding share of TFC Common Stock that under the
terms of Section 3.2 is subject to an All Stock Election, shall be converted
into and become the right to receive that number of shares of FNFG Common Stock
as determined in accordance with the following: (A) if the Average Closing Price
is equal to or greater than $13.82480 and less than or equal to $17.59520, such
number of shares of FNFG Common Stock as shall equal $35.50 divided by the
Average Closing Price, rounded to five decimal places; (B) if the Average
Closing Price is less than $13.82480, 2.56785 shares of FNFG Common Stock; and
(C) if the Average Closing Price is greater than $17.59520, 2.01760 shares of
FNFG Common Stock.

            3.1.4. For purposes of this Section 3.1, the following terms have
the following meanings: (i) "Average Closing Price" shall mean the average of
the Closing Prices of FNFG Common Stock on the five Trading Days immediately
preceding the Determination Date; (ii) "Closing Price" shall mean the closing
sale price of FNFG Common Stock on a Trading Day as supplied by the Nasdaq
National Market; (iii) "Trading Day" shall mean a day for which a Closing Price
is so supplied; and (iv) the "Determination Date" shall mean the first date on

                                       9
<PAGE>

            3.1.5. Each outstanding share of TFC Common Stock that under the
terms of Section 3.2 is subject to an All Cash Election, shall be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment of $35.50.

            3.1.6. Each outstanding share of TFC Common Stock that under the
terms of Section 3.2 is subject to a Cash/Stock Election, shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) a cash payment of $15.26500, plus (ii) that number
of shares of FNFG Common Stock as determined in accordance with the following:
(A) if the Average Closing Price is equal to or greater than $13.82480 and less
than or equal to $17.59520, such number of shares of FNFG Common Stock as shall
equal $20.23500 divided by the Average Closing Price, rounded to five decimal
places; (B) if the Average Closing Price is less than $13.82480, 1.46367 shares
of FNFG Common Stock; and (C) if the Average Closing Price is greater than
$17.59520, 1.15003 shares of FNFG Common Stock.

            3.1.7. Each outstanding share of TFC Common Stock the holder of
which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive shares of FNFG
Common Stock or cash hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL. TFC shall give FNFG prompt notice upon
receipt by TFC of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares
of TFC Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments
provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand
being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Shareholder"), and FNFG shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. TFC shall not, except with the prior written consent of FNFG,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder
as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Company.

            3.1.8. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective Time, such holder's shares of TFC Common Stock shall be
converted into a right to receive cash or FNFG Common Stock in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline), each share of TFC
Common Stock of such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis as an
All Cash Election, an All Stock Election, or a Cash/Stock Election, as FNFG
shall determine in its sole discretion.

            3.1.9. After the Effective Time, shares of TFC Common Stock shall be
no longer outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this section be the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

            3.1.10. In the event FNFG changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of FNFG Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding FNFG Common Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of FNFG
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the All Stock or the Cash/Stock Election shall
be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; provided, that no such adjustment
shall be made with regard to FNFG Common Stock if FNFG issues additional shares
of Common Stock and receives fair market value consideration for such shares.


                                       10
<PAGE>

            3.1.11. The consideration that any one TFC shareholder may receive
pursuant to Article III is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration" and
the consideration that all of the TFC shareholders are entitled to receive
pursuant to Article III (including with respect to TFC Options and the Rabbi
Trust Shares) is referred to herein as the "Aggregate Merger Consideration".

      3.2. Election Procedures.

      Holders of TFC Common Stock may elect to receive shares of FNFG Common
Stock or cash in exchange for their shares of TFC Common Stock in accordance
with the following procedures, provided that in the aggregate (and including
cash payments relating to TFC Options), the cash consideration payable with
respect to TFC Common Stock shall not exceed $166,504,730 (the "Cash
Consideration Amount"), subject to the following sentence as well as Section
3.2.6. The allocation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration between cash and
shares of FNFG Common Stock shall be determined pursuant to this Section 3.2,
provided that FNFG shall under no circumstance issue more than 13,800,000 shares
of FNFG common stock in this transaction (the "Maximum Share Amount").
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, if the number of shares of FNFG Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to this Section 3.2 would be in excess of the
Maximum Share Amount, then a sufficient number of shares subject to the All
Stock Elections shall be chosen by FNFG on a pro rata basis, by lot or other
equitable method to be treated as All Cash Election Shares pursuant to Section
3.2.8, such that the number of shares to be issued by FNFG is no more than the
Maximum Share Amount.

            3.2.1. An election form, in such form as FNFG and TFC shall mutually
agree ("Election Form"), will be sent, on the date that the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus is mailed (the "Mailing Date"), to each holder of record of
TFC Common Stock permitting such holder, subject to the allocation and election
procedures set forth in this Section 3.2, (i) to elect to receive cash for all
of such shares (an "All Cash Election"), in accordance with the provision of
Section 3.1.5, (ii) to elect to receive FNFG Common Stock for all of such shares
(an "All Stock Election"), in accordance with the provision of Section 3.1.3,
(iii) elect to receive a combination of cash and shares of FNFG Common Stock for
such shares (a "Cash/Stock Election"), in accordance with the provision of
Section 3.1.6, or (iv) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as
to the receipt of cash or FNFG Common Stock for such shares (a "Non-Election").
Holders of record of shares of TFC Common Stock who hold such shares as
nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative")
may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers
all the shares of TFC Common Stock held by each Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Any shares of TFC Common Stock with respect to which the
holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an election by
submission to the Exchange Agent on an effective, properly completed Election
Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. Non-Election Shares may be converted
on a share by share basis as an All Cash Election, an All Stock Election, or a
Cash/Stock Election, as FNFG shall determine in its sole discretion. Any
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed shares subject to an All Cash Election, and
with respect to such shares the holders thereof shall in no event receive
consideration comprised of FNFG Common Stock.


                                       11
<PAGE>

            3.2.2. The term "Election Deadline", as used below, shall mean 5:00
p.m., Eastern time, on the 20th business day following the Mailing Date, or such
other date as TFC and FNFG shall mutually agree upon. An election shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may
be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of
revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to
the Election Deadline. The Certificate or Certificates relating to any revoked
Election Form shall be promptly returned without charge to the person submitting
the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall have
discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made.

            3.2.3. If the number of shares of TFC Common Stock subject to All
Cash Elections (the "All Cash Election Shares") plus the number of shares of TFC
Common Stock subject to Cash/Stock Elections in the aggregate results in cash
consideration that exceeds the Cash Consideration Amount, all shares of TFC
Common Stock covered by All Stock Elections (the "All Stock Election Shares")
and the Cash/Stock Elections (the "Mixed Election Shares") shall be converted as
requested, all shares of TFC Common Stock covered by Non-Elections (the
"Non-Election Shares") shall be treated as All Stock Election Shares, and the
All Cash Election Shares shall be converted in the following manner: (i) the
Exchange Agent will select from among the holders of All Cash Election Shares,
on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of such shares, which shares shall be
deemed All Stock Election Shares ("Stock Designated Shares") such that the
number of All Cash Election Shares, less the Stock Designated Shares, plus the
number of shares of Mixed Election Shares, in the aggregate results in cash
merger consideration that is approximately equal to the Cash Consideration
Amount, and all such Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive FNFG Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.1.3; and (ii) the All
Cash Election Shares not so selected as Stock Designated Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 3.1.5.

            3.2.4. If the number of All Cash Election Shares plus the number of
shares of Mixed Election Shares in the aggregate results in cash consideration
that is less than the Cash Consideration Amount, the All Cash Election Shares
and the Mixed Election Shares shall be converted as requested, all Non-Election
Shares shall be considered Cash Election Shares, and the All Stock Election
Shares shall be converted in the following manner: (i) the Exchange Agent will
select from among the holders of All Stock Election Shares, on a pro rata basis,
a sufficient number of such shares, which shares shall be deemed All Cash
Election Shares ("Cash Designated Shares") such that the number of Cash
Designated Shares will, when added to the number of Cash Election Shares, the
Non-Election Shares and the Mixed Election Shares, in the aggregate result in
cash merger consideration that is approximately equal to the Cash Consideration
Amount, and all such Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive cash in accordance with Section 3.1.5; and (ii) the All Stock Election
Shares not so selected as Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive FNFG Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.1.3.


                                       12
<PAGE>

            3.2.5. In the event that neither Section 3.2.3 nor Section 3.2.4
above is applicable, the All Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive cash in accordance with Section 3.1.5, the All Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive FNFG Common Stock in
accordance with Section 3.1.3, the Mixed Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive cash and FNFG Common Stock in accordance with Section
3.1.6, and the Non-Election Shares shall be treated as All Cash Election Shares,
All Stock Election Shares, or Mixed Election Shares by the Exchange Agent so
that in the aggregate the cash merger consideration equals the Cash
Consideration Amount as closely as possible.

            3.2.6. If the tax opinion referred to in Section 9.1.6 and to be
delivered at the Closing (the "Tax Opinion") cannot be rendered as a result of
the Merger's potentially failing to satisfy continuity of interest requirements
under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under
Section 368(a) of the Code, because the aggregate value of the shares of FNFG
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger as of the Effective Time is less than
40% of the value of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, then the allocation
procedures set forth in Section 3.2.3 shall be followed to the minimum extent
necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 368(a) of the Code.

            3.2.7. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of FNFG Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to FNFG Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
other rights of a stockholder of FNFG. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, FNFG shall pay to each former holder of TFC Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of FNFG Common Stock,
an amount in cash determined by multiplying the Average Closing Price by the
fraction of a share of FNFG Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1.3 hereof. No interest will be paid
on the cash that the holders of such fractional shares shall be entitled to
receive upon such delivery. For purposes of determining any fractional share
interest, all shares of TFC Common Stock owned by a TFC shareholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of FNFG Common
Stock issuable to such TFC shareholder.

      3.3. Procedures for Exchange of TFC Common Stock.

            3.3.1. FNFG to Make Merger Consideration Available. After the
Election Deadline and no later than the Closing Date, FNFG shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of TFC Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3,
certificates representing the shares of FNFG Common Stock and an amount of cash
equal to the Cash Consideration Amount and any cash that may be payable in lieu
of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of FNFG Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").


                                       13
<PAGE>

            3.3.2. Exchange of Certificates. FNFG shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates, a form letter of
transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for certificates representing, as
the case may be, the shares of FNFG Common Stock, cash in respect of the Cash
Election Price, and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the TFC Common
Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a result of
the Merger. The letter of transmittal (which shall be subject to the reasonable
approval of TFC) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that
number of shares of FNFG Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of
TFC Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof, (ii) a check representing that amount of cash (if
any) to which such former holder of TFC Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof and (iii) a check
representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of
FNFG Common Stock, which such former holder has the right to receive in respect
of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.2,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person who is an "affiliate" of TFC
for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act shall not be exchanged for
certificates representing shares of FNFG Common Stock until FNFG has received
the written agreement of such person contemplated by Section 8.4 hereof.

            3.3.3. Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time. The
holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and
outstanding TFC Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time,
with respect to such TFC Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in
exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect
to FNFG Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of FNFG Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

            3.3.4. Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal is
not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment of
the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to such
Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate, and is
otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence
of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the
letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

<PAGE>

            3.3.5. Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of TFC of the TFC Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

            3.3.6. Return of Exchange Fund. At any time following the six (6)
month period after the Effective Time, FNFG shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had been
made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to FNFG (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither FNFG nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered
in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law.

            3.3.7. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by FNFG, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as FNFG may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

            3.3.8. Withholding. FNFG or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of TFC Common
Stock such amounts as FNFG (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S.
tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by FNFG or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the TFC Common Stock in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding were made by FNFG or the Exchange Agent.

      3.4. Treatment of TFC Options.

            Prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, TFC shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the TFC Option Plan. In accordance with Section
17 of the TFC Option Plan, for a period of fifteen days prior to the Effective
Time, all issued and outstanding TFC Options not theretofore exercisable (the
"Unexercisable TFC Options"), shall become immediately exercisable and otherwise
subject to the terms of the TFC Option Plan. Holders of all TFC Options,
including Unexercisable TFC Options, will be given the opportunity to elect to
receive, in cancellation of their TFC Option, a cash payment from TFC
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of TFC Common Stock provided for in such TFC Option and
(y) the excess, if any, of $35.50 over the exercise price per share provided for
in such TFC Option (the "Cash Option Election"), which cash payment shall be
treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable federal or state
withholding tax. Subject to the foregoing, TFC Options not exercised prior to
the Effective Time shall terminate, in accordance with the provisions of Section
17.3 of the TFC Option Plan. TFC shall send a written notice to all holders of
TFC Options (in accordance with Section 17.3 of the TFC Option Plan) informing
option holders of their right to exercise, of the Cash Option Election, and of
the termination of the unexercised TFC Options as of the Effective Time.

4.9.3, no plan, contract, employment agreement, termination agreement, or
similar agreement or arrangement to which TFC or any TFC Subsidiary is a party
or under which TFC or any TFC Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions which
permit an employee or independent contractor to terminate it without cause and
continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in TFC

material assets and properties owned by TFC or each TFC Subsidiary in the
conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the
balance sheets contained in the TFC Regulatory Reports and in the TFC Financial
Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets
and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since
the date of such balance sheets), subject to no material encumbrances, liens,
mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure
liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing
from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any
transaction by an TFC Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii)
statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in
good faith. TFC and the TFC Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid
and existing leases of real and personal properties used by TFC and its
Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such
properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases
and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both
tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental
commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed
in all material respects in the notes to the TFC Financial Statements.

            4.10.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which
TFC or any TFC Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell, if any, TFC or such TFC Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or
security interest (which to TFC's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in
the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

            4.10.3. TFC and each TFC Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations.
Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary, except as disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.10.3, has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. There are presently no material claims pending
under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by TFC or any
TFC Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect, and within the last three years TFC and each TFC
Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied
and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any material
claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.10.3 identifies all policies of insurance maintained by TFC and each TFC
Subsidiary as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this
Section.

authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to the
Knowledge of TFC, no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license,
certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
obtaining the approvals set forth in Section 8.3.

            4.12.3. For the period beginning January 1, 2000, neither TFC nor
any TFC Subsidiary has received any written notification or to TFC's Knowledge
any other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that TFC or any
TFC Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening
to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is
material to TFC or any TFC Subsidiary; (iii) requiring or threatening to require
TFC or any TFC Subsidiary, or indicating that TFC or any TFC Subsidiary may be
required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of
understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental
agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks
or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or
purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the operations of TFC
or any TFC Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting
to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of TFC or any TFC
Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of
dividends (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order
described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory
Agreement"). Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary has consented to or entered into
any Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect or that was in effect since
January 1, 1998. The most recent regulatory rating given to TSB as to compliance
with the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") is satisfactory or better.

      4.13. Employee Benefit Plans.

            4.13.1. TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1 includes a list of all
existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
severance, welfare benefit plans, fringe benefit plans, employment, severance
and change in control agreements and all other material benefit practices,
policies and arrangements maintained by TFC or any TFC Subsidiary in which any
employee or former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or
former director of TFC or any TFC Subsidiary participates or to which any such
employee, consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive
benefits (the "Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth in TFC
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1, neither TFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
commitment to create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to
materially modify, change or renew any existing Compensation and Benefit Plan
(any modification or change that increases the cost of such plans would be
deemed material), except as required to maintain the qualified status thereof,
TFC has made available to FNFG true and correct copies of the Compensation and
Benefit Plans.

            4.13.2. To the Knowledge of TFC or TFC Subsidiary and except as
disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.2, each Compensation and Benefit Plan
has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable
law have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions
for late filings have been paid in full. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS,
and TFC is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result
in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no material
pending or, to the Knowledge of TFC, threatened action, suit or claim relating
to any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or
omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject TFC or any TFC Subsidiary to an
unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

            4.13.3. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, no
liability, other than PBGC premiums arising in the ordinary course of business,
has been or is expected by TFC or any of its Subsidiaries to be incurred with
respect to any TFC Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a defined benefit plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("TFC Defined Benefit Plan"), or with respect to
any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or
formerly maintained by TFC or any entity which is considered one employer with
TFC under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred to as an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). To
the Knowledge of TFC and any TFC Subsidiary, except as set forth in TFC
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, no TFC Defined Benefit Plan had an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived,
as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the
date hereof. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, the fair
market value of the assets of each TFC Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present
value of the benefits guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA under such TFC
Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year with respect to
the respective TFC Defined Benefit Plan ending prior to the date hereof,
calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent
actuarial valuation for such TFC Defined Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and
no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to
be filed for any TFC Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month period ending on
the date hereof. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, neither
TFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide,
security to any TFC Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any
action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code
or pursuant to ERISA. Neither TFC, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has
contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
on or after January 1, 1998. To the Knowledge of TFC, and except as set forth in
TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, there is no pending investigation or enforcement
action by any Bank Regulator with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan
or any ERISA Affiliate Plan.

            4.13.4. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.4, all
material contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation
and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit arrangements to
which TFC or any TFC Subsidiary is a party or a sponsor have been timely made,
and all anticipated contributions and funding obligations are accrued on TFC's
consolidated financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. TFC and its
Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of
future benefits under each applicable Compensation and Benefit Plan for
financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.


                                       25
<PAGE>

            4.13.5. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.5,
neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree
health, life insurance, disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section
4980B of the Code. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.5, there
has been no communication to employees by TFC or any TFC Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health,
life insurance, disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits.

            4.13.6. Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.6, TFC
and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Compensation and Benefit Plans covering
employees who are not United States residents.

            4.13.7. With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if
applicable, TFC has provided or made available to FNFG copies of the: (A) trust
instruments and insurance contracts; (B) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with
the IRS; (C) most recent actuarial report and financial statement; (D) most
recent summary plan description; (E) most recent determination letter issued by
the IRS; (F) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS within the last two
years; and (G) most recent nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the
Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests).

            4.13.8. Except as disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.8, the
consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment or service at any time
prior to or following the Effective Time) (A) entitle any employee, consultant
or director to any payment or benefit (including severance pay, change in
control benefit, or similar compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B)
result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under
any Compensation and Benefit Plan.

            4.13.9. Except as disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.9,
neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements under which any payment is reasonably likely to become
non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of
the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.

            4.13.10. To the Knowledge of TFC, the consummation of the Mergers
will not, directly or indirectly (including without limitation, as a result of
any termination of employment or service at any time prior to or following the
Effective Time), entitle any current or former employee, director or independent
contractor of TFC or any TFC Subsidiary to any actual or deemed payment (or
benefit) which could constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is defined
in Section 280G of the Code), except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.13.10.


                                       26
<PAGE>

            4.13.11. Except as disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.11,
there are no stock appreciation or similar rights, earned dividends or dividend
equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding under any of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the date hereof and none will
be granted, awarded, or credited after the date hereof.

            4.13.12. TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.12 sets forth, as of the
payroll date immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, a list of the
full names of all employees of TSB or TFC, their title and rate of salary, and
their date of hire. TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.12 also sets forth any changes
to any TFC Compensation and Benefit Plan since September 30, 2002.

      4.14. Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors.

      Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or,
except for its commitments including to those it has professionally engaged and
disclosed in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.14, incurred any liability or commitment
for any fees or commissions to any such person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which has not been reflected in the
TFC Financial Statements.

      4.15. Environmental Matters.

            4.15.1. Except as may be set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.15
and any Phase I Environmental Report identified therein, with respect to TFC and
each TFC Subsidiary:

                  (A) Each of TFC and the TFC Subsidiaries, the Participation
Facilities, and, to TFC's Knowledge, the Loan Properties are, and have been, in
substantial compliance with, and are not liable under, any Environmental Laws;

                  (B) TFC has received no written notice that there is any suit,

any of the TFC Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility (x) for alleged
noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any
Environmental Law or (y) relating to the presence of or release (as defined
herein) into the environment of any Materials of Environmental Concern (as

such Loan Property) (x) relating to alleged noncompliance (including by any

groundwater or surface water on, or under the properties, and buildings thereon)
are not contaminated with and do not otherwise contain any Materials of
Environmental Concern other than as permitted under applicable Environmental
Law;

                  (E) Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary has received any

                  (F) To TFC's Knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks
on, in or under any properties owned or operated by TFC or any of the TFC
Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility, and to TFC's Knowledge, no

and

                  (G) To TFC's Knowledge, during the period of (s) TFC's or any

"Criticized", "Watch list" or words of similar import, together with the
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the
identity of the obligor thereunder, (4) where a reasonable doubt exists as to
the timely future collectability of principal and/or interest, whether or not
interest is still accruing or the loans are less than 90 days past due, (5)
where the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have
been extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrower's ability to pay in accordance
with such initial terms, or (6) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith, and (G) all assets classified by TSB or any TSB Subsidiary
as real estate acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure, including
in-substance foreclosures, and all other assets currently held that were
acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure. DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.16.2 may exclude any individual loan with a principal outstanding balance of
less than $100,000, provided that DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.16.2 includes, for each
category described, the aggregate amount of individual loans with a principal
outstanding balance of less than $100,000 that have been excluded.

            4.16.3. All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued
interest entered on the books of TFC and the TFC Subsidiaries arose out of bona
fide arm's-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the ordinary course of TFC's or the appropriate TFC Subsidiary's respective
business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to such
loans (including discounts) are true and genuine and are what they purport to
be, except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.16.3. To the Knowledge of
TFC, the loans, discounts and the accrued interest reflected on the books of TFC
and the TFC Subsidiaries are subject to no defenses, set-offs or counterclaims
(including, without limitation, those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending
laws), except as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity. Except
as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.16.3, all such loans are owned by TFC
or the appropriate TFC Subsidiary free and clear of any liens.


                                       29
<PAGE>

            4.16.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the
loans described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other

      TFC has made available to FNFG copies of its (i) annual reports on Form
10-K for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, (ii) quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, and (iii) proxy
materials used or for use in connection with its meetings of shareholders held
in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Such reports, prospectus and proxy materials complied,
at the time filed with the SEC, in all material respects, with the Securities
Laws.

      4.18. Related Party Transactions.

      Except as described in TFC's Proxy Statement distributed in connection
with the annual meeting of shareholders held in January 2003 (which has
previously been provided to FNFG), or as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.18, neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary is a party to any transaction
(including any loan or other credit accommodation) with any Affiliate of TFC or
any TFC Affiliate. All such transactions (a) were made in the ordinary course of
business, (b) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve more than the normal
risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. No loan or credit
accommodation to any Affiliate of TFC or any TFC Subsidiary is presently in
default or, during the three year period prior to the date of this Agreement,
has been in default or has been restructured, modified or extended. Neither TFC
nor any TFC Subsidiary has been notified that principal and interest with
respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid when due
or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit accommodation
by TFC is inappropriate.

      4.19. Deposits.

      Except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.20, none of the deposits
of TFC or any TFC Subsidiary is a "brokered deposit" as defined in 12 CFR

      4.20. Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable; Required Vote.

      The Board of Directors of TFC has, to the extent such statute is
applicable, taken all action (including appropriate approvals of the Board of
Directors of TFC) necessary to exempt FNFG, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby from Section 203 of the DGCL. The Merger is
not a "Control Share Acquisition" for purposes of Section 9 of the TFC
Certificate of Incorporation by reason of Section 9.7 thereof. The affirmative
vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of TFC Common Stock is
required to approve this Agreement and the Merger under TFC's certificate of
incorporation and the DGCL.

      4.21. Registration Obligations.

      Neither TFC nor any TFC Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, which will survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement to
register any transaction involving any of its securities under the Securities
Act.

      4.22. Risk Management Instruments.

      All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures
and forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for TFC's own account, or for the account of one or more of TFC's
Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.23), were in all material respects entered into in compliance with
all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies, and to the
Knowledge of TFC and each TFC Subsidiary, with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time; and to TFC's and TFC Subsidiary's Knowledge
each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of TFC or one
of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity
principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither TFC nor any TFC
Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of TFC any other party thereto, is in breach of
any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement in any material
respect.

      4.23. Fairness Opinion.

      TFC has received a written opinion from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
("KBW") to the effect that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications
set forth therein, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be
received by the stockholders of TFC pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended
or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

      4.24. Trust Accounts

      TSB and each of its subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts
for which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for
which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian,
conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing
documents and applicable laws and regulations. Neither TSB nor any other TFC
Subsidiary, and to their Knowledge, nor has any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account and the records for each such fiduciary account.

challenging such compliance. With respect to each of the FNFG Compensation and

            5.12.2. To the Knowledge of FNFG and except as disclosed in FNFG
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.2, each FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms

that would reasonably be expected to subject FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary to an
unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

            5.12.3. No liability, other than PBGC premiums arising in the
ordinary course of business, has been or is expected by FNFG or any of its
Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any FNFG Compensation and Benefit
Plan which is a defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA ("FNFG Defined
Benefit Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by FNFG or any entity
which is considered one employer with FNFG under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred
to as an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). To the Knowledge of FNFG, except as set forth
in FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.3, no FNFG Defined Benefit Plan had an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether
or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending
prior to the date hereof. Except as set forth in FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
5.12.3, the fair market value of the assets of each FNFG Defined Benefit Plan
exceeds the present value of the benefits guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA
under such FNFG Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year
with respect to the respective FNFG Defined Benefit Plan ending prior to the
date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the
most recent actuarial valuation for such FNFG Defined Benefit Plan as of the
date hereof; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043
of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has
been required to be filed for any FNFG Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof. Neither FNFG nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any FNFG Defined Benefit Plan
or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any action, or omitted to take any action,
that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition
of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA. Neither FNFG,
its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer
plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after January 1, 1998. To the
Knowledge of FNFG, there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by
any Bank Regulator with respect to any FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan or any
ERISA Affiliate Plan.

            5.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the
terms of any FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any
employee benefit arrangements to which FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary is a party or
a sponsor have been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding
obligations are accrued on FNFG's consolidated financial statements to the
extent required by GAAP. FNFG and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as
a liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable FNFG
Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes as required by
GAAP.

or agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a lien, results or resulted
in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon FNFG or
any of FNFG Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of FNFG, no condition has existed or
event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that, with
notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any
material liability to FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental
Laws. Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any Person that FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary or the operation or condition of any
property ever owned, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity
by any of them are currently in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have
financial exposure under any Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of
Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or
potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials
of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property)
for which a material liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon FNFG or
any FNFG Subsidiary.

            5.13.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or
administrative order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the
FNFG `s Knowledge, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other
forum against FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law
or (y) relating to the presence of or release (defined herein) into the

90 days past due, (5) where the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the
maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the agreement under which the

allocation exists in connection therewith; and all assets classified by of FNFG

entered into for FNFG's own account, or for the account of one or more of FNFG's
Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects entered into in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies,
and to the Knowledge of FNFG, with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of FNFG or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
or by general equity principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither FNFG
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of FNFG any other party
thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or
arrangement in any material respect.

to any such person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

to operate its business, only in the usual, regular and ordinary course of
business; use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization
and assets and maintain its rights and franchises; and voluntarily take no
action which would (i) adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain any
necessary approvals of governmental authorities required for the transactions
contemplated hereby or materially increase the period of time necessary to
obtain such approvals, or (ii) adversely affect their ability to perform its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement.

date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as otherwise specifically
permitted or required by this Agreement, set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
6.1.2, or consented to by FNFG in writing (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it will not, and it will cause

per share with payment and record dates consistent with past practice (provided
the declaration of the last quarterly dividend by TFC prior to the Effective
Time and the payment thereof shall be coordinated with FNFG so that holders of
TFC Common Stock do not receive dividends on both TFC Common Stock and FNFG
Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of such quarter or fail to
receive a dividend on at least one of the TFC Common Stock or FNFG Common Stock
received in the Merger in respect of such quarter), and (C) any TFC Subsidiary
may pay dividends to its parent company (as permitted under applicable law or
regulations).

      6.2. Current Information.

            6.2.1. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, TFC and TSB will cause one or more of its representatives to
confer with representatives of FNFG and report the general status of its ongoing
operations at such times as FNFG may reasonably request. TFC will promptly
notify FNFG of any material change in the normal course of its business or in
the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat
of material litigation involving TFC or any TFC Subsidiary.

            6.2.2. TSB and First Niagara Bank shall meet on a regular basis to
discuss and plan for the conversion of TSB's data processing and related
electronic informational systems to those used by First Niagara Bank, which
planning shall include, but not be limited to, discussion of the possible
termination by TSB of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the
Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases
and software licenses used by TSB in connection with its systems operations,
retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the
conversion, and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided
system services, it being understood that TSB shall not be obligated to take any
such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless TSB otherwise agrees, no
conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time. In the event that TSB
takes, at the request of First Niagara Bank, any action relative to third
parties to facilitate the conversion that results in the imposition of any
termination fees or charges, First Niagara Bank shall indemnify TSB for any such
fees and charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process, if for any
reason the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach of this
Agreement by TFC, or a termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1.8 or
11.1.9.

            6.2.3. TSB shall provide First Niagara Bank, within ten (10)
business days of the end of each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming
assets (the term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection, means
(i) loans that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for
Troubled Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned,
(iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due) as of the end of such month
and (iv) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, TFC shall provide First Niagara
Bank with a schedule of all loan approvals, which schedule shall indicate the
loan amount, loan type and other material features of the loan.

      6.3. Access to Properties and Records.

      Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, TFC shall permit FNFG reasonable access
upon reasonable notice to its properties and those of the TFC Subsidiaries, and
shall disclose and make available to FNFG during normal business hours all of
its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account
(including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors' (other
than minutes that discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other subject matter TFC reasonably determines should be treated as
confidential) and stockholders' meetings, organizational documents, Bylaws,
material contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority,
litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business activities
or prospects in which FNFG may have a reasonable interest; provided, however,
that TFC shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel. TFC shall provide and shall
request its auditors to provide FNFG with such historical financial information
regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as FNFG may reasonably
request for securities disclosure purposes. FNFG shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with TFC's regular business
operations during any such access to TFC's property, books and records. TFC and
each TFC Subsidiary shall permit FNFG, at its expense, to cause a "phase I
environmental audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at any
physical location owned or occupied by TFC or any TFC Subsidiary.

            6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, TFC will furnish to FNFG
copies of each annual, interim or special audit of the books of TFC and the TFC
Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and copies of all internal
control reports submitted to TFC by such accountants in connection with each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of TFC and the TFC Subsidiaries
made by such accountants.

            6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than
the date such documents are filed with the SEC, TFC will deliver to FNFG the
Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws. TFC
will furnish to FNFG copies of all documents, statements and reports as it or
any TFC Subsidiary shall send to its stockholders, the FDIC, the FRB, the
Department or any other regulatory authority, except as legally prohibited
thereby. Within 25 days after the end of each month, TFC will deliver to FNFG a
consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations, without
related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current financial
reporting practices.

            6.4.3. TFC will advise FNFG promptly of the receipt of any
examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or
activities of TFC or any of the TFC Subsidiaries.

            6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, TFC will furnish to FNFG such
additional financial data that TFC possesses and as FNFG may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports.

      6.5. Maintenance of Insurance.

      TFC and TSB shall maintain, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to

nature of its business

      6.6. Disclosure Supplements.

      From time to time prior to the Effective Time, TFC and TSB will promptly
supplement or amend the TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith
with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any
information in such TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article IX.

      6.7. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

      TFC and TSB shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as
soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, TFC shall utilize
the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm to provide assistance in
obtaining the shareholder vote required to be obtained by it hereunder.

      6.8. All Reasonable Efforts.

      Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, TFC and TSB agree to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      6.9. Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

      In the event that TFC or TSB determines that a condition to its obligation
to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify FNFG.

      6.10. No Solicitation.

      From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither TFC, nor any TFC Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, agents or affiliates (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by TFC or any
of its Subsidiaries), will, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or
assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),
or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person
or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal
or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors, or employees or any of its subsidiaries or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by any of its subsidiaries to take any such action, and
TFC shall notify FNFG orally (within one business day) and in writing (as
promptly as practicable) of all of the relevant details relating to all
inquiries and proposals which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any such officer,
director, employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative may receive relating to any of such matters, provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of TFC from furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any person or entity that makes an unsolicited written
proposal to acquire TFC pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, if,
and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of TFC receives an
opinion from its independent financial advisor that such proposal may be or
could be superior to the Merger from a financial point-of-view to TFC's
stockholders, (B) the Board of Directors of TFC, after consultation with and
after considering the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good
faith that the failure to furnish information to or enter into discussions with
such person may cause the Board of Directors of TFC to breach its fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable law (such proposal that satisfies (A)
and (B) being referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal"); (C) TFC promptly
notifies FNFG of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with TFC or any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from such person
or entity an executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance identical
in all material respects to the confidentiality agreement that TFC and FNFG
entered into; and (D) the TFC Stockholders Meeting has not occurred. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or
offer as to any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated
hereunder) involving TFC or any of its subsidiaries: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of TFC, taken as a whole, in a
single transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange
offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of TFC or the
filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

      6.11. Reserves and Merger-Related Costs.

      On or before the Effective Time, TFC shall establish such additional
accruals and reserves as may be necessary to conform the accounting reserve
practices and methods (including credit loss practices and methods) of TFC to
those of FNFG (as such practices and methods are to be applied to TFC from and
after the Closing Date) and FNFG's plans with respect to the conduct of the
business of TFC following the Merger and otherwise to reflect Merger-related
expenses and costs incurred by TFC, provided, however, that TFC shall not be
required to take such action unless FNFG agrees in writing that all conditions
to closing set forth in Article IX have been satisfied or waived (except for the
expiration of any applicable waiting periods); prior to the delivery by FNFG of
the writing referred to in the preceding clause, TFC shall provide FNFG a
written statement, certified without personal liability by the chief executive
officer of TFC and dated the date of such writing, that the representation made
in Section 4.15.1 hereof is true as of such date or, alternatively, setting
forth in detail the circumstances that prevent such representation from being
true as of such date; and no accrual or reserve made by TFC or any TFC
Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation or regulatory
proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be
deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation, warranty, covenant,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or to constitute a termination
event within the meaning of Section 11.1.2 hereof. No action shall be required
to be taken by TFC pursuant to this Section 6.11 if, in the opinion of TFC's
independent auditors, such action would contravene GAAP.

      6.12. Board of Directors and Committee Meetings.

      TFC and TSB shall permit a representative of FNFG to attend any meeting of
the Board of Directors of TFC and/or TSB or the Executive Committees thereof as
an observer (the "Observer"), provided that neither TFC nor TSB shall be
required to permit the FNFG representative to remain present during any
confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or any third party proposal to acquire control of TFC or TSB or during
any other matter that the respective Board of Directors has reasonably
determined to be confidential with respect to FNFG's participation.

except with the written consent of TFC, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, each of FNFG and First Niagara Bank will
conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices and
will not take any action that would: (i) adversely affect the ability of any
party to obtain the approvals from the Bank Regulators required for the
transactions contemplated hereby or materially increase the period of time
necessary to obtain such approvals; (ii) adversely affect its ability to perform
its covenants and agreements under this Agreement; or (iii) result in the
representations and warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not
being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at any future date on or
prior to the Closing Date.

      7.2. Current Information.

      During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,

operations and business and matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, at such times as TFC may reasonably request.
FNFG will promptly notify TFC, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution of material
litigation involving FNFG and any FNFG Subsidiary.

      7.3. Financial and Other Statements.

      As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date such
documents are filed with the SEC, FNFG will deliver to TFC the Securities
Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws. FNFG will furnish
to TFC copies of all documents, statements and reports as it or FNFG file with
the OTS or any other regulatory authority with respect to the Merger.

      7.4. Disclosure Supplements.

      From time to time prior to the Effective Time, FNFG and First Niagara Bank
will promptly supplement or amend the FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in
connection herewith with respect to any material matter hereafter arising which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which
is necessary to correct any information in such FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which
has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such FNFG
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

      7.5. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

      FNFG and First Niagara Bank shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other
Persons, including the Depositors and stockholders of FNFG necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

      7.6. All Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, FNFG and First Niagara Bank agree to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

      7.7. Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

      In the event that FNFG or First Niagara Bank determine that a condition to
its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not
waive that condition, it will promptly notify TFC.

      7.8. Employee Benefits; Advisory Board.

            7.8.1. FNFG will review all other TFC Compensation and Benefit Plans
to determine whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event
employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by TFC and TSB are
changed or terminated by FNFG, in whole or in part, FNFG shall provide
Continuing Employees (as defined below) with compensation and benefits that are,
in the aggregate, substantially similar to the compensation and benefits
provided to similarly situated FNFG employees (as of the date any such
compensation or benefit is provided). All TFC Employees who become participants
in an FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan shall, for purposes of determining
eligibility for and for any applicable vesting periods of such employee benefits
only (and not for pension benefit accrual purposes) be given credit for meeting
eligibility and vesting requirements in such plans for service as an employee of
TFC or TSB or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided,
however, that credit for prior service shall not be given under the FNFG ESOP.
This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of FNFG or First
Niagara Bank to terminate the employment of any employee or to review employee
benefits programs from time to time and to make such changes as they deem
appropriate.


                                       50
<PAGE>

            7.8.2. The TFC Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "TFC ESOP") shall
be terminated as of, or prior to, the Effective Time (all shares held by the
ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
elected by the ESOP participants), all outstanding TFC ESOP indebtedness shall
be repaid, and the balance shall be allocated and distributed to TFC ESOP
participants (subject to the receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS), as provided for in the TFC ESOP and unless otherwise required by
applicable law. Prior to the Effective Time, TFC and TSB, and following the
Effective Time, FNFG and First Niagara Bank shall use their respective best
efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter (including,
but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed allocations
as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter). TFC and TSB, and following the Effective Time, FNFG and
First Niagara Bank, will adopt such amendments to the TFC ESOP as may be
reasonably required by the IRS as a condition to granting such favorable
determination letter on termination. Neither TFC or TSB, or following the
Effective Time, FNFG or First Niagara Bank shall make any distribution from the
TFC ESOP except as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such
favorable determination letter. In the case of a conflict between the terms of
this Section and the terms of the TFC ESOP, the terms of the TFC ESOP shall
control, however, in the event of any such conflict, TFC and TSB before the
Merger, and FNFG and First Niagara, after the Merger, shall use their best
efforts to cause the ESOP to be amended to conform to the requirements of this
Section.

            7.8.3. The payments required to be made under the employment
agreements between (i) TFC and TSB and (ii) each of the following individuals,
Daniel J. Hogarty ("Hogarty"), Jr., Kevin M. O'Bryan ("O'Bryan"), David J.
DeLuca ("DeLuca"), Robert P. Klein ("Klein") and Michael C. Mahar ("Mahar"),
shall be made, unless otherwise set forth herein, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and in accordance with the following principles: In the
calculation of the payment to be made under Section 8(a)(iii)(B) for Hogarty,
O'Bryan, DeLuca and Mahar, no bonus was paid or payable during the 12 month
period preceding the termination. In the calculation of the payment to be made
under Section 8(a)(iii)(1)(B) for Klein, no bonus was paid or payable during the
24 month period preceding the termination, except as set forth in TFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 7.8.3. In the calculation of the payment of benefits under Section
8(a)(iv) of such agreements: (a) the actuarial assumptions to be used in the
calculation of benefits shall be those utilized in the Actuarial Valuation
Report for the year ending September 30, 2003, for The Retirement Plan Of The
Troy Savings Bank In RSI Retirement Trust, including, but not limited to, a
Discount Rate of 6.625%; (b) that there is no stock bonus plan, no matching
contribution under any 401(k) plan, and no profit sharing plan. Set forth in TFC
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.3 is an explanation of the method for calculating the
payments required to be made under the employment agreements referenced in this
Section 7.8.3 (based upon the assumptions set forth in this Section 7.8.3). Each
of the executives referenced in this Section 7.8.3 entitled to a payment under
the employment agreements shall sign an acknowledgement in connection with the
execution of this Agreement, which shall be included in TFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
7.8.3, agreeing to the application of the principles set forth in this Section.
If requested by FNFG no earlier than December 1, 2003, TFC shall take such
action under its Long Term Equity Compensation Plan to accelerate the vesting of
such outstanding stock awards and to such individuals as specified in the FNFG
request, to a date that is on or prior to December 31, 2003, provided, however,
that the acceleration of restricted stock shall not be considered compensation,
annual compensation or base cash compensation for purposes of increasing any
payment made under any such employment, severance or change in control agreement
to which such person is a party. In addition, if requested by FNFG prior to
December 1, 2003, all or a portion of the cash payment to be made pursuant to
Section 8(a)(iii) and 8(a)(iv) of one or more of the employment agreements
referenced in this Section 7.8.3 shall be accelerated and paid by TSB prior to
December 31, 2003, provided, however, that the acceleration of such amounts
shall not be considered compensation, annual compensation or base cash
compensation for purposes of increasing any payment made under any such
employment, severance or change in control agreement to which such person is a
party. At the time of payment of the amounts set forth in Sections 8(a)(iii) and
8(a)(iv) of the employment agreements referenced in this Section 7.8.3, each
executive shall enter into an acknowledgment and release, satisfactory in form
to FNFG, acknowledging that no further payments are due under such sections and
releasing TFC, TSB, FNFG and First Niagara from any and all claims arising
thereunder.


                                       51
<PAGE>

            7.8.4. FNFG shall honor in accordance with its terms the TSB
Employee Change in Control Severance Plan.

            7.8.5. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any TFC
health plan with any FNFG health plan, FNFG shall make available to employees of
TFC or an TSB who continue employment with FNFG or a FNFG Subsidiary
("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-provided health coverage
on the same basis as it provides such coverage to FNFG employees. Unless a
Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a TFC health plan
prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate
in the FNFG health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the TFC health plans prior to the time
such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in
the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of FNFG and
their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of any TFC
health plan, terminated TFC employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the
right to continued coverage under group health plans of FNFG in accordance with
Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with the provisions below. In the event of any
termination of any TFC health plan, or consolidation of any TFC health plan with
any FNFG health plan, any coverage limitation under the FNFG health plan due to
any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the FNFG health plan to the degree
that such condition was covered by the TFC health plan and such condition would
otherwise have been covered by the FNFG health plan in the absence of such
coverage limitation. All TFC Employees who cease participating in an TFC health
plan and become participants in a comparable FNFG health plan shall receive
credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid under TFC's health plan for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under the FNFG health plan, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to FNFG
that such co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

            7.8.6. The payments required to be made pursuant to the TSB
Supplemental Retirement and Benefit Restoration Plan shall made be in accordance
with the following principles: (a) the actuarial assumptions to be used in the
calculation of benefits shall be those utilized in the Actuarial Valuation
Report for the year ending September 30, 2003, for the Retirement Plan of the
Troy Savings Bank, including, but not limited to, a Discount Rate of 6.625%; (b)
no payments shall be made under Article VI, `Savings Benefit', of such plan; and
(c) no payments shall be made under Article V, `ESOP Benefit', of such plan.
Immediately before the Effective Time, TFC and/or TSB shall take such action as
is necessary to cause First Niagara to become the administrator of the TSB
Supplemental Retirement and Benefit Restoration Plan at the Effective Time. Each
of the executives entitled to a payment under the TSB Supplemental Retirement
and Benefit Restoration Plan shall sign an acknowledgement in connection with
the execution of this Agreement, which shall be included in TFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 7.8.6, agreeing to the application of the principles set forth in this
Section.


                                       52
<PAGE>

            7.8.7. Effective as of the Closing Date, FNFG shall establish the
Capital Region Advisory Board (the "Advisory Board"). Each person who serves on
the Board of Directors of TFC or TSB (except for the director who join the FNFG
Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement) both on the date
of this Agreement and immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
appointed to the Advisory Board effective immediately following the Effective
Time. The Advisory Board shall meet quarterly, and each advisory board member
shall receive a fee of $2,500.00 for each quarterly meeting attended. The
Advisory Board shall be continued for a period of one year, unless extended by
FNFG.

            7.8.8. The TSB Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("Executive
Deferral Plan"), effective as of December 1, 1997, shall be terminated effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the benefits thereunder shall be
paid, in cash, in accordance with the terms of the Executive Deferral Plan. The
TSB Board of Trustees Amended Deferred Trustees Fees Arrangement ("Trustee
Deferral Plan") (collectively, the "Deferral Plans") shall also be terminated,
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. TSB shall designate, in
accordance with Section 9.10 of the Trustee Deferral Plan, that benefits payable
thereunder shall be paid in a single sum, at the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, TFC and/or TSB shall take such action as is necessary to cause
First Niagara to become the administrator of the Deferral Plans as of the
Effective Time.

      7.9. Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

            7.9.1. FNFG shall maintain, or shall cause First Niagara Bank to
maintain, in effect for three years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by TFC
(provided, that FNFG may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall FNFG be required to expend pursuant to
this Section 7.9.1 more than 135% of the annual cost currently expended by TFC
with respect to such insurance. In connection with the foregoing, TFC agrees in
order for FNFG to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers
liability insurance policies for three years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may request with
respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

            7.9.2. In addition to 7.9.1, for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, FNFG shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before
the Effective Time, an officer or director of TFC or a TFC Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorney's fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in

                                       53
<PAGE>

settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of FNFG,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer
or employee of TFC or a TFC Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of
fact arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable state or Federal law, FNFG's Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, and under TFC's Certificate of Incorporation or Charter and Bylaws. FNFG
shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable
state or Federal law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance
payments if he shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 7.9.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall
notify FNFG (but the failure so to notify FNFG shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 7.9.2, except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices FNFG) and shall deliver to FNFG the undertaking
referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any such Claim (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) FNFG shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such assumption FNFG shall
not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if FNFG elects not to assume
such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the
Indemnified Parties that there are or may be (whether or not any have yet
actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between FNFG and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them, and FNFG shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise
required due to conflicts of interest, FNFG shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties whose
reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid promptly as statements are received
unless there is a conflict of interest that necessitates more than one law firm,
(3) FNFG shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and (4) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder with respect to a matter as to which (x) he shall have been
adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of TFC or
any TFC Subsidiary, or (y) in the event that a proceeding is compromised or
settled so as to impose any liability or obligation upon an Indemnified Party,
if there is a determination that with respect to said matter said Indemnified
Party did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of TFC or any TFC Subsidiary. The
determination shall be made by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of the
Directors of FNFG who are not involved in such proceeding.

            7.9.3. In the event that either FNFG or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of FNFG shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.9.


                                       54
<PAGE>

            7.9.4. The obligations of FNFG provided under this Section 7.9 are
intended to be enforceable against FNFG directly by the Indemnified Parties and
shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of FNFG.

      7.10. Stock Listing.

      FNFG agrees to list on the Stock Exchange (or such other national
securities exchange on which the shares of the FNFG Common Stock shall be listed
as of the date of consummation of the Merger), subject to official notice of
issuance, the shares of FNFG Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

      7.11. Stock and Cash Reserve.

      FNFG agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares of
its common stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or borrowing
capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                          REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS

      8.1. TFC Special Meeting.

            8.1.1. TFC will (i) as promptly as practicable after the Merger
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "TFC Stockholders Meeting"), for the purpose of considering
this Agreement and the Merger, and for such other purposes as may be, in TFC's
reasonable judgment, necessary or desirable, (ii) subject to the next sentence,
have its Board of Directors recommend approval of this Agreement to the TFC
stockholders. The Board of Directors of TFC may fail to make such a
recommendation, or withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation only in
connection with a Superior Proposal, as set forth in Section 6.10 of this
Agreement, and only if such Board of Directors, after having consulted with and
considered the advice of outside counsel to such Board, has determined that the
making of such recommendation, or the failure so to withdraw, modify or change
its recommendation, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of such
directors under applicable law; and (iii) cooperate and consult with FNFG with
respect to each of the foregoing matters.

      8.2. Proxy Statement-Prospectus.

            8.2.1. For the purposes (x) of registering FNFG Common Stock to be
offered to holders of TFC Common Stock in connection with the Merger with the
SEC under the Securities Act and (y) of holding the TFC Stockholders Meeting,
FNFG shall draft and prepare, and TFC shall cooperate in the preparation of, the
Merger Registration Statement, including a combined proxy statement and
prospectus satisfying all applicable requirements of applicable state securities
and banking laws, and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed
by TFC to the TFC stockholders, together with any and all amendments or
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy
Statement-Prospectus"). FNFG shall provide TFC and its counsel with appropriate
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to the
time it is initially filed with the SEC or any amendments are filed with the
SEC. FNFG shall file the Merger Registration Statement, including the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus, with the SEC. Each of FNFG and TFC shall use their best
efforts to have the Merger Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of TFC and
FNFG shall thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its
stockholders. FNFG shall also use its best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and TFC shall furnish all
information concerning TFC and the holders of TFC Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.


                                       55
<PAGE>

            8.2.2. TFC shall provide FNFG with any information concerning itself
that FNFG may reasonably request in connection with the drafting and preparation
of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and FNFG shall notify TFC promptly of the
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to TFC
promptly copies of all correspondence between FNFG or any of their
representatives and the SEC. FNFG shall give TFC and its counsel the opportunity
to review and comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to its being filed
with the SEC and shall give TFC and its counsel the opportunity to review and
comment on all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and
all responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments
prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of FNFG and TFC
agrees to use all reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other party
hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and
to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required amendments and
supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of TFC Common Stock entitled to
vote at the TFC Stockholders Meeting hereof at the earliest practicable time.

            8.2.3. TFC and FNFG shall promptly notify the other party if at any
time it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, TFC shall cooperate with FNFG in the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus that
corrects such misstatement or omission, and FNFG shall file an amended Merger
Registration Statement with the SEC, and each of TFC and FNFG shall mail an
amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to TFC's stockholders. If requested by FNFG,
TFC shall obtain a "comfort" letter from its independent certified public
accountant, dated as of the date of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and updated
as of the date of consummation of the Merger, with respect to certain financial
information regarding TFC, in form and substance that is customary in
transactions such as the Merger.

      8.3. Regulatory Approvals.

      Each of TFC and FNFG will cooperate with the other and use all reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of the SEC, the OTS, the FRB, FDIC and the Department and any
other third parties (including the NASD and the SBA) and governmental bodies
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. TFC and
FNFG will furnish each other and each other's counsel with all information
concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders
and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and any application, petition or any other statement
or application made by or on behalf of TFC, FNFG to any Bank Regulatory or
governmental body in connection with the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. TFC shall have the right to review and approve
in advance all characterizations of the information relating to TFC and any of
its Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any governmental body. In
addition, TFC and FNFG shall each furnish to the other for review a copy of each
such filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any governmental body prior to its filing.

      8.4. Affiliates.

            8.4.1. TFC shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director,
executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule
145 under the Securities Act) of TFC to deliver to FNFG, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and at least thirty (30) days prior to the
date of the shareholders meeting called by TFC to approve this Agreement, a
written agreement, in the form of Exhibit B hereto, providing that such person
will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of FNFG
Common Stock to be received by such "affiliate," as a result of the Merger
otherwise than in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

and consents of all Bank Regulators and Governmental Entities required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been
obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all waiting periods
relating to such approvals, authorizations or consents shall have expired; and
no such approval, authorization or consent shall include any condition or
requirement, excluding standard conditions that are normally imposed by the
regulatory authorities in bank merger transactions, that would, in the good
faith reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of FNFG, materially and
adversely affect the business, operations, financial condition, property or
assets of the combined enterprise of TFC, TSB and FNFG or otherwise materially
impair the value of TFC or TSB to FNFG .

            9.1.4. Effectiveness of Merger Registration Statement. The Merger

Closing date, FNFG and TFC shall have received an opinion of Luse Gorman
Pomerenk & Schick, P.C. reasonably acceptable in form and substance to FNFG and
TFC dated as of the Closing Date, substantially to the effect that, for Federal
income tax purposes:

                  (A) The Merger, when consummated in accordance with the terms
hereof, either will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or will be treated as part of a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;

                  (B) The merger of TSB into First Niagara Bank will not
adversely affect the Merger qualifying as a Reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(A) of the Code.

                  (C) No gain or loss will be recognized by FNFG, First Niagara
Bank, TFC or TSB by reason of the Merger;

                  (D) The exchange of TFC Common Stock to the extent exchanged
for FNFG Common Stock will not give rise to recognition of gain or loss for
Federal income tax purposes to the shareholders of TFC;

                  (E) The basis of the FNFG Common Stock to be received
(including any fractional shares deemed received for tax purposes) by a TFC
shareholder will be the same as the basis of the TFC Common Stock surrendered
pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefore, increased by any gain recognized
by such TFC shareholder as a result of the Merger and decreased by any cash
received by such TFC shareholder in the Merger; and


                                       58

                  (F) The holding period of the shares of FNFG Common Stock to
be received by a shareholder of TFC will include the period during which the
shareholder held the shares of TFC Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor, provided the TFC Common Stock surrendered is held as a capital asset
at the Effective Time.

      If Luse Gorman Pomerenk & Schick, P.C. cannot or will not render this
opinion, FNFG shall accept the opinion of Hogan & Hartson, L.L.P. if it is to
the effect of the foregoing. Each of FNFG, First Niagara Bank and TFC and TSB

            11.1.10. By TFC, if its Board of Directors so determines by a

                                       62
<PAGE>

            (i) The FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date is less than
$12.56800; and

            (ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the FNFG Market Value on
the Determination Date by the Initial FNFG Market Value ("FNFG Ratio") shall be
less than the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If TFC elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to FNFG; provided, that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Effective Termination Date.
During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, FNFG
shall have the option to increase the consideration to be received by the
holders of TFC Common Stock hereunder by adjusting the exchange ratios
referenced in Section 3.1.3 and 3.1.6. As to the exchange ratio referenced in
Section 3.1.3, FNFG may adjust the All Stock Election ratio to one of the
following quotients at its sole discretion: (i) a quotient, the numerator of
which is equal to the product of the Initial FNFG Market Value, 2.56785, and the
Index Ratio minus 0.20, and the denominator of which is equal to FNFG Market
Value on the Determination Date; or (ii) a quotient determined by dividing
$12.56800 by the FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying
the quotient by 2.56785. As to the exchange ratio referenced in Section 3.1.6,
FNFG may adjust the Cash/Stock Election ratio to one of the following quotients
at its sole discretion: (i) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the
product of the Initial FNFG Market Value, 1.46367, and the Index Ratio minus
0.20, and the denominator of which is equal to FNFG Market Value on the
Determination Date; or (ii) a quotient determined by dividing $12.56800 by the
FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient by
1.46367. If FNFG so elects, it shall give, within such five-day period, written
notice to TFC of such election and the Revised Exchange Ratios, whereupon no
termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1.10
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms (except as the Revised Exchange Ratios shall have been so modified).

      For purposes of this Section 11.1.10, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

      "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation, or any

other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant
companies, (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or
more of the voting power of the relevant companies; or (iv) agree or commit to
take any action referenced above.

exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, for the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

parties hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend
this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after any approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of TFC,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment
of this Agreement which reduces the amount, value or changes the form of
consideration to be delivered to TFC's stockholders pursuant to this Agreement.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure
to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      12.1. Confidentiality.

      Except as specifically set forth herein, FNFG and TFC mutually agree to be
bound by the terms of the confidentiality agreements dated July 11, 2003 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") previously executed by the parties hereto, which
Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The
parties hereto agree that such Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in
accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding the termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that
may be relevant to the tax structure of the transaction beginning on the
earliest of (i) the date of public announcement of discussions relating to the
transaction, (ii) the date of public announcement of the transaction or (iii)
the date of the execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter
into the transaction; provided, however, that neither party (nor any employee,
representative or other agent thereof) may disclose any other information that
is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transaction (including the identity of any party and any information that could
lead another to determine the identity of any party), or any other information
to the extent that such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or
state securities law.

FNFG shall issue any news release, or other public announcement or communication
with respect to this Agreement unless such news release, public announcement or
communication has been mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto.

      12.3. Survival.

      All representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall expire on and be
terminated and extinguished at the Effective Time, except for those covenants

after the Effective Time.

      12.5. Parties in Interest.

      This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party, and that (except as provided in Article III and
Section 7.9 of this Agreement) nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer
upon any other person any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

      12.6. Complete Agreement.

      This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto and
the documents and other writings referred to herein or therein or delivered
pursuant hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, referred to in Section 12.1,
contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to
its subject matter. There are no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties,
covenants or undertakings between the parties other than those expressly set
forth herein or therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings (other than the Confidentiality Agreements referred to in Section
12.1 hereof) between the parties, both written and oral, with respect to its
subject matter.

      12.7. Counterparts.

      This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts all of which

      12.8. Severability.

      In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for
any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall
use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

      12.9. Governing Law.

      This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving
effect to its principles of conflicts of laws.

      12.10. Interpretation.

      When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this Agreement.
References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the related
Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of "Section 5.5"
and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material contained in the
subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of contents, index and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The phrases
"the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar import,
unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set
forth in the Recitals to this Agreement.

      12.11. Specific Performance.

      The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
