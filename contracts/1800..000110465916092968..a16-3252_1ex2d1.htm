accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), and shall make all other
filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate

_Secretary of State_ ") or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such
later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such
Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions,
including Section 259, of the DGCL.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation._ At

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ (a) The

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates; 
Equity-Based Awards_

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares._ All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock then held
by Parent or Merger Sub shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company or of Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall not represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at the election of
Parent, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation or (ii) canceled.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Common Appraisal Shares to be treated
in accordance with Section 2.06 and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $56.00 per share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock
held in book entry form (each, a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

 



 

(d) _Convertible Preferred Stock; Warrants_. Each share of Convertible
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding immediately following the Effective Time
as one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the
Transactions (except for the effects specifically set forth in the Certificate
of Designations). Each of the Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately following the Effective
Time and shall not be affected by the Transactions (except for the effects
specifically set forth in the Warrant Agreements).

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares._ (a) _Paying
Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section
2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services
or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a

 



      
 

 



 

holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the Company Common Stock
to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be
in such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including
customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents message" with respect
to Book Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to
the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate
or a Book Entry Share for cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
such letters instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or
Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book Entry Share surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02,
each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock._ The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of, the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that
represented ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Book Entry Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this Article II.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment
of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Taxes._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Article II such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

SECTION 2.03. _Equity-Based Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions that do not involve the payment of any consideration as may
be required to provide that:

 



 

(a) each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (other than rights
under the Company ESPP) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall,
as of the Effective Time, be

 



      
 

 



 

canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely,
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a
lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option has not been
exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , that any
such Company Stock Option with an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
canceled for no consideration; and

 



 

(b) each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive
solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards._ Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first payroll date
that occurs more than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll systems the amounts due
pursuant to Section 2.03; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
such amounts that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section
409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the
earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or
arrangement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.

 



 

SECTION 2.05. _Adjustments._ If between the date hereof and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change.

(ii) cause the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
benefits under any Company Plan, (iii) result in any "disqualified individual"
receiving any "excess parachute payment" (each such term as defined in Section

transfer the assets of any Company Plan on or following the Effective Time. No

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 



 

Parent represents and warrants to the Company:

 



 

SECTION 4.01. _Organization; Standing._ Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Illinois and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and is in good standing with the
Secretary of State. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and corporate authority necessary to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of
Parents and Merger Subs certificates of incorporation, bylaws or comparable
governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.02. _Authority; Noncontravention._ (a) Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has, or in the case of Merger Sub, will have as of the date it executes
and delivers the Joinder Agreement, all necessary corporate power and
corporate authority to execute and deliver, in the case of Parent, this
Agreement and, in the case of Merger Sub, the Joinder Agreement, to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, as applicable, and to consummate the
Transactions. The Board of Directors of Parent has adopted resolutions
approving the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. The Board of Directors of
Merger Sub, immediately prior to executing the Joinder Agreement, has adopted
resolutions (i) unanimously approving the Merger and the execution, delivery
and performance by Merger Sub of this Agreement, the Joinder Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) declaring that the Merger is advisable
and in the best interests of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and (iii)
directing that the Merger be submitted for consideration at a meeting or by
unanimous written consent of Merger Subs stockholder, which resolutions have
not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. No vote of holders of
capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
Transactions. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will approve this
Agreement and the Transactions immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Section
4.02(a), no other corporate action (including any stockholder vote or other
action) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming due

 



      
 

 



 

authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company and due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement by Merger Sub,
constitutes (or will constitute, as the case may be) a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, the execution of
the Joinder Agreement by Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub
of the Transactions and the performance or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub
with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will not (i) conflict with or
violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other

representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its

independent investigation of the business, operations, assets and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination
to proceed with the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their

estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain and business and strategic plan information, regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, as well as in such business and strategic plans,
with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Parent and
Merger Sub have not relied on such information and will have no claim against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, with respect thereto or any rights hereunder with respect
thereto, except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement, including on
account of a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements expressly set forth herein.

 



 

SECTION 4.09. _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to

Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or
given to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or warranty with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or any Affiliates thereof for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement.

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, to
the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date of this Agreement,
there is no (a) pending or threatened Action against Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates or (b) Judgment imposed upon or affecting Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates, in each case, by or before any
Governmental Authority.

 



 

SECTION 4.11. _Ownership of Company Common Stock._ None of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been at any
time during the last three years, an "interested stockholder" of the Company

quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section

(i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of
Persons making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof or to request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be
made in writing and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Proposal and the failure to take the following actions
is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company and any of its Representatives may (x)
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of
Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement information (including non-public information) with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons

respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto,
and

 



      
 

 



 

including by providing copies of any revised or new documents evidencing or
delivered in connection with such Takeover Proposal). For the avoidance of
doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02(c)
will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means (x) any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date
of this Agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are not less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or otherwise restrict the
making of or amendment or modification to Takeover Proposals, or (y) any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, it
being understood that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled
to waive or release any preexisting explicit or implicit standstill provisions

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withhold (in the case of the Board of Directors of the Company)
or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withhold (in the case of the Board of Directors of the Company) or withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation,
(B) in the case of the Board of Directors of the Company, if any Takeover
Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Companys
stockholders within ten (10) business days of commencement thereof pursuant to
Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (C) recommend the approval or adoption of,
or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any
Takeover Proposal (it being understood that the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof may make or cause the Company to (x) make a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication, may elect to take no position
with respect to a Takeover Proposal until the close of business on the tenth
business day after the commencement of such Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act without such action in and of itself being
considered an adverse modification and (y) disclose that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has determined that a
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, that the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement and in each case any material
facts and circumstances relating thereto) (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
authorize, execute or enter into (or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement relating to a Takeover Proposal, other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, but not after, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof may (I) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause
the Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 5.02 and
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), in either case

 



      
 

 



 

if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x)
in the case of clause (I) where the Adverse Recommendation Change is not made
in response to a Takeover Proposal, failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) in the case of (A) clause (I) where such Adverse
Recommendation Change is made in response to a Takeover Proposal or (B) clause
(II), such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure
to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall not,
and shall cause the Company not to, take any action set forth in clause (I) or
clause (II), unless (1) the Company has given Parent at least five calendar
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor and, if relating to a Takeover Proposal,
include an unredacted copy of any such Superior Proposal and an unredacted
copy of any relevant proposed transaction agreements, the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof), (2) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (or, if the
action set forth in clause (I) does not relate to a Takeover Proposal, such
that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would not reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law) and (3) following the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith such binding
offer, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in clause (I) does
not relate to a Takeover Proposal, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would continue to be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law) if the
revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect (it being
understood that in the event of any change to the financial terms or any other
material terms of any such Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in
clause (I) does not relate to a Takeover Proposal, any material change to the
underlying relevant facts and circumstances), this proviso shall again apply
(but the five calendar day period shall instead be two calendar days); and
_provided_ _further_ that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the
termination is in accordance with Section 7.01 and, the Company pays Parent
the applicable Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.03 prior
to or concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject to
the provisions of _Section 5.02(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition of more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company), including through the acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Company owning such assets, (ii) acquisition of more than 25% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or voting power of the Company, (iii) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or
group beneficially owning more than 25% of the outstanding Company Common
Stock or voting power of the Company or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which such Person or
group (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) or more than 25% of the
aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving the
Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity, in each case, other than the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Agreement and the Transactions shall not be deemed a
Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in its good faith judgment after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Transactions and (ii) is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account all legal, regulatory, financial, timing, financing and other aspects
of such proposal and of this Agreement; _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "25%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action,
another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to promptly
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make

(iv), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in _Sections
5.03(c)_ and _(d)_ below. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means
the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, all applicable foreign antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees: (1) to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions within 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, (2) to
make the appropriate filings under the Other Required Antitrust Laws as

all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain
all consents under any such Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign
or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with
competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take all
actions necessary to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or any such Other Required Antitrust Law and
resolve any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under the
Federal Trade Commission Act or any other applicable Law raised by any
Governmental Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, any Restraint that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
Transactions, including (i) agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise convey or
hold separate any particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the
Effective Time, (ii) permitting the Company to sell, divest or otherwise
convey or hold separate any of the particular assets or categories of assets

existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, (iv) terminating any joint venture or other arrangement of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (v) creating any relationship, contractual
right or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or, in each case,
entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by, or
filing appropriate applications with, the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing
and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company, by consenting
to such action by the Company (including any consents required under this
Agreement with respect to such action) (each of the actions described in
clauses (i) \- (v), a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ that
in no event shall anything in this Agreement require, or be construed to
require, the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to (1)
take, or agree to take, any Divestiture Action unless all Divestiture Actions
collectively would not result in a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, assets or financial condition of a company the size of
(and with results of operations equal to those of) the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to the Effective Time or (2) take any
actions, including the actions described in clauses (i) \- (v) above with
respect to Parent, its Affiliates or their respective assets, categories of
assets, businesses, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or
arrangements. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.03(c)_, the Company shall enter into one or more agreements
requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing
(but conditioned upon consummation of the Closing) with respect to any
Divestiture Action. Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as
reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and
any of their respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the
intention to, or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the
obtaining of approval of the DOJ or FTC or under any Other Required Antitrust
Laws. Nothing in this Agreement (x) shall require any party to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations in connection
with obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under, or any approvals under, the HSR Act or Other Required Antitrust Laws or
approvals from any other Governmental Authorities, unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing or (y) shall require
Parent or its Affiliates to (and neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall without the express written consent of Parent) defend through litigation
any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person
(including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would prevent the Closing prior to
the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission

 



       
 

 



 

with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by
a private person, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Authority (including any "4(c) documents" and "4(d)
documents" as these terms are used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act) and of any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions and (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other
parties hereto with respect to information relating to the other parties
hereto and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; _provided_
that any such information or materials referred to in (i) \- (iii) may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
(y) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall,
following consultation with the Company and after giving due consideration to
its views and acting reasonably and in good faith, direct and control all
aspects of the parties efforts to gain regulatory clearance either before any
Governmental Authority or in any action brought to enjoin the Transactions
pursuant to any Antitrust Laws.

 



 

SECTION 5.04. _Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with, Section
5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the "
_Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Section 5.04 shall not
apply to any press release or other public statement made by the Company or
Parent (a) which is consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this
Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the Company or the
Transactions that has not been previously announced or made public in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04 or (b) is made in the ordinary
course of business and does not relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.05. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Law, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records (other than any of the foregoing that relate to the

 



      
 

 



 

negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or, subject to Section 5.02, to
any Takeover Proposal or any other transactions potentially competing with or
alternative to the Transactions or proposals from other parties relating to
any competing or alternative transactions) and the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent and Parents Representatives such information concerning
its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company; _provided further_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing
so is reasonably likely to (i) violate applicable Law or an applicable
Judgment, (ii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection or other legal privilege or (iii) expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. In any such event, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way
that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk
waiver of such privilege or protection or risk such liability, including
entering into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other
similar arrangement. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 5.05 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person
designated by the Company. Until the Effective Time, all information provided
will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement dated as of January 5,
2016 by and among the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
").

 



 

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance._ (a) From and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in each case to the fullest extent
permissible by applicable Law, (i) jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to
the Effective Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses
of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director
or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary, (B) the fact that an Indemnitee
is or was a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary, (C) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitees capacity as a director or officer of the Company or such
Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary or (D)
acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director,
partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company or taken at
the request of such corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise , in each case under clauses (A), (B), (C) or
(D), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action
relating in whole or in part to the

 



      
 

 



 

Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee) and (ii) assume (in
the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further
action) all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or in any agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement
providing for indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities
of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the
date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, without requiring a preliminary determination of entitlement to
indemnification, advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses
of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.06 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.06) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that
such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.06(a)
or applicable Law.

 



 

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.06 (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought
by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim
and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Indemnitees
who are currently (and any additional Indemnitees who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable in the aggregate to such individuals than those of
such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_ , that if the aggregate
annual premium for such insurance exceeds 300% of the annual premium for such
insurance as of the date hereof (the " _Premium Cap_ "), then the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall cause to be provided a policy covering such
individuals with the best coverage as is then available at a cost up to but
not exceeding such Premium Cap. The Company may (or if requested by Parent,
the Company shall), in consultation with Parent, purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing at least substantially equivalent benefits in the aggregate as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions, at
an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the aggregate maximum amount payable
pursuant to the proviso above for such six year period. If such prepaid "tail
policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.06(c) and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
honor all of its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this Section 5.06 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.06).

 



 

(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent or any of its
successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.06.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section
5.06 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Claim (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an
Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the full and
final resolution of such Claim.

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters._ (a) Subject to any applicable Labor
Agreements, until December 31, 2017 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (i) base salary
and annual cash bonus opportunities to each person who is an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") that are no less favorable, in each case,
than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance
benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those
that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable
severance benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements as in
effect on the date hereof and (iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements
(other than base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive opportunities,
severance benefits and employee stock purchase plan benefits) to Continuing
Employees that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the
case of clauses (i) and (iii), except to the extent such Continuing Employees
employment with Parent or its Affiliates is terminated prior to the end of the
Continuation Period. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide a 2017 long-term incentive award to each Continuing
Employee employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries at the time annual long-term
awards are made generally that is no less favorable than the greater of (A)
the long-term incentive award made to similarly situated employees of Parent
generally or (B) the ordinary course long-term incentive award made by the
Company to such employee for 2016, as adjusted in a manner consistent with
Parents long-term plan for the performance of the Surviving Corporations
business operations relative to peer group companies.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor in accordance with their terms all the Company Plans as in effect at the
Effective Time, it being understood that the foregoing shall not limit the
right of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
amend any Company Plan in accordance with its terms. Parent hereby
acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions constitutes a "change
in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes
of any Company Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or
"change of control" (or a term of similar import), as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes (except as set forth below), including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals,
each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer
of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving
Corporation, its successors and assigns); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for
any purpose under any defined benefit retirement plan, retiree welfare plan,
equity-based incentive plan or long-term incentive plan, (iii) to the extent
not recognized by the Company for similar purposes, or (iv) for purposes of
any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y)
that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to
the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.08 (i) is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise,
(ii) obligates Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to retain the employment of any particular employee of the

_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in Section 5.13 or this Section 5.15
shall require such cooperation or other action on the part of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the extent it would (A)
unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of the

of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with
the Financing pursuant to this Section 5.15(a), and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to (x) any information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (y) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct by any such Persons.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the
Effective Time of all

 



      
 

 



 

commitments in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the repayment in
full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness
thereunder, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing such
indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent at least two (2) business
days prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff letter with respect to the
Senior Secured Credit Facility (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance

purchase and/or consent solicitations with respect to all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes on the terms and conditions
specified by Parent and in compliance with all applicable terms and conditions
of the Notes (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offer until Parent shall
have provided the Company with drafts and the final form of the necessary
offer to purchase, consent solicitation statement, related letter of
transmittal, supplemental indenture and other related documents, in each case,
as applicable in connection with such Debt Offer and all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (collectively, the " _Debt Offer
Documents_"); _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) Parent will consult with the
Company regarding the timing and commencement of the Debt Offers and any early
tender or early consent deadlines for the Debt Offers in light of the regular

Law and (B) the Debt Offers need not commence prior to the later of (x) ten
(10) business days after the date the preliminary Proxy Statement is first
filed with the SEC and (y) the date the staff of the SEC indicates to the
Company that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
consult with the Company and afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review the material terms and conditions of the Debt Offers. The terms and
conditions specified by Parent for the Debt Offers shall be only such terms
and conditions as are customarily included in offers to purchase debt
securities similar to the Notes and in similar situations and shall otherwise
be in compliance with all applicable Laws and the terms and conditions of the
Notes. The closing of any such Debt Offer shall be expressly

 



       
 

 



 

conditioned on the Closing, and any such Debt Offer shall be conducted in
compliance with applicable Law, including SEC rules and regulations. None of
the Notes shall be required to be purchased, whether or not such repurchase is
at the option of the Company or at the request of Parent, prior to the Closing
Date. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause their
respective Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers. In addition, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent such
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with any other approach (an " _Other Debt Transaction_
") chosen by Parent to the defeasance, satisfaction and discharge, repayment,
repurchase, redemption, amendment or other treatment of any of the Notes in
connection with the Transactions; _provided_ , that (1) such cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (2) the closing of any such Other Debt Transaction shall be
expressly conditioned on the Closing, (3) such Other Debt Transaction shall be
conducted in compliance with applicable Law, including SEC rules and
regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Notes and (4) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any payment with
respect to such Other Debt Transaction prior to the Closing Date. Parent and
Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause their
respective Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the Debt Offers and Other Debt
Transactions.

 



 

(ii) Following the commencement of the Debt Offers, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, make any change to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offers, unless such change is previously approved by
Parent in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or
required by applicable Law or the terms and conditions of the Notes. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Closing shall have occurred
and that there shall be no Law, injunction or other legal restraint
prohibiting such waiver or consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent of
Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers other than as agreed in writing
between Parent and the Company.

 



 

(iii) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent
solicitation expiration date associated with any Debt Offer, assuming the
requisite consents are received, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries as is necessary, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable trustee, to execute supplemental indentures to
the Existing Note Indentures for which the requisite consent has been
received, which supplemental indentures shall (x) implement the amendments, if
any, described in the Debt Offer Documents, (y) become operative only
concurrently with the Effective Time and (z) be in compliance with applicable
Law and the terms and conditions

 



      
 

 



 

of the Notes. The Company shall, upon receipt of a written request from Parent
and on the date specified in such written request (which date shall not be
earlier than the Closing Date), accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay
for the Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Debt Offers in compliance with applicable Law and the terms
and conditions of the Notes and in accordance with the Debt Offers provided by
or at the direction of Parent, so long as Parent shall have complied with its
obligations under the next succeeding sentence. Parent hereby covenants and
agrees to provide (or cause to be provided) immediately available funds to the
Company for the full payment on the date specified in the written request
described in the preceding sentence of all Notes properly tendered and not
properly withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Offers and for the payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith.
The Company shall pay any consent fee in respect of any Debt Offers at the
times and pursuant to the terms of such Debt Offers and in compliance with
applicable Law and the terms and conditions of the Notes, provided that Parent
has provided (or caused to be provided) to the Company immediately available
funds for the full payment of such amounts on the applicable date and for the
payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith. Parent and Merger
Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause their
respective Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the entry into the supplemental
indentures and the acceptance for payment and payment of the Notes.

Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all
other communications with the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt
Offers (including, without limitation, any materials provided or filed
pursuant to the next succeeding sentence) shall be subject to prior review of,
and comment by, Parent and the Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to
each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers, any
information should be discovered by the Company or Parent that either the
Company or Parent reasonably believes should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall
be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the
applicable Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report
on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.15(c)(iv), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act, to the
extent applicable, and any other applicable Laws to the extent such Laws are
applicable in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be
deemed a breach of this Section 5.15.

 



 

(v) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more dealer
managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in
connection therewith, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, enter into customary agreements with such parties so selected;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise
incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with such parties so selected.

 



 

(vi) Subject to the compliance by Parent with its obligations under the last
sentence of this Section 5.15(c)(vi), if requested by Parent in writing, in
lieu of or in addition to commencing or consummating a Debt Offer for any
series of Notes, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time, issue a notice of
optional redemption (or in the case of any series of Notes that permit the
issuance of a conditional redemption notice, prior to the Effective Time but
conditioned thereupon) for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of such series of Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the
applicable Existing Note Indenture and in compliance with all applicable Laws
and (ii) take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate
the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the
applicable Existing Note Indenture and in compliance with all applicable Laws.
The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant
to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_ "
of such series of Notes. Subject to the compliance by Parent with its
obligations under the last sentence of this Section 5.15(c)(vi), the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause their respective
Representatives to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Discharge of any series of Notes identified to the Company
by Parent in writing at any time in compliance with all applicable Laws and
the terms and conditions of the Notes. Concurrently with the Closing, Parent
shall, or shall cause to be, deposited with the trustee under the applicable
Existing Note Indenture sufficient funds to effect (in compliance with the
provisions of such applicable Existing Note Indenture) any such Discharge

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Section 5.15(c)(vi). Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause their respective
Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by
the Company in connection with the Discharge of any series of Notes.

 



 

(vii) Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Offers and any Other Debt Transaction upon the incurrence of
such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses in connection with the Debt Offers, the
Discharge of any series of Notes and any Other Debt Transaction promptly
following the incurrence thereof. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Offers,
the Discharge of any series of Notes, any Other Debt Transaction and any other
transactions taken pursuant to this Section 5.15 or any information utilized
in connection therewith, except with respect to (x) any information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such Persons. For the avoidance
of doubt, all information provided to Parent by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.15
will be kept confidential pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

stockholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be reasonably requested by
the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and

of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
and shall supply Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the

reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any
such comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response, which the Company shall
consider in good faith.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 5.16(a) and notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall take all necessary actions in accordance with

Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement, and, prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, shall not submit any Takeover
Proposal for approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company. Subject
to Section 5.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn,
recess, or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) after consultation

Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the

twelve-month period); _provided_ that, for purposes of clauses (A) and (B) of

 _Miscellaneous_

 



 

SECTION 8.01. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any document or
instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or

delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by its terms
applies in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement._ Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the parties
hereto;

 



       
 

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that following receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which
by Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such approval. Any amendment or supplement to this Agreement shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

 



 

SECTION 8.03. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (b)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
other party or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained herein applicable to such party or, except as otherwise
provided herein, waive any of such partys conditions (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the
foregoing); _provided_ , _however_ , that following receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, there shall be no waiver or extension of this Agreement
that decreases the Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights
of the stockholders of the Company without such approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

SECTION 8.04. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

 



 

SECTION 8.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto.

 



 

SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Letter, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration; (ii) if the
Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

occurs, the right of the holders of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs to
receive such amounts as provided for in Section 2.03; (iii) if the Effective
Time occurs, the rights of the Indemnitees set forth in Section 5.06 of this
Agreement and (iv) the rights of the Company Related Parties set forth in

which are intended for the benefit of the Lender Related Parties.

 



 

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction._ (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within that State, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over any Action, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of
an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section
8.07(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon
such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
Section 8.10 of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

 



 

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the
following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 8.07(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and
without that right neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

 



      
 

 



 

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Outside
Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case, in accordance with
Section 8.08, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action, as the case may be.

 



 

SECTION 8.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
