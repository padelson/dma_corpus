obligations under the Assumed Contracts (collectively, the "Payables") shall
be prorated between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
effective as of the Effective Time with Seller being responsible for all
Payables related to the period prior to but excluding the Closing Date and
Buyer being responsible for all Payables related to the period on and after
the Closing Date. At Closing, the Net Working Capital shall be (A) increased
by the pro-rated amount of all such Payables made by Seller prior to Closing
that are attributable to Buyer's period of ownership of the Purchased Assets,
and (B) decreased by an amount equal to the pro-rated amount of any such
payment obligations assumed by Buyer that are attributable to Seller's period
of ownership of the Purchased Assets. The parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause utility meter readings to be determined as of the
Effective Time or as close thereto as reasonably practicable; provided,
however, that if a party's proration for a particular amount owed under this
Section 2.4(a)(i) cannot be determined due to the unavailability of the
necessary information on the appropriate invoice or remittance statement, then
the proration shall be calculated on a per day basis using the number of days
in the respective party's period of ownership of the Purchased Assets. In
determining whether a payment to a third party pursuant to any Assumed
Contract is attributable to Buyer's period of ownership or the Seller's period
of ownership, the parties will allocate the burden of such payment in a manner
that reflects the relative benefit of such work performed, services provided
or goods delivered to each party; provided, however, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that any work performed, services provided or goods
delivered prior to the Closing Date are for the benefit of Seller, and any
work performed, services provided or goods delivered on or after the Closing
Date are for the benefit of Buyer.

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIf Buyer receives any funds or other property that
belongs to Seller, or vice versa, then the receiving party shall hold such
funds and property in trust for the benefit of the rightful party and shall
promptly forward such funds or property to the rightful party. It is the
intention of the parties that Seller shall receive all income, rentals, fees
and other revenues (including any under Assumed Contracts) attributable to
Seller's period of ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets, and Buyer
shall receive all income, rentals, fees and other  \t\t

  \t\t

   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

revenues (including any under Assumed Contracts) attributable to Buyer's
period of ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.5 \t\t\tPurchase Price Allocation. As promptly as practicable,
but not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall
exchange their respective schedules allocating the Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent taken into account under Section 1060 of
the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (as to each of Buyer and the Seller, the "Allocation"). Buyer and Seller
will make reasonable efforts to agree their respective Allocations for
purposes of the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including the
filing for Form 8594); provided, however, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Buyer and Seller to agree to a common Allocation.

jurisdiction (other than the jurisdiction in which it is organized) in which
it carries on its business or owns, leases or subleases property, except where

the other transaction documents or the Closing; (iv) trigger the right of any
Person to acquire all or any part of the Purchased Assets or any interest or

contained in the deed therefor describe such Owned Land correctly in all
material respects. Seller has delivered true, complete and correct copies of
all leases of Leased Real Property to Buyer.

 \t\t\t\t 4.8 \t\t\tIntellectual Property. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSchedule 4.8 sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all Plant Specific Intellectual Property as well as any other Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by the Seller and used in the
Business. Seller owns all right, title and interest in all Plant Specific
Intellectual Property that is not licensed pursuant to an Assumed Contract.
Seller owns or has a defensible right to use all Plant Specific Intellectual
Property described in Schedule 4.8, but Buyer acknowledges that Seller's
defensible right to use certain Intellectual Property and know-how material
other than the Plant Specific Intellectual Property to conduct the Business as
it is currently conducted by Seller is based in part upon licenses granted to
Seller set forth in the Excluded Contracts listed in Schedule 1.2(c), which
licenses are not transferred as part of this Agreement, and Seller makes no
representation or warranty that Buyer can use any Intellectual Property other
than the Plant Specific Intellectual Property without the licenses granted to
Seller set forth in the Excluded Contracts listed in Schedule 1.2(c). Except
for claims received by the Seller that resulted in licenses referenced in the
Excluded Contracts set forth in Schedule 1.2(c), Seller has not received
written notice that its right to use the know-how and trade secrets material
and other Intellectual Property used in the Business to conduct the Business
as it is currently conducted is not valid or infringes any third party's
Intellectual Property or rights. To the Seller's Knowledge, no use or
possession by the Seller of any Plant Specific Intellectual Property or the
operation of the Business has infringed or does infringe the Intellectual
Property or other rights of any party or constitute unfair competition. The
Plant Specific Intellectual Property used by the Seller, along with the
Intellectual Property licensed to Seller in the Excluded Contracts set forth
in Schedule 1.2(c), is sufficient Intellectual Property for the operation of
the Business as it is currently conducted. To the extent Seller uses Plant
Specific Intellectual Property licensed from a third party in the operation of
the Business as it is currently conducted, Seller has used reasonable, good
faith efforts, which efforts may include, but are not limited to, seeking
warranties of ownership or the right to license or provide such Plant Specific
Intellectual Property, or an indemnification by such third party against
infringement arising from the possession or use of such licensed Plant
Specific Intellectual Property by Seller, to obtain verification that the
party providing or licensing such Plant Specific Intellectual Property has the
right to so provide or license such Plant Specific Intellectual Property. The
Seller complies in all material respects with the terms, conditions and
obligations contained in any Contracts or licenses conveying or granting the
Seller rights to use, modify, sell or license Plant Specific Intellectual
Property. To the Seller's Knowledge, no actions by any third party infringe
upon any of the Seller-owned Plant Specific Intellectual Property described in
Schedule 1.1(g). The Plant Specific Intellectual Property will be available
for use by Buyer and its Affiliates immediately after the Closing Date on the
same terms as those under which the Seller owned or used the Plant Specific
Intellectual Property prior to the Closing Date and without requiring any
additional payment or consideration by Buyer. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tAll applicable fees, royalties and payments relating to
the Plant Specific Intellectual Property due and payable by Seller or its
Affiliates to any licensors of such Plant Specific Intellectual Property have
been paid (and are not in any grace or extension period).

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tSchedule 4.8 sets forth a complete and accurate list and
summary description of all Net Names registered with a domain name registrar.
To the Seller's Knowledge, no Net Name has been or is now involved in any
dispute, opposition, invalidation or cancellation proceeding and no such
action is threatened with respect to any Net Name. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Seller owns or has a valid and defensible right to
use the manuals, policies, procedures, customer lists, personal information or
other data, information and documents that are material to or used in the
operation of the Business as it is currently conducted.

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ix) \t\t\tagree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

employees, customers and vendors as the Buyer may reasonably request, and the

Purchased Assets which may have been compiled and submitted by members of the
Seller Group and information concerning the properties of the Business. The
Seller shall only be required to provide such access and furnish such
information to the extent that it would not violate applicable Laws. The Buyer
will treat any such information in accordance with the provisions of the

right prior to Closing, along with the Seller to inspect and verify the
inventory of Spares to confirm it is accurate in all material respects. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.4 \t\t\tConditions and Closing. The Seller shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.1 and 9.2 to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions

thereof. Subject to the satisfaction of all other conditions at the Closing,
the Seller shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered)
all agreements and documents relating to the Seller as set forth in Section
9.2. The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to
not take any action, or enter into any transaction, that would cause any of
the Seller's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate or result in a breach of any covenant made by it in this
Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.5 \t\t\tApprovals and Consents of Third Parties. The Seller has
indicated (i) on Schedule 4.3(b) Part 1, the consents that will be required to
be obtained by the Seller from any Third Party (other than a Governmental
Authority) prior to the Closing, (ii) on Schedule 4.3(b) Part 2, the consents
that Seller will use reasonable, good faith efforts to obtain from any Third
Party (other than a Governmental Authority) prior to the Closing (each, as so
indicated, a "Required Consent"). Consistent with Section 1.5, the Seller
shall use its reasonable, good faith efforts to obtain all Required Consents,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, prior to the
Closing and will cooperate with the Buyer to obtain any approvals and consents
required to be obtained by the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting the Purchased
Assets as a condition for obtaining any Required Consent except with the prior
written consent of the Buyer. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.6 \t\t\tNotification of Changes. Seller will promptly advise the
Buyer in writing of (i) any event occurring or not occurring subsequent to the
date of this Agreement but before the Closing Date that is reasonably likely
to (a) render any representation or warranty of the Seller contained in
Article IV untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) cause any
covenant, condition or agreement of the Seller contained in this Agreement not
to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any Proceeding
that is threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Seller that
would have been listed in Schedule 4.11 if such Proceeding had arisen prior to
the date hereof, (iii) any notice or other communication from any Third Party
alleging that the consent of such Third Party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any
material default under any Material Contract or event that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would become such a default on or prior to the Closing
Date.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.7 \t\t\tSupplement to Disclosure Schedules. Until the seventh
(7th) Business Day prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to supplement or amend the disclosure schedules relating to
Article IV hereto solely with respect to any matter first arising after the
Effective Date (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Any disclosure in any such
Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained
in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 9.2 have been satisfied; provided, however, that if Buyer has the
right to, but does not elect to, terminate this Agreement within ten (10)
Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with
respect to such matter and, further, shall have irrevocably waived its right
to indemnification under Section 10.2 with respect to such supplement or
amendment set forth in the Schedule Supplement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.8 \t\t\tGovernmental Approvals. During the period prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable, good faith
efforts and cooperate with the Buyer in attempting to obtain any consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities required to be obtained by them in order
to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or to otherwise satisfy the conditions in Article IX; provided, that the
Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting the Purchased
Assets as a condition for obtaining any such consents or approvals except with
the prior written consent of the Buyer. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.9 \t\t\tRelease of Liens. The Seller shall on or prior to the
Closing Date deliver to the Buyer such documents as are necessary to terminate
and release all Liens on the Purchased Assets except for Permitted Liens,
which documents shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Buyer and
shall include without limitation, all documents necessary to terminate of
record any such Liens. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.10 \t\t\tCarve-Out Tracts. Schedule 6.10 sets forth a list of
land, tanks and other improvements that Seller previously transferred or
conveyed to one or more of Seller's Affiliates and are used in connection with
or necessary for the operation of the Business (the "Carve-Out Tracts"). Prior
to Closing, Seller agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to re-acquire good
and marketable title to the Carve-Out Tracts free and clear of all Liens
except for the Permitted Liens for use in the operation of the Business, and
such Carve-Out Tracts shall be included in the Purchased Assets to be sold to
Buyer hereunder. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.11 \t\t\tShipment of Stored Grain. Within 90 days following the
Effective Date, Seller shall have sold and shipped all grain from the grain
storage bins that is owned by Seller as of the Effective Date (the "Stored
Grain"). Buyer will provide labor to load out the Stored Grain onto trucks
and rail cars supplied by Seller in a good and workmanlike manner in
compliance with applicable Laws and Orders and generally accepted industry
standards. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tBuyer will not be responsible for the current or future
quality or quantity of the Stored Grain. As the parties have agreed that the
quality of the Stored Grain is all sample grade quality, Buyer will collect
samples from each shipment from the facility, but will not be responsible for
grading of any of the Stored Grain. Buyer will send samples of the Stored
Grain to a grain grading facility of Seller's choice and expense. Buyer will
permit Seller or its  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t29  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

designated consultant, contractor or subcontractor to be present to observe
the removal of the Stored Grain. Seller shall assume, retain and be
responsible for and pay and discharge any and all Liabilities arising from the
removal and disposal of the Stored Grain as described herein. If equipment is
required to remove the Stored Grain as provided herein, Seller shall be
responsible for all expense involved in providing all equipment and all
operating cost thereof. Buyer will load Stored Grain at the direction of
Seller and will not be responsible for acquiring or coordinating any
transportation for the Stored Grain, or any expense in connection therewith. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tAll Stored Grain remaining at the Ethanol Plant at the
end of 120 days after the Effective Date will be charged for storage at the
rate of $0.005 per bushel per day and a load out fee of $0.15 per bushel.
Seller will maintain content insurance on all Stored Grain at the facility.
As Buyer is not a commercial grain company, it does not have a commercial
grain license or commercial grain storage. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.12 \t\t\tRFS Third Party Engineering Audit. Seller agrees to
work with Buyer to complete the EPA requirement for a third party engineering
audit using quality assurance plans due January 30, 2022 and covering the last
three years of Seller's RIN generation and plant operating data. In addition,
Seller agrees to certify to the data covering Seller's operations and RIN
generation prior to Closing. If any RINs are found to be invalidly generated
or otherwise need to be replaced, Seller shall be the responsible party for
doing so at its sole cost and expense.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.13 \t\t\tRail Cars. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSeller agrees to transfer or cause its Affiliates to
transfer to Buyer up to the number and types of railcars listed in Schedule
6.13(a). These railcars are leased by Seller and/or its Affiliates pursuant to
various railcar leases and agreements with respect thereto ("Rail Car
Agreements"). Seller has provided to Buyer copies of the applicable Rail Car
Agreements, along with the lease rates and other fees that the counterparty of
each Rail Car Agreement is currently charging Seller or its applicable
Affiliates for the railcars that are the subject of the Rail Car Agreements
(the "Lease Rates"). Seller and Buyer further agree to the terms set forth in
Exhibit G and Schedule 6.13(c). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tBeginning promptly after Closing, Seller will coordinate
with Buyer to schedule railcars from Seller's or its Affiliates' fleet into
the Ethanol Plant as needed in the ordinary course of business, and as such
cars come into the Ethanol Plant they will be identified by Buyer as railcars
to be assigned or subleased to Buyer ("Qualifying Rail Cars"), until such time
as all Qualifying Rail Cars have been identified. Only railcars that are in
serviceable condition when they arrive at the Ethanol Plant will be used as
Qualifying Rail Cars. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate terms of an inspection
program for the Qualifying Rail Cars such that a baseline condition for each
car is documented and Buyer is not liable for any damage or mechanical failure
conditions that existed prior to Closing. As Qualifying Rail Cars are
identified, Seller or its appropriate Affiliates and Buyer shall deliver to
the counterparty of each Rail Car Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars
a letter: (i) requesting the assignment of the Rail Car Agreement covering
such Qualifying Rail Cars from Seller or its respective Affiliate to Buyer, or
(ii) requesting the release of such Qualifying Rail Cars under the applicable
Rail Car Agreement, and the further lease by such counterparty to Buyer of
such Qualifying Rail Cars. Once a Qualifying Rail Car becomes fully assigned
to the Buyer, it will become a "Buyer Rail  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t30  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Car". Should the counterparty of any Rail Car Agreement refuse to consent to
the assignment of Qualifying Railcars to Buyer, Seller will use reasonable
efforts to provide substitute Qualifying Rail Cars. In no event shall Buyer or
Seller be obligated to include Rail Cars for which the counterparty to the
Rail Car Agreement seeks to modify the original terms so as to negatively
impact either party. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTo account for any difference between fair market rates
and Lease Rates Seller and Buyer agree to true-up (as part of the Net Working
Capital adjustment in Section 2.3) the difference between (i) sum of the
present values of the product of the monthly Lease Rate multiplied by the
number of railcars that are Qualifying Rail Cars for each month remaining on
the term of the Rail Car Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars (the
"Lease Charge"); and (ii) the sum of present values of the product of the
applicable fair market rate listed on Schedule 6.13(c) for similarly situated
railcars (the "Market Rates") multiplied by the number of railcars that are
Qualifying Rail Cars for each month remaining on the term of the Rail Car
Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars (the "Market Charge"). If the
Lease Charge is less than the Market Charge, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount of the difference between the Lease Charge and the Market Charge as
part of the Working Capital adjustment in Section 2.3(d) hereof. If the Lease
Charge is greater than the Market Charge, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount
of the difference between the Lease Charge and the Market Charge as part of
the Working Capital adjustment in Section 2.3(d) hereof. The annual discount
rate to be used in determining the present value factor for the Market Charge
and Lease Charge shall be equal to five percent (5%). The discount period for
each monthly calculation will be from the middle of each month to the Closing
Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tUntil such time as the parties complete the paperwork
and secure the necessary counterparty consents to complete the assignment of
the Qualifying Rail Cars to the Buyer, Seller shall, or shall cause their
Affiliates to, allow Buyer to use the Qualifying Rail Cars on a temporary
subleased basis (the "Loaned Cars") such that, at any time, the total number
and types of Buyer Rail Cars and Loaned Cars equals the number and types
identified as Qualifying Rail Cars. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all lease
payments and other associated costs, payments or fees (including repair and
maintenance costs) arising under the applicable Rail Car Agreements with
respect to the use by Buyer of the related Loaned Cars. Buyer may elect to
discontinue the use of any Loaned Car by written notice to Seller, in which
case, upon return of such Loaned Car to Seller, Buyer shall no longer be
responsible for any payments, costs or fees related thereto, and Seller shall
not be responsible for providing a replacement Loaned Car. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that Seller may substitute other equivalent railcars for Loaned
Cars, so long as the substituted railcars meet the criteria to be Qualifying
Rail Cars. The parties hereto agree to (or to cause their applicable
Affiliates to) work together in a commercially reasonable manner to manage the
transition of the Loaned Cars hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith a sublease agreement that would further define terms of the Loaned
Cars. Such sublease agreement may also account for the temporary use by Buyer
of additional railcars that are not Qualifying Rail Cars. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Seller's sole obligations under this Agreement with respect to
Required Consents necessary for the assignment to Buyer of the Qualifying Rail
Cars shall be the delivery by Seller to the counterparties thereto of the
letters described in Section 6.13(c) above and Seller's joinder in the
execution of any  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t31  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

documentation reasonably and customarily required by the counterparties to
effectuate or otherwise document such assignments. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Seller shall not be required to provide any
guarantees or other credit enhancement that may be necessary in order for
Buyer to secure the necessary consent for the assignment of the Rail Car
Agreements or for Buyer to secure its own railcar leases. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperatively endeavor to complete the assignment of all Qualifying Rail
Cars (including any substitutes therefor made in accordance with the
provisions of Section 6.13(b) as promptly as reasonably possible after
Closing, but in all events within three (3) months after Closing. Seller shall
not be obligated to provide any Loaned Cars more than six (6) months following
Closing, unless and only to the extent that Buyers' failure to complete the
assignment of all Qualifying Railcars (and substitutes therefor, as
applicable) is the result of Seller's failure to comply with its obligations
under this Section 6.13. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tBuyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees against any and all Losses arising from the use or misuse
after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates of the Loaned Cars pursuant to
this Section 6.13. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 6.14 \t\t\tConfidentiality and Confidential Information. Each
party will maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except that Buyer and Seller may disclose the
terms hereof to their employees with a need to know and to their legal,
accounting, financing or other advisors and potential or actual lenders and/or
investors (provided such parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of such
information). All Confidential Information (as defined below) disclosed by one
party (or its employees, officers, agents or advisors) to another party (or
its employees, officers, agents or advisors) shall be treated by the receiving
party with the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of
care, as the receiving party uses with respect to its own similar information
to protect the Confidential Information of the disclosing party and to prevent
any (a) use of Confidential Information that is not contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) dissemination of Confidential Information to any employee of a
receiving party without a need to know, (c) communication of Confidential
Information to any third party (other than a receiving party's legal,
accounting, financing or other advisors and its potential or actual lenders
and/or investors) or (d) publication of Confidential Information. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" is Trade Secrets; financial
information and pricing; technical information, such as research, development,
procedures, algorithms, data, designs and know-how; business information, such
as strategies, operations, methods, planning, marketing interests and
products; the terms of this Agreement or any modification or amendment
thereto; and the proprietary or confidential information of any third party
who may disclose such information to a receiving party. The receiving party of
any Confidential Information will return or destroy (and confirm such
destruction to the other party) all such data and information to the
respective source promptly upon written request therefor in the event that
this Agreement is terminated. This Section imposes no obligation upon a
receiving party with respect to Confidential Information that (i) was
rightfully and lawfully known to the receiving party, free of any obligation
of confidentiality, as demonstrated by information in existence at the time of
disclosure; (ii) was independently developed by the receiving party without
relying on the disclosing party's Confidential Information; (iii) was part of
the public domain or has entered the public domain through no action or
inaction of the receiving party; (iv) was lawfully obtained by the receiving
party from a third party not under any obligation of confidentiality; or (v)
disclosed with the prior written approval of the disclosing party. If a  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t32  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

receiving party is required by a Governmental Authority to disclose
Confidential Information, the receiving party agrees to give the disclosing
party reasonable advance notice (unless prohibited by applicable Law) so that
the disclosing party may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order.
If, in the absence of a protective order, other legal remedy or the receipt of
a waiver by the disclosing party, the receiving party or any of its
representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of the receiving party's legal
counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information of the
disclosing party or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, the receiving party or its representative may, without liability
hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which
such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the
receiving party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information including, without limitation,
by cooperating with the disclosing party (at the disclosing party's expense)
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. Each
party acknowledges that the damages for improper disclosure of Confidential
Information may be irreparable; therefore, the injured party is entitled to
seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in
addition to all other remedies available at Law or in equity. Insofar as any
Confidential Information furnished to Buyer relates to the Ethanol Plant or
the Purchased Assets, Buyer will be released from its obligations under this
Section at the Effective Time, and thereafter Seller and its Affiliates shall
no longer possess any rights in or use of such Confidential Information.

this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 7.2 \t\t\tNotification of Changes. The Buyer will promptly advise
the Seller in writing of (i) any event occurring or not occurring subsequent

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t33  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Closing Date that is reasonably likely to (a) render any representation or

inaccurate in any material respect or (b) cause any covenant, condition or
agreement of the Buyer contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or
satisfied in all material respects and (ii) any notice or other communication

contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise satisfy the conditions in
Article IX. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 7.5 \t\t\tConfidentiality. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in

credit, bonds, security deposits, and other surety obligations and evidence of
financial capacity, in each case acceptable to the relevant beneficiary or
counterparty in replacement of those credit support arrangements set forth in

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller and its Affiliates to be
released, as of the Closing, from all obligations relating to the Credit
Support Arrangements and any Liabilities related thereto, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller. Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Seller in accordance with and subject to the limitations in
Article 10 from any and all Losses relating to, resulting from, or arising out
of, any Credit Support Arrangement to the extent any such Losses directly
relate to, result from, or arise out of the use of the Purchased Assets or the
operation of Business on or after the Closing Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.3 \t\t\tTitle Matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTitle Commitment and Survey. Seller shall (i) cause the
Title Company to issue, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this
Agreement, commitments (the "Title Commitments") for one or more Title
Policies to be issued by the Title Company with respect to  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t34  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

each parcel of Real Estate together with copies of all instruments identified
therein as creating exceptions or title defects (the "Exceptions") and (ii)
have prior the Effective Date delivered to Buyer copies of all existing
surveys, plats and site plans of the Real Estate in Seller's possession (the
"Existing Surveys"). Buyer shall have the right to within thirty (30) days
following the Effective Date, at its sole cost and expense, to cause the
Existing Surveys to be updated or obtain a new survey or surveys of the Real
Estate (the "Updated Survey" and together with the Existing Surveys, the
"Survey"). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tTitle Review. Buyer shall have the right to make
objections ("Title Objections") to any Exception or any reservation, easement,
covenant, exception, limitation, restriction or other defect shown on the
Updated Survey or reflected in the Title Commitment, such Title Objections to
be made in writing and delivered to Seller, the Title Company and Surveyor
within ten (10) days following the latter of Buyer's receipt of the Title
Commitments, the documents reflecting Exceptions, or the Updated Survey.
Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure (or cause to be
cured, including by way of express title insurance or its equivalent) any
Exceptions constituting Title Objections, such cure to be effected not later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Cure Period");
provided, however, that in the event a mortgage, deed of trust or other
similar monetary lien secured by the Real Estate and placed on the Real Estate
by or at the request of a Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (collectively a
"Mortgage Lien") affects all or any portion of the Seller's interest in the
Real Estate, on or before Closing, Seller shall cause all such Mortgage Liens
to be satisfied in a manner which is sufficient to cause them to no longer
affect title to the Real Estate, and the Real Estate shall be conveyed free
and clear of all such Mortgage Liens, and such Mortgage Liens shall in no
event constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a Permitted Lien. If Seller
elects not to, fail, or is unable for any other reason to cure any Exceptions
constituting Title Objections during the Cure Period, Buyer shall have the
right, within five (5) days following the expiration of the Cure Period and as
Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy in such event, to either (i) waive in
writing its Title Objections with respect to such Exceptions, or (ii)
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, it being understood that
the scheduled Closing Date shall be extended by five (5) days (or the lesser
number of days until Buyer waives the Title Objections, if applicable) to
accommodate Buyer's election. If Buyer fails to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence within the
required time period or otherwise consummates the Closing, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived all Title Objections which have not, as of such time,
been cured, and all Exceptions forming the basis for such uncured Title
Objections shall become Permitted Liens. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tEach Title Policy shall insure good and marketable fee
simple title to the Real Property for an amount determined by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion (subject to any limitations imposed on the Title Company
by applicable Law and underwriting requirements) but subject to Permitted
Liens, the Exceptions and the standard printed exceptions in the promulgated
Title Policy form. Provided that Seller and its Affiliates will not thereby
incur any Liabilities that are not otherwise expressly set forth in the other
provisions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in executing any documents reasonably requested by the Title Company which may
be necessary to issue the Title Policies, including providing any factually
true affidavit reasonably requested by the Title Company or Buyer to evidence
the payment or satisfaction of any Liens, the absence of unrecorded leases and
parties in possession, the absence of work that could give rise to mechanics'
or materialmens' or similar lien claims, the absence of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t35  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

option or other agreements that could form the basis of an encumbrance or
similar rights against the subject property, to evidence the payment of any
Taxes affecting the Real Property, or to evidence the satisfaction of any
other matter which Buyer may be required to establish in order to obtain the
Title Policy or any endorsement thereto in form satisfactory to Buyer. The
cost and expense of procuring and issuing the Title Commitments and the Title
Policy shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.4 \t\t\tTax Matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSales and Use Taxes. Seller and Buyer agree that all
state and local sales and use Taxes relating to the sale and conveyance of the
Purchased Assets shall be the Liability of Buyer, and shall be borne by Buyer
as follows: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAt Closing, Seller shall not collect from Buyer any
state and local sales and use Taxes. Rather, Buyer shall remit such Taxes
directly to the appropriate Governmental Authorities when such Taxes are due
and owing and Buyer shall provide proof of payment to Seller. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tPromptly following Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller
with an appropriate exemption certificate to establish the right to any
exemption from state and local sales and use Taxes and for any exemptions from
any other applicable state Tax. Buyer shall thereafter provide Seller with any
additional exemption certificates and other documentation as may be required
by the Governmental Authorities for such purpose. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer, including providing Buyer with reasonable access to
Seller's books, records and such other data as Buyer may reasonably request in
order to support all applicable sales Tax exemptions, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tIf any exemption claimed by Buyer is subsequently
denied by any Governmental Authority, and as a result a Seller is assessed
additional sales or use Taxes, then Buyer shall remit such Taxes directly to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities, or, in the event such Taxes are
remitted by Seller, Buyer shall reimburse Seller, or their assignees, for such
assessed Taxes, including interest and penalty. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tProperty Taxes. All real property, personal property, ad
valorem and other similar Taxes assessed on any of the Purchased Assets
("Property Taxes") in the Tax Period in which the Closing Date occurs shall be
prorated between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days of such Tax
Period before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the number
of days in such Tax Period on and after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing
Tax Period"). Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such
prorated Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period,
and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such prorated
Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. At
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the amount, if any, of
any such Property Taxes prepaid by Seller with respect to a Post-Closing Tax
Period, or (ii) decreased by the amount, if any, of any such Property Taxes
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period which Buyer will be obligated to pay
after Closing. If the Closing Date shall occur before the tax rate or
assessment is fixed for  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

such Tax year, the apportionment of such Property Taxes and payments at the
Closing shall be based upon the most recently ascertainable tax bills, with an
adjustment being made between Seller and Buyer when such Property Taxes and
the assessed valuation for the Tax year in which the Closing occurs are known.
Seller shall file all required Tax Returns with respect to Property Taxes that
become due and payable before the Closing Date in a manner consistent with
prior practice, except as required by applicable Legal Requirement, and shall
pay such Property Taxes on or before the due date therefor. Buyer shall file
all Tax Returns incidental to such Property Taxes that become due and payable
after Closing and shall pay such Property Taxes on or before the due date
therefor. To the extent that the amount of any such Property Taxes paid by
Buyer with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds the Purchase Price
adjustment therefor, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the difference within
thirty (30) days of Seller's receipt of Buyer's invoice therefor, accompanied
by reasonable supporting documentation (including copies of relevant Tax
bills). Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other with
respect to any Property Tax assessment or valuation (or protest in connection
therewith) by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Tax periods in
which the Closing Date occurs. If either party hereto receives a refund of any
Property Taxes for which the other is liable or responsible under this
Agreement, the party receiving such refund, whether received in cash, or as a
credit against another state and/or local Tax, shall, within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of such refund, remit it to the party who is liable. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTax Returns. Except as provided otherwise in this
Agreement: (i) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of a Straddle
Period that ends on the day before the Closing Date, Seller shall be
responsible for timely filing of all Tax Returns required by applicable Law to
be filed, and payment of all Taxes due, levied or imposed, in connection with
the Purchased Assets, the Business, or Employees and independent contractors
engaged in operating or maintaining the Purchased Assets or marketing products
produced at the Ethanol Plant; (ii) for any Post-Closing Tax Period or to the
portion of a Straddle Period that arises on or after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be responsible for the timely filing of all Tax Returns required by
applicable Law to be filed, and payment of all such Taxes levied or imposed,
in connection with the Purchased Assets, the Business, or employees and
independent contractors engaged in operating or maintaining the Purchased
Assets or marketing products produced at the Ethanol Plant; and (iii) control
of any legal or administrative proceedings concerning any such Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Assets shall rest with the party responsible for
payment therefor under this Section 8.4(c). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tRefund and Tax Benefits. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAny Tax refunds related to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities that are received by Buyer, and any amount credited
against Taxes to which Buyer becomes entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Period or to the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the day before the
Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to
Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tAny Tax refunds related to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities that are received by Seller, and any amount credited
against Taxes to  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

which Seller become entitled, that relate to any Post-Closing Tax Period or to
the portion of a Straddle Period that arises on or after the Closing Date
shall be for the account of Buyer, and Seller shall pay over to Buyer any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt
or entitlement thereto. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tCooperation. With respect to any Taxes related to the
Purchased Assets, Buyer and Seller agree (i) to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as applicable, such
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the computation of
any such Taxes or the filing of any applicable Tax Return, the making of any
election, or the preparation for or conduct of any audit, examination, or
other proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (ii) to furnish each other
with copies of any notices from any Governmental Authority that might affect
the liability of the other party for Taxes, (iii) to cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit, examination, or other proceeding, and (iv) that
no compromise or settlement of any item from a Tax audit or proceeding which
potentially affects the other party shall be agreed upon without prior written
consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tTax Treatment. Buyer and Seller agree, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, to treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as a purchase of the assets of the Seller by Buyer and will take no actions
inconsistent with such treatment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall be responsible for Taxes on any gain resulting
from the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyer hereunder. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.5 \t\t\tCasualty or Condemnation. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNotice. In the event that, prior to the Closing Date,
all or any portion of the Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed in whole
or in part (the portion of the Purchased Assets so damaged or destroyed, the
"Damaged Portion"), whether by fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, explosion
or other casualty (a "Casualty") or taken by condemnation or eminent domain or
by agreement in lieu thereof with any Person or Governmental Authority
authorized to exercise such rights (a "Taking"), Seller shall notify Buyer
promptly in writing (a "Casualty Notice") of the Casualty or Taking. The
Casualty Notice shall include: (i) a reasonable description of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the Casualty or Taking; (ii) Seller's preliminary
assessment of the effect of the Casualty or Taking on the Purchased Assets;
and (iii) Seller's preliminary assessment of whether, and the extent to which,
any losses sustained as a result of such Casualty or Taking are covered by one
or more insurance policies (including property/casualty and workers'
compensation policies) maintained immediately prior to the Closing by the
Seller 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tRepair or Replacement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tIn the event of a Casualty or Taking between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall elect, at its option, to
either (A) repair or replace or make adequate provision for the repair or
replacement of the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets at Seller's cost
prior to the Closing, in which case Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing
shall not be affected, but the Closing Date (and the End Date, if necessary)
shall be deferred until three (3) Business Days after repairs  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

or replacement have been completed and the Damaged Portion of the Purchased
Assets is fully repaired or restored to the condition thereof immediately
prior to such Casualty or Taking in accordance with applicable Laws or Orders,
or (B) negotiate with Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price to reflect the cost
to repair or replace the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets and the post-
Closing loss of net income associated with such business interruption (such
repair or replacement costs and loss of net income, the "Repair Costs").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller's election in clause (A) of this Section
8.5(b)(i) shall be unavailable and clause (B) of this Section 8.5(b)(i) shall
apply if the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets cannot reasonably be
expected to be fully repaired or restored to the condition thereof immediately
prior to such Casualty or Taking in accordance with applicable Laws or Orders
on or before the date that is 180 days following the occurrence of the
Casualty or Taking (the "Casualty Event Termination Date") 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIf Seller and Buyer agree on the Repair Costs within
fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of Seller's notice of the Casualty or
Taking (the "Repair Negotiation Period"), Buyer's obligation to effect the
Closing shall not be affected, but the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Repair Costs so agreed. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tIf Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Repair Costs
within the Repair Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"), Buyer or
Seller may request an engineering company (and/or other appropriate
specialist) that shall be mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller to evaluate
the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets and the loss of net income
associated with such business interruption and deliver to Buyer and Seller its
written estimate of the Repair Costs (the "Third-Party Estimate") within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Repair Negotiation Period. If the
Third-Party Estimate is less than the Buyer Casualty Threshold (or greater
than the Buyer Casualty Threshold or Seller Casualty Threshold, as applicable,
and neither party terminates the Agreement as permitted pursuant to Section
8.5(b)(iv)), Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing shall not be affected
and Buyer and Seller shall mutually resolve the Repair Cost Dispute after the
Closing in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the engineering company or other appropriate specialist
shall be deemed to be the Inspector for purposes of Section 2.3), with a post-
Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the finally-determined
Repair Costs. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section
8.5(f), if the Repair Costs as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or the Third-
Party Estimate, as applicable, (A) is equal to or greater than the Buyer
Casualty Threshold, Buyer may elect, by giving Seller written notice of
election within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Third-Party Estimate, or
(B) is equal to or greater than the Seller Casualty Threshold, Seller may
elect, by giving Buyer written notice of election within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the Third Party Estimate, to terminate this Agreement without
further obligation hereunder, except as provided in Section 11.2. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tCondemnation Awards. In the event of any reduction in
the Purchase Price in connection with a Taking of the Ethanol Plant, as
provided in Section 8.5(a), Buyer shall be  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t39  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

entitled to collect from any condemnor the entire award(s) that may be made in
any such proceeding, without deduction, to be paid out as follows: subject to
actual receipt of such award(s) by Buyer, (a) Buyer shall pay to Seller all
such amounts, up to the amount of such Purchase Price reduction, and (b) Buyer
shall be entitled to retain the balance (if any) of such award(s). Seller
shall not settle any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding relating to the
Ethanol Plant without Buyer's prior consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tPurchase Price Adjustment. Any adjustment of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.5(b) which is necessary to reflect a
final determination of Repair Costs after the Closing shall be made as
follows: (a) an adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be paid in cash by Seller;
and (b) an adjustment in favor of Seller shall be paid in cash to the extent
the Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to this Section 8.5. Any such
reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tDeferral of Closing Date and End Date. In the event of a
Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and the End Date shall be deferred until
(a) three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Third-Party Estimate, or (b)
if Seller elects the option in clause (A) of Section 8.5(b)(i), as provided
therein, but in no event beyond the Casualty Event Termination Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.6 \t\t\tFurther Assurances. After the Closing, each party shall
take such further actions and execute such further documents as may be
reasonably necessary or reasonably requested by any other party in order to
effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and to
provide such other party with the intended benefits of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 8.7 \t\t\tPost-Closing Preservation of Books and Records. For a
period of six (6) years following Closing (except as to Tax records for which
the period shall be the applicable statute of limitations), (A) Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, upon receipt of reasonable prior written
request from Seller, to (i) afford to Seller and its Affiliates reasonable
access during Buyer's normal business hours to the Records delivered to Buyer
by Seller and to those Transferred Employees having knowledge of the location

with copies of the Records delivered to Buyer by Seller; all in respect of (1)
financial reporting, (2) Tax or similar purposes, (3) addressing environmental
matters involving the Ethanol Plant, including any certification or reporting
obligations under the RFS Program, (4) Permits and permit applications, or (5)
any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or any other business purpose
related to the Ethanol Plant or the Excluded Liabilities; and (B) Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, upon receipt of reasonable prior
written request from Buyer, (i) afford to Buyer and its Affiliates reasonable
access during Seller's normal business hours to Seller's or its respective
Affiliate's books and Records related to the ownership or operation of the
Ethanol Plant or the Assumed Liabilities and to Seller's or its Affiliates'
employees having knowledge of the location or contents of such books and
Records; and (ii) provide Buyer, at Buyer's expense, with copies of the book
and Records related to the ownership or operation of the Ethanol Plant or the
Assumed Liabilities; all in respect of (1) financial reporting, (2) Tax or

 \t\t\t\t 10.4 \t\t\tCertain Limitations. The party making a claim under
this Article X is referred to as the "Indemnified Party" and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article X is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". The indemnification provided for in Section 10.2 and
Section 10.3 shall be subject to the following limitations: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThe Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) or Section
10.3(a), as the case may be, until the aggregate amount of all Losses in
respect of indemnification under Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.3(a) exceeds
two percent (2.0)% of the Base Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for
Losses in excess of the Deductible. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tSubject always to Section 10.4(c), the aggregate amount
of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to
Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.3(a), as the case may be, shall not exceed (i)
ten percent (10.0%) of the Base Purchase Price other than with respect to
Losses related to any breach of Seller's Fundamental Warranties, or (ii)
fifteen percent (15.0%) of the Base Purchase Price related to any breach of
Seller's Fundamental Warranties (the "Overall Cap"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tPayments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section
10.2 or Section 10.3 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of
any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party under applicable non-
affiliated insurance policies and any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment actually received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such
claim, net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, including
retrospective premium adjustments, if any. The parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, provided, that an
Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to make a claim for recovery
against any insurer of such Indemnified Party with respect to any such Losses. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tPayments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section
10.2 or Section 10.3 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount
equal to any Tax benefit recognized and realized as a result of such Loss by
the Indemnified Party (reduced by any tax detriments related to the loss or
the right to indemnification) (based solely on the Indemnified Party's good
faith determination and calculation, acting reasonably). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tIn no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to
any Indemnified Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t44  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

except, however, with respect to any of the foregoing paid or owing to a Third
Party with respect to a Third Party Claim, which damages shall be considered
part of damages and shall be covered by the indemnifications set forth in this
Article X. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tEach Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tSeller shall not be liable under Section 10.2(a) for any
Losses based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement if Buyer
had Knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tNo Losses may be claimed under Section 10.2 or Section
10.3 by any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses are included in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\t Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, solely for purposes of this Article X, in determining the existence
of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement and in determining the amount of Losses, no effect shall be given to
any qualification as to materiality or material adverse effect.

 \t\t\t\t 10.5 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedures. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThird Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other
legal proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of
the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 10.5(b), it shall have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right
to control the defense thereof. If  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t45  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to Section 10.5(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section
6.10) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tSettlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as provided in this Section 10.5(b). If a firm offer is made
to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of
a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section
10.5(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tDirect Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30)-day period, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access to the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t46  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.6 \t\t\tTax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.7 \t\t\tExclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 12.12, the
parties acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, their sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from
intentional fraud or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
X. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other party hereto and its Affiliates
and each of its representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X.
Nothing in this Section 10.7 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain
any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to Section
12.12 or to seek any remedy on account of any intentional fraud or willful
misconduct by any party hereto.

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tany court of competent jurisdiction or other

otherwise prohibiting prior to the Effective Time the consummation of the
transactions, and, in each case, such order or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement

 \t\t\t\t 12.7 \t\t\tEntire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules delivered herewith, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, represent the full and complete agreement of the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and replace
any prior understandings and agreements among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede and replace any prior understandings and
agreements (written or oral) among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). The recitals to this
Agreement are an integral part of this Agreement and hereby incorporated by

Agreement or concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents shall be made without the consent of the Seller and
the Buyer, except as and to the extent that any such parties shall be so
obligated by Law, in which case the other party shall be advised and the Buyer

 \t\t\t\t 12.9 \t\t\tSeverability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutual acceptable manner in order that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

reasonably deem necessary or desirable to carry out the intent and purposes of
this Agreement.

performance by any party of its obligations hereunder. If the date specified
in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business
Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for
giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next day which is a Business Day.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThe parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge
and agree that  \t\t

   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(i) the parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transaction and without that right, neither the Seller nor Buyer would have
entered into this Agreement. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe parties agree not to raise any objections to (i) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand; and (ii) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Seller pursuant to this Agreement.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

 \t\t\t\t 12.13 \t\t\tThird Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement

(grade) of each Chemical comprising the Chemical Inventory and the storage
capacity of the tank/facility where the Chemical Inventory is stored or used
is set forth on Schedule 2 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer shall have the right to confirm the volume of Chemicals as
reflected in the books and records of Seller. For this confirmation, the
Inventory Committee shall inspect and take a physical inventory of the
Chemicals at or immediately prior to the Inventory Transfer Time. If there are
any discrepancies between the volume of Chemicals reflected in the books and
records of Seller and the physical inventory conducted by the Inventory
Committee, the physical inventory shall control. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tC.Tank Heels. The Tank Heels shall be measured as part (and not
separately from) of the Product Inventory. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tD.In-Transit Inventory. The Parties expressly agree that In-Transit
Inventory shall not be included as part of the Inventories, and Seller hereby
retains all rights and obligations with respect to such In-Transit Inventory.
Any loaded railcar located within the rail yard of the Ethanol Plant that has
not been released to the railroad (billed) and for which no bill of lading has
been issued shall be considered and measured as Product Inventory. A full
listing of such loaded railcars shall be provided by Seller, along with a
listing of railcars released to the railroad within 24 hours of the Inventory
Transfer Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tE.Miscellaneous Inventories. All other Inventories at the Ethanol
Plant that cannot be measured, will transfer to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate at
Closing for no additional consideration in accordance with the
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tF.RINs. During the Inventory Process, Buyer shall have the right,
along with the Seller, to verify that the number of RINs generated from the
Ethanol Plant's inventory of finished Ethanol that makes up the Product
Inventory matches the volume of finished Ethanol that makes up the Product
Inventory (as determined pursuant to the measurement procedures herein). If
there are any discrepancies between the number of RINs and the final volume of
finished Ethanol, Seller and Buyer shall resolve the discrepancy, which may
include Seller acquisition of additional RINs if there is a shortfall. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.Calculation of Inventories. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tA.Product Inventory and WIP Inventory Quantity Report. Within 24 hours
following the physical inventory of the Product Tanks and Storage Facilities,

  \t\t

  \t\t\tExhibit B, Page 4  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

C.Inventory Value. The value of the Inventories (the "Inventory Value" shall
be calculated by multiplying (i) the quantities of the various Products
comprising the Product Inventory and WIP Inventory measured pursuant to Annex
I and reflected in the Product Inventory Quantity Report, or determined in
accordance with Section 3 B of this Exhibit as it relates to the Chemical
Inventory, by (ii) the relevant price formulas set forth in Annex II for such
Products, WIP Inventory and/or Chemicals; plus the mark to market value
associated with Commodity Contracts pursuant to Annex II. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tD.Estimated Inventory Value. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer as part of the Estimated
Net Working Capital Statement in accordance with Section 2.3(b) of the
Agreement, a statement (the "Estimated Inventory Valuation Statement") setting
forth Seller's reasonable good faith estimate of the Inventory Value as of the
Closing Date, as determined in accordance with Seller's books and records and
this Exhibit (the "Estimated Inventory Value"), together with supporting
calculations and information used to determine the Estimated Inventory
Value. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tE.Product Inventory Quality Report. On or before fifteen (15) days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Inspection Company to
provide the parties with a physical inventory report indicating the
qualitative test results by tank or storage facility of the Product Inventory
and WIP Inventory (the "Product Inventory Quality Report"). During the fifteen
(15) day review period following receipt by Seller and Buyer of Product
Inventory Quality Report, either Buyer or Seller may question the calculations
and/or laboratory results set forth in Product Inventory Quality Report and
the appropriate members of the Inventory Committee shall resolve any
outstanding quality or quantity (as it specifically relates to quality
valuation) disputes. At the end of such review period and following resolution
of all quality and quantity (as it specifically relates to quality valuation)
disputes, the quality and quantity (as it specifically relates to quality
valuation) entries set forth in the adjusted (if any) Product Inventory
Quality Report will become the official quality and quantity (as it
specifically relates to quality valuation) measurements of the Product
Inventory and WIP Inventory as of the Inventory Transfer Time. The quantity of
Chemical Inventory as determined in accordance with Section 3 B hereof and the
quantity of the Product Inventory as reflected in the Product Inventory
Quantity Report, as may be adjusted based on the final Product Inventory
Quality Report, will become the "Final Inventory Determination". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tF.Inventory Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Final Inventory
Determination reveals a quantity of Inventories that is less than or more than
the Inventories reflected in the Product Inventory Quantity Report or
calculated as part of the Estimated Inventory Value, the Inventory Value
(calculated pursuant to Section 4 C hereof) shall be adjusted accordingly,
based on the increased or decreased quantity of Inventories, as part of the
Net Working Capital Adjustment. If the Final Inventory Determination requires
a quality adjustment to the Inventory Value, such adjustment shall be made as
part of the Net Working Capital Adjustment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tA.Inventory Measurement Procedures for Product Inventory \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.Eligible Quantities. In determining the quantities of the various
Products to be inventoried, all volumes and mass determinations shall be
determined on the basis of the Inventory Transfer Time and as of the
completion of delivery to or from the Ethanol Plant. Non-usable and non-
merchantable quantities of Products and materials such as water and other
foreign contaminants commonly referred to as sediment and water shall be
excluded for purposes of determining the quantities of inventory. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.Independent Inspection. All measurements and verifications involved
in the inventory determination will be done by the Inspection Company with the
participation of the Inventory Committee representatives. The Inventory
Committee representatives shall have the right to participate in the physical
inventory process by observing the measurements, verifications and other
procedures. In addition, each of Buyer and Seller shall each have the right to
have its own independent accountants, consultants, or agents present during
the physical inventory, at each such party's sole cost and expense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.Measurement Protocol. All measurements, sampling and analyses
related to the determination of quality and quantity of the Product Inventory
shall be done in accordance with the latest versions of the API Manual of
Petroleum Measurement Standards as published by the American Petroleum
Institute (the "API Manual"), latest ASTM test methods as published by ASTM
International, or by currently accepted industry standards or procedures. The
specific standards to be used shall be determined by Buyer and Seller not less
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. All issues related to
inventory measurements such as sampling, temperature readings, and gauging
shall be resolved by the Inventory Committee to the best of its ability at the
time the measurement is taken. Any disputes shall be resolved by noon the
following working day (or in the case of quality disputes, promptly following
receipt of analyses) by the Inventory Committee by majority vote, excluding
the Inspection Company. The Inspection Company shall act as a subject matter
expert in the discussion for the resolution of disputes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.Certification of Measurements and Laboratory. The Inspection Company
will standardize, certify or validate, with proper documentation, all
measurement equipment (gauging tapes, weigh scales, temperature devices) used
in the inventory process. The Inspection Company will provide quality
assurance documentation for its laboratory used for the physical inventory
process. If an Ethanol Plant laboratory is utilized, the Inspection Company
will review the Ethanol Plant laboratory's quality assurance program,
including calibration documentation for all equipment used, for compliance and
recommend corrections to non-compliant issues. All analyses conducted in the
Ethanol Plant laboratory are to be witnessed by a qualified technician
employed by the Inspection Company. The Parties may each have their Inventory
Committee representative witness all analyses. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\tExhibit B, Page 6  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

5.Acceptance and Review. The measurements of the Product Inventory and WIP
Inventory shall be done at the agreed time by the Inventory Committee. Buyer
and Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the accuracy of physical inventory
of the Product Tanks and Storage Facilities as recorded by the Inspection
Company at the time of the physical inventory and noted on a measurement sheet
(the "Measurement Sheet") if the authorized representative of each of the
parties "signs-off" on the Measurement Sheet. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.Pre-Closing Inventory Procedures. Prior to the Inventory Transfer
Time, Seller's personnel shall determine which tanks, silos or flat storage
areas comprising the Product Tanks and Storage Facilities shall be active and
inactive as of the Inventory Transfer Time. The aforementioned Inventory
Schedule will take into account this determination and will provide for
performing the physical inventory of both active and inactive storage tanks
prior to the Inventory Transfer Time. Said Inventory Schedule will be subject
to the approval of the Inventory Committee, and shall indicate the following
for each tank, silo, or flat storage area to be inventoried: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Storage tank location, tank number, and tank type; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Tank strapping tables and tank drawings \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Tank Heels (volume) \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.Physical Inventory Procedures \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)General: Tanks with floating roofs shall have roofs outside
critical zone when measurements are performed. Tank mixers shall be shut off
at least two (2) hours prior to gauging. Silo augers will be shut off at least
one (1) hour prior to gauging. Temperature measurements will be obtained at
the time of gauging, except as otherwise provided herein. For any 190 proof
and 200 proof ethanol tanks included as part of the Product Tanks and Storage
Facilities side gauge and/or DCS reading through level transmitter shall be
used. To the extent applicable, the Parties will cooperate to develop mutually
reasonably acceptable procedures, including a cutoff time (e.g. six hours
prior the Inventory Transfer Time) to suspend any receiving and shipping
activity, to address measurement of Products that are in the midst of delivery
to or from the Ethanol Plant as of the Inventory Transfer Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Nonmoving Tanks (Inactive Tanks): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)All Product Tanks and Storage Facilities that are standing with no
movement in or out as of the Inventory Transfer Time ("Inactive Tanks") will
be measured, gauged and sampled prior to the Inventory Transfer Time in
accordance with the Inventory Schedule. All valves in and out of the tank or
silo will be closed and sealed at the time of gauging. The Inspection Company
will seal the tank valves and will be responsible for recording seal numbers
and checking of seals. If it is necessary to break seals to transfer  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\tExhibit B, Page 7  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Products into or out of a sealed gauged tank, prior notification and
confirmation must be obtained from the Inventory Committee in order to keep
accurate records of the proceedings. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Once inventory measurement operations have started, no tank
switching, changes or movements shall be made without notification to the
Inventory Committee. If tank seals are broken, the impacted tanks must be
resealed when movement stops. Each such affected tank must then be gauged,
sampled and temperature determined anew. Otherwise, it will be gauged as an
Active Tank (defined below). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Inactive Tanks that are required for thermal relief of connecting
pipelines will be manually gauged and compared to the tank's automatic gauge
reading. The automatic gauge will be confirmed as close to the Inventory
Transfer Time as possible. The automatic gauge reading will be monitored every
10 minutes for 90 minutes before and after the transfer time to confirm that
there was no movement into or out of said tank. In cases where the automatic
gauge readings indicate tank movement, the tank will be gauged as an Active
Tank. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Moving Tanks (Active Tanks): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Product Tanks and Storage Facilities that must have movements in or
out ("Active Tanks") during the physical inventory quantification process as
of the Inventory Transfer Time will be manually gauged during a period in
which said tanks and facilities are temporarily inactive, as close to the
Inventory Transfer Time as possible. The physical inventory of these tanks and
facilities will be obtained using the applicable procedures prescribed herein
and must coincide with the "closing" of rack meters where appropriate. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Each Active Tank that will remain active during the inventory
period will be measured as close to the Inventory Transfer Time as possible.
The gross inventory measurement will be compared against the Active Tank's
automatic gauges. The volume difference between the two measurements, in gross
inches or fractions thereof, will be recorded on the tank's physical inventory
worksheet. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)WIP Inventory. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)For corn included in WIP - DCS readings (through level transmitter)
shall be provided along with support lab data to determine percentage of the
corn in WIP. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)For any slurry, liquefaction and beerwell tanks, the Inventory
Committee shall obtain DCS % full and capacity (including source for stated
capacity) \t\t

discretion and approval the amount/volume of sample obtained will be increased
dependent on required laboratory analyses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)Distillers Grains: A minimum of two composite sample sets will be
obtained per silo or storage area per industry standards. At the Inventory
Committee's discretion and approval the amount/volume of sample obtained will
be increased dependent on required laboratory analyses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)Quality Analyses: Besides the standard analyses needed for volume
calculations (API gravity, water and sediment determinations) the analyses
will reflect the applicable specifications as outlined in Note 1 on Annex
II. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6)Retention: All samples (used and unused) shall be sealed and
retained. These sealed samples will be properly maintained by the Inspection
Company for a period of ninety (90) days or a mutually agreed retention time.

Inspection Company on the individual Measurement Sheet: (1) tank location,
identification, and type, (2) date and time of measurements, (3) product type
within tank, (4) manual gauge or weigh scale data recorded in appropriate
units and fractional units, (5) measurement method, that is, innage or ullage
or weigh scale, (6) temperature readings, (7) Free Water measurement recorded
in appropriate units, and (8) the tanks automatic reading, and (9) seal
numbers if tank valves are sealed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.Meter Readings - Loading Racks And Pipelines \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Inactive Systems. Meter readings shall be obtained on all inactive
metered systems (tank truck rack and rail car rack) in advance of the
Inventory Transfer Time. The Inspection Company will secure these systems by
sealing same to ensure that no liquid Products are moved through these systems
during the physical inventory process. The non-resetable total amount of
product movements as indicated from the flow computers will be provided to and
retained by Buyer, Seller and the Inspection Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Active Systems: Meter readings shall be obtained on all active
metered systems coincident with the physical inventory measurements obtained
on the storage tank(s) by supplying said metered systems. The non-resetable
total amount of product sales or other product transactions recorded through
the flow computer of each meter will be provided to and retained by Buyer,
Seller and the Inspection Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.Post-Inventory Procedures. The Inventory Committee members and the
Inspection Company representative shall sign the Measurement Sheet for each
tank, silo or other storage facility inventoried, which shall include the
calculation of gross observed volume or gross weight. Similarly, the Inventory
Committee members shall identify and acknowledge all closing weigh scale and
meter readings, as well as the last rack sale, Products shipments, and
Products receipts prior to the physical inventory. An inspection shall be made
to assure that all systems previously closed and sealed remained inactive
during the physical inventory and that no product movements occurred through
these systems. Any seals found to be broken during this inspection would
subject that tank facility or system to be re-weighed or re- gauged. At this
time all seals will be removed by the Inspection Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.Calculation of Final Measured Product Inventory and WIP Inventory
Quantity. The Inspection Company will tabulate the data from the signed
individual tank Measurement Sheets and using current tank calibration tables
will determine the total observed volume or mass for each of the Product Tanks
and Storage Facilities ("Total Observed Volume or Mass"). Correcting for Free
Water and other impurities, applying roof corrections, applying tank shell
corrections, or other applicable and agreed corrections and using the most
current CTL and CPL correction factors, the Total Observed Volumes and Mass
will be corrected to Gross Standard Volumes and Mass and then to Net Standard
Volumes and Mass. In the event calibration tables (as measured and calculated
by an independent company in the tank calibration business) do not exist, the
Product Inventory and WIP Inventory shall be calculated using the normal
method in use at the Ethanol Plant. Once official calibration tables are
available, the Product Inventory and WIP  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\tExhibit B, Page 10  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit using the most current versions of the
RFS-2 for volume correction factors. \t\t

 \t\t\tAnnex II \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tInventory Valuation \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis Annex II sets forth the valuation formulae and procedures for
valuing the Inventories in order to determine the Inventory Value. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Commodity Contracts outlined in Schedule 1.1(q) of the Agreement
will be brought to market as of the Closing Date using the valuation formulae
outlined below and the adjustment to prices outlined in Schedule 1. As relates
to corn contracts, within 5 days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller
will determine appropriate basis levels for all future delivery period
contracts. Parties agree that for any contract purchased or sold on a
delivered basis that Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable
estimates to determine the appropriate market price. In addition, the parties
agree to cooperate in the exchange of corn futures information and
positions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExcept as specifically set forth herein, the applicable price used to
calculate the total value for each applicable portion of the Inventories will
be based on a five (5) day wrap around the Inventory Transfer Time, as
follows: two (2) days before, the day of, and two (2) days after the Inventory
Transfer Time. If the Inventory Transfer Time falls on a Saturday, then the
effective price for the prior Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and the following
Monday and Tuesday will be used. If the Inventory Transfer Time falls on a
Sunday, then the effective price for the prior Thursday and Friday and the
following Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will be used, so as to always use five
(5) separate quotations. If a holiday should occur within the 5-day range, the
holiday will be excluded and only a 4-day range will be used. To the extent
this Annex II references a differential, such differential shall be based on
the last trade prior to Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAll volumes of Product making up the Product Inventory and the WIP
Inventory that do not meet the relevant quality specifications shall be
subject to downward price adjustments in an amount to be determined by the
Parties negotiating in good faith. \t\t

 \t\t\tEMPLOYMENT MATTERS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.1Employment Offers to Active Employees. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to), on or prior
to the Closing Date, make an offer of employment to each Employee other than
(i) those Employees who are on short-term disability leave and do not return
to active employment within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, or (ii)
those Employees who are on long-term disability leave (collectively, "Leave").
Any such employment offers by Buyer will be subject to and contingent upon the
occurrence of Closing. Seller agrees to allow Buyer reasonable access to all
Employees who are to become Transferred Employees beginning after the
Effective Date, to enable Buyer, at its option, to conduct informational and
benefit enrollment meetings with the relevant Employees in anticipation of
Closing. All Employees who accept employment with Buyer, pursuant to the
offers described in this Section 1.1 are referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees". The date on which a Transferred Employee commences active
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, shall be the
effective date of his or her employment with Buyer and is hereafter referred
to as that Transferred Employee's "Transfer Date"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Seller shall, promptly, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days, after the Effective Date, provide Buyer with employment data,
including the name, title, years of service, date of hire, current salary,
hourly rate, wages, bonus and incentive opportunity, credited and unused
vacation and/or sick pay, exempt or non-exempt status and the job grade of
each Transferred Employee to, among other purposes, enable Buyer to input such
persons into Buyer's payroll and other relevant computer systems in advance of
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Buyer shall offer Transferred Employees compensation and benefits
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided by
Seller (or its Affiliates) in their current employment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Buyer shall have no obligation with regard to former Employees who
are retired, or who are not or shall have ceased to be Employees as of the
Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.2Service Credit. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall give the Transferred Employees credit for their service recognized by
Seller or Seller's Affiliates prior to the Closing Date (as reflected in the
employment data furnished to Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1(b)) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit determination under all applicable plans and
programs of Buyer as well as for purposes of determining any vacation
eligibility under the Buyer's Benefit Plans. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.3Vacation. Seller shall be responsible for paying the
Transferred Employees for any vacation accrued but not used as of the Closing
Date under the applicable vacation policy of Seller or Seller's Affiliates.
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide all Transferred Employees
with vacation in accordance with Buyer's or its Affiliate's vacation policy
based upon the recognized credited service amounts, subject to proration from
and after the Closing Date, of such Transferred Employees with Seller or
Seller's Affiliates. \t\t

Section 1.4Seller Obligations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Seller shall be responsible for all such salaries and wages
accruing prior to the Closing Date as well as for any Liabilities due to, or
accrued by, Employees as of the Closing Date under the Seller's Benefit Plans,
including earned or accrued vacation time, bonuses, incentive payments
(including but not limited to the variable cash incentive program, retention
bonus, special recognition awards, attendance awards, and special compensation
pay for high work periods), and restricted stock units. Seller shall be
responsible for any severance pay or benefits that accrue under any severance
pay plan or policy of Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing with
respect to each Employee, whether or not such Employee is also a Transferred
Employee. Seller hereby retains as an Excluded Liability, all Liabilities or
obligations arising out of or with respect to (i) the Transferred Employees'
employment with, their benefits, or the termination of their employment from
Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing; (ii) any employees formerly
employed by Seller or its Affiliates, employment with, or the termination of
their employment from Seller or its Affiliates prior to Closing; (iii) any and
all employee related claims or grievances arising prior to the Closing; (iv)
all Seller's Benefit Plans; and (v) to the extent relating to the period prior
to Closing, the misclassification by Seller or its Affiliates of any Person
providing services to the Ethanol Plant or to Seller or its Affiliates as an
independent contractor or consultant where such classification by Seller or
its Affiliates should have been as an Employee or former employee. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.5WARN Act. Neither Seller nor Buyer will take or fail to
take, any actions that would violate the provisions of the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the "WARN Act") or any
similar state law (including the giving of notices as may be required to
Governmental Authorities as well as affected Employees). Buyer shall be
responsible for, and Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and
against all Losses arising out of the notification or other requirements of
the WARN Act with respect to Transferred Employees on or after the
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.6Severance. In the event that the employment of any
Transferred Employee is terminated by Buyer within twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, other than for violation of generally applicable
policies of Buyer or its Affiliate, then the Buyer shall provide such
Transferred Employee with severance pay and benefits available under any
severance package that Buyer may make available to similarly situated
employees of Buyer or its Affiliate. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.7No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Exhibit
C shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any
employee or former employee (and any beneficiaries, dependents or
representatives thereof) of Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, and no provision of this Exhibit C shall create such third-party
beneficiary rights in any Person in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Seller Plan or arrangement of
Buyer, the Seller or its Affiliates, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Seller Plan or arrangement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.8Workers' Compensation. Buyer's workers' compensation
program shall be responsible for all claims for benefits that are based upon
events occurring at or after the Transfer Date by participating Transferred
Employees. Seller's workers' compensation program shall be responsible for all
claims for benefits that are based upon events occurring prior to Transfer
Date by participating Transferred Employees. \t\t

possess except as set forth herein or any other defense Obligor may possess

written notice to the other (the "Offer"); thereafter, either the recipient of
the Offer may accept the Offer, or for a period of 60 days following receipt

single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude

be deemed a waiver of the same right or rights on any future occasion.
