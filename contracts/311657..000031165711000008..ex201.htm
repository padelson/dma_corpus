holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13

stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and any Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $66.50 (referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration") in cash payable to the holder thereof.
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of
a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 3.03, without interest, and except as otherwise
provided with respect to unpaid dividends and other distributions in Section

Section 3.02 Dissenting Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock issued and

shareholders who shall not have voted such shares in favor of the Merger and
who shall have otherwise satisfied all requirements of Oklahoma Law, including
Section 1091 of the OGCA, to have appraisal rights under Section 1091
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 3.01(c), but the holders thereof
instead shall be entitled to receive, and the Dissenting Shares shall only
represent the right to receive, payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1091 of the OGCA; provided, however,
that (i) if such a holder fails to demand properly in writing from the
Surviving Corporation the appraisal of that shareholder's shares in accordance
with Section 1091 of the OGCA or, after making such demand, subsequently
delivers an effective written withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish
his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 1091 of the OGCA,
or (ii) if a court shall determine that such holder is not entitled to receive
payment for his shares or such holder shall otherwise lose his appraisal
rights, then, in any such case, each share of Company Common Stock held of
record by such holder or holders shall automatically be converted into, and
represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 3.01(c), upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company recognizes that Parent has a
substantial and direct financial interest with respect to the ultimate
satisfaction of any Dissenting Shares. Therefore, the Company agrees to
promptly provide to Parent any information and copies of any documents
reasonably requested by Parent relating to the appraisal rights of holders of
the Company Common Stock, including any written communication by the Company
to such shareholders and any written communication received by the Company
from any such shareholders. In the event any shareholders exercise their
appraisal rights in a manner pursuant to which their shares of Company Common
Stock become Dissenting Shares, then the Company shall permit legal counsel
for the Parent to participate in any legal proceedings related thereto,
including any legal proceeding to determine the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for
Dissenting Shares or offer to settle, settle or negotiate in respect of any
such demands. Any cash paid in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be paid by
the Company solely with its own funds, and the Company shall not be reimbursed
therefor by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly.

Company shall select and appoint a commercial bank or trust company who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent to act as the paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately available funds in the amount of the aggregate Merger
Consideration under Section 3.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(c) out of the
Exchange Fund.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event more than three Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.08))
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.08) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or (B) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is otherwise not applicable. Except
as otherwise provided with respect to unpaid dividends and other distributions
in Section 3.04, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.03, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, as
provided in this Agreement. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.

  

  

Section 3.04 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

Section 3.05 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

  

  

Section 3.06 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheatment or similar
applicable Law.

  

  

Section 3.07 Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
provided that: (a) such investments shall only be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion (it being understood that any and all interest or income
earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent); (b) no such investment shall relieve Parent
or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Agreement, and
following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
in the amount of such losses; and (c) no such investment shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.08 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with Section 3.01(c) for the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. When authorizing
such payment of Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, Parent may, in its
discretion thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to make a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent or the
Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, including the posting by such Person of a bond.

Section 3.09 Adjustment to Prevent Dilution. In the event that prior to the
Effective Time there is a change in the number of shares of Company Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution,
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender
or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

  

  

Section 3.10 Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Applicable Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Stock
Options, as the case may be, in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Except as set forth in (i) any Filed Company SEC Document (excluding any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any forward looking
statements (whether or not specifically identified as such), including future
operating results) (provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to Section
4.03) or (ii) in the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being understood that an
item disclosed in one Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to the Section of this Agreement that has

apparent), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  

  

Section 4.01 Organization, Standing and Power. The Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries is validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as it is currently conducted, except for such failures to
be in good standing or to have such power and authority, that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be likely to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or its ownership of its properties make such qualification necessary,
except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof have been
made available to Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 4.02 Company Subsidiaries. The Persons listed in Section 1.01 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule are the only Subsidiaries of the Company. The
Company owns or has the right to acquire directly or indirectly each of the

purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the OGCA, the

Section 4.04 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company other than the receipt of the
affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement (the "Company Shareholder
Approval"), and except for the Company Shareholder Approval in the case of the
Merger, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) the valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity.

  

  

(b) The Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, at a meeting duly called and held prior to execution of this
Agreement, has unanimously: (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the Merger; (ii) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; (iii) resolved
to recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock adopt this
Agreement (the "Company Recommendation"); and (iv) directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the holders of the Company Common Stock for their
adoption at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose.

  

  

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.06, the only vote of holders of any class or series of Company
Capital Stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is the
Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

Section 4.05 No Conflicts; Consents. The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and compliance with the terms
hereof will not, conflict with, or require any consent or approval under, or
result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person
under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon
any of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under, any provision of (a) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the
comparable charter, bylaws or organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary, (b) any Material Contract or (c) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in the following sentence, any provision of any Order or
Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the cases of clauses (b) or (c) above,
any such items that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Consent of, from or
with any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, other than (i)
compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and any required Foreign
Competition Law filings, (ii) the filing with the SEC of such reports under
Section 13 or Section 14 of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (iv) such other Consents as are set
forth in Section 4.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (v) such other
Consents that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.06 SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a)
The Company has timely filed with or furnished to the SEC, as applicable, all
Company SEC Documents. As of its respective date, each Company SEC Document
(including any financial statements or schedules included therein) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters from the SEC with respect to any of the Company
SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of
the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding
SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

  

  

(b) As of their respective dates, the Financial Statements complied as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, having been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto and, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Law) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), and fairly presented, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the absence of footnote disclosure and to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

 

(c) The Company has previously furnished or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the annual financial statement for the year ended December
31, 2009, and quarterly financial statements for each of the quarters ended
March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010, together with all
exhibits and schedules thereto (collectively, the "Insurance Company
Statements"), with respect to each of the Company Subsidiaries set forth in
Section 4.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Insurance Company
Subsidiaries"), in each case as filed with the Governmental Entity charged
with supervision of such Insurance Company Subsidiary in its jurisdiction of
domicile. The Insurance Company Statements were prepared in all material
respects in conformity with accounting standards and accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the Governmental Entity charged with supervision
the applicable Insurance Company Subsidiary in its jurisdiction of domicile
("Applicable Accounting Principles") applied on a consistent basis, except as
may have been noted therein and present fairly, in all material respects, to
the extent required by and in conformity with Applicable Accounting
Principles, the financial condition of such Company Insurance Subsidiary at
the respective dates and the results of operations, changes in capital and
surplus and cash flows of such Insurance Company Subsidiary for each of the
periods then ended.

  

 

  

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no liabilities, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise that would be required to be
disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
liabilities (i) stated or reserved against in the Financial Statements, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2009 or in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger or in connection with the
exploration of strategic alternatives announced by the Company on October 25,
2010 (including fees and expenses of advisors of the Company or the Special
Committee), none of which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (iii) under any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
any of them or their respective assets or properties are bound or (iv) that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of
the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of any type (including any
off-balance sheet arrangement required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) that have
not been so described in the Company SEC Documents nor any obligations to
enter into any such arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, had unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents of approximately $47.8 million and outstanding Indebtedness of
approximately $0.9 million.

  

  

Section 4.07 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to the Company's
shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect
to statements made in or omitted from the Proxy Statement relating to Parent
or its Affiliates based on information supplied by Parent or its Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 4.08 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since September 30, 2010 to
the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business. Since September 30, 2010, there has not been any change, event or
effect that has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2010
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action that, if
taken after the date of this Agreement without Parent's consent, would
constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 6.01.

  

  

Section 4.09 Taxes. (a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have: (i)
prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any
extension of time within which to file) all material Tax Returns required to
be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and
accurate in all material respects; (ii) paid all material Taxes that are
required to be paid or that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are
obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
party; and (iii) not waived any statute of limitations with respect to
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material
Tax assessment or deficiency. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened audits, examinations,
investigations or other proceedings in respect of material Taxes or material
Tax matters. There are not, to the Knowledge of the Company, any unresolved
questions or claims concerning the Company's or any of the Company
Subsidiaries' Tax liability that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been a party to any distribution
occurring during the last 30 months in which the parties to such distribution
treated the distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) applied. The Company is not
a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or
could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law). The Company has
not been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Each contract, arrangement or plan of the Company
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes
of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary and operational
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable guidance issued
thereunder in all material respects. The Company has no obligation to
indemnify any Person for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the
Code.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, a transaction
which is a "reportable transaction" for purposes of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6011-4(b) (including any transaction which the IRS has determined to
be a "listed transaction" for purposes of 1.6011-4(b)(2)), or would be
reportable to a similar extent under any other provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been
included in any "consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" Tax Return (other than
Tax Returns which include only the Company and any Company Subsidiary)
provided for under the Laws of the United States, any foreign jurisdiction or
any state or locality for any taxable period for which the statute of
limitations has not expired. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
the subject of or bound by any private letter ruling, technical advice
memorandum, closing agreement or similar ruling, memorandum or agreement with
any Tax Authority.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 4.10 Benefit Plans. (a) Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each "employee benefit plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), and each other material
employee benefit plan, agreement, program or policy, which is sponsored or
maintained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is required to contribute, or with
respect to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has any
liability or potential liability. All such plans, agreements, programs,
policies and arrangements, regardless of materiality, shall be collectively
referred to as the "Company Plans."

  

  

(b) Each Company Plan has been established and complies and has been
administered in form and operation, in all material respects, in accordance
with its terms and applicable Laws. Each Company Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS upon which it may rely as
to its qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred with respect to such plan that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect such qualification or result in material liability to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in ERISA Section 406 and Section 4975 of the Code) or
breach of fiduciary duty has occurred with respect to any Company Plan for
which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates may have any material
liability.

  

  

(c) With respect to any Company Plan (or the assets thereof), (i) no actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits), or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any audits or investigations, are pending or have been, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company,
no facts or circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any such audits, investigations, actions, suits or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits).

  

  

(d) No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation or liability (including contingent
liability) under or with respect to Title IV or Sections 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 of the Code.

  

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to
contribute to, or any liability or obligation with respect to (i) a
Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a Foreign Plan, or (iii) a plan, policy agreement or
arrangement that provides for retiree or post-employment medical, life
insurance or other welfare-type benefits (other than health continuation
coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code for which the covered
individual pays the full cost of coverage).

  

  

(f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone,
or in combination with any other event (where such event would not alone have
an effect described in this sentence), will not give rise to any liability
under any Company Plan, including liability for severance pay, unemployment
compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
to any employee, officer, director, or other service provider of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or their
beneficiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have appropriately classified persons who provide services as either employees
or independent contractors for federal income tax, Company Plan participation,
and all other purposes.

  

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary have any material liability
to persons who were not permitted to participate in a Company Plan due to
their designation as an independent contractor. Each employee of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries has been properly classified as "exempt" or "non-
exempt" under applicable Law.

  

  

(i) The Company has made available to Parent: (i) copies of all material
documents setting forth the terms of each Company Plan, including all
amendments thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the most recent
annual report (Form Series 5500), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in
connection with each Company Plan; (iii) the most recent actuarial reports (if
applicable) for all Company Plans; (iv) the most recent summary plan
description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each Company Plan;
(v) all material written contracts, instruments or agreements relating to each
Company Plan, including administrative service agreements and group insurance
contracts; (vi) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter issued
with respect to each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code.

  

  

Section 4.11 Employment and Labor Matters. There is no labor strike, material
labor dispute, material work stoppage or other material labor difficulty
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. None of the employees of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no representation petition has been filed by
an employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or is pending
before the National Labor Relations Board, and no union organizing campaign is
in progress or has been threatened.

  

  

Section 4.12 Litigation. Except for such Orders or Proceedings that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there are (a) no Orders to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties
or assets are bound that require the performance of any material future
obligation or that restrict or limit the Company's operations in any material
respect, and (b) no Proceedings pending and for which service of process has
been made against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened or pending against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Without limiting the foregoing, except as set forth on Section
4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) there is no Proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened and (ii) to the Knowledge of
the Company there is no inquiry or investigation pending or threatened, in
each case by any Governmental Entity against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24

negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.02,
if the Company has otherwise complied with its obligations under this Section
6.02, but only prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, in
the event that the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative
Transaction Proposal from any Person, the Company may, subject to compliance
with this Section 6.02(c) (i) furnish or provide access to information or data
to the Person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal with respect to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries; provided that the Company has received
from the Person so requesting the information an executed Acceptable
Confidentially Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall promptly
make available to Parent and Merger Sub any written material non-public
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person pursuant to this Section 6.02(c)(i) to the extent such
information was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub) and
(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person and its Representatives with respect to such Alternative
Transaction Proposal; provided, that prior to taking any action described in
Section 6.02(c)(i) or Section 6.02(c)(ii) above, (x) the Company Board or the
Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (y) the Company Board or
the Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Transaction
Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 6.02(e) or Section 6.02(f), neither the
Company Board nor the Special Committee shall (i) change, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) fail to make or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer that
affirmatively supports such offer or (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to the shareholders, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) through

Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar agreement (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance herewith) (an "Alternative Transaction Agreement") relating
to any Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company
Board or the Special Committee determines, in good faith, that a bona fide
Alternative Transaction Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.02 is a Superior Proposal (to the extent that such Alternative
Transaction Proposal has not been withdrawn), the Company Board or the Special
Committee may, in response to a Superior Proposal, effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Transaction
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, only if:

  

  

(i) the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws;

  

  

(ii) [Reserved];

  

  

(iii) (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), to the effect
that the Company Board or the Special Committee has resolved to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.02(e), which notice shall specify the identity of
the party making the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and
unredacted copies of the relevant material transaction documents relating to
such Superior Proposal (including debt and equity commitment letters and
guarantees); and (B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and
legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Alternative Transaction Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; provided, that in the event of any material revisions to the
Alternative Transaction Proposal that the Company Board or the Special
Committee has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.02(e)(iii) with respect to such new written
notice (it being understood and agreed that (x) in such event the Notice
Period shall be two (2) Business Days and (y) in no event shall any such
additional two-Business-Day Notice Period be deemed to shorten the initial
three-Business-Day Notice Period); and

  

  

(iv) if the Company Board or the Special Committee authorizes terminating this
Agreement or entering into an Alternative Transaction Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(d)(i), including the payment of the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.02(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board or
the Special Committee may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event
("Change of Recommendation") if the Company Board or the Special Committee has
determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that prior to taking such action, (x) the Company Board or the
Special Committee has given Parent at least three (3) Business Days' prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the
Intervening Event, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, to enable Parent
to revise the terms of this Agreement, in such a manner as would obviate the
need for taking such action as a result of an Intervening Event and (z)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or the Special
Committee shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement,
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event still would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

  

(g) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Change of Recommendation shall
change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders with regard to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to
the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of each of the
Company Board and the Special Committee, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with their obligations under applicable Law; provided that the
Company Board and the Company shall not recommend that the shareholders of the
Company tender their shares in connection with any tender offer or exchange
offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal) unless the
requirements of Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f) shall have been satisfied.

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Alternative Transaction Proposal" means any inquiry, offer or proposal
relating to (i) the acquisition of twenty (20) percent or more of the Equity
Interests in the Company (by vote or by value) by any Third Party, (ii) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, share exchange,
sale of assets, recapitalization, equity investment, joint venture,
liquidation, dissolution or other transaction which would result in any Third
Party acquiring assets (including capital stock of or interest in any
Subsidiary of the Company) representing, directly or indirectly, twenty (20)
percent or more of the net revenues, net income or total assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to which any person or group (or the shareholders of any person) would own,
directly or indirectly, twenty (20) percent or more of the aggregate voting
power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (iv) any
tender offer or exchange offer, as such terms are defined under the Exchange
Act, that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party beneficially owning
twenty (20) percent or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
and any other voting securities of the Company, in each case, other than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal that is not solicited or received in violation of Section 6.02 that
the Special Committee or Company Board has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms,
taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Company's shareholders than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in writing in response to
such proposal or otherwise); provided, that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "twenty (20) percent" in the definition
of Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
(50) percent."

Subsidiaries or violate any of its contractual obligations or any obligations
with respect to confidentiality or privacy; and provided, further, that
nothing in this Section 7.03 shall require the Company to take or allow any

by the foregoing clause (i), those individuals indentified in clause (i) of
the definition of "Knowledge" and (iii) each person who served at the request
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel), judgments, fines, penalties,
interest, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, "Losses") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time relating to the
Indemnified Party's service with or at the request of the Company, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any
Indemnified Party in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding, subject to (if legally required) receipt of an undertaking by

indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those set forth in the Company Charter

years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties. The parties agree that
the provisions relating to exoneration of directors and officers and the
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses incurred in defense of
any action or suit in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws and the comparable
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters
occurring through the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time; provided that all rights to indemnification and advancements in respect
of any action, suit or proceeding pending or asserted or claim made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding or resolution of such claim.

or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46

(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that an Indemnified Party
may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other rights and obligations provided
for in this Section 7.06.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. No
release executed by any Indemnified Party in connection with his or her
departure from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a release or waiver of any of the indemnity or other rights provided
such Indemnified Party in this Section 7.06, unless the release or waiver of
the provisions of this Section 7.06 is expressly provided for in such release.

  

  

Section 7.07 Public Announcements.

and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements (including conference calls with investors
and analysts) with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, by court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case such party shall use all reasonable efforts to consult

statement.

of benefits under vacation and severance plans (but not benefit accrual for
any purpose, including under a defined benefit pension plan) to the extent
such service was taken into account under a corresponding Company Plan and

requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations,
and shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Company Plan
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums for such plan year as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.09(a), service and
other amounts shall not be credited to Company Employees or Former Company
Employees (or their eligible dependents) to the extent the crediting of such
service or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits.

arrangement, or (ii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations
in any Person (including any Company Employee or Former Company Employee),
including with respect to (x) any right to employment or continued employment
or to a particular term or condition of employment with Parent, the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates and (y)
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to amend, modify, or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 7.09(c) shall affect the obligations
between Parent and the Company under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.10 Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) by each individual who is or will be

transactions provided for in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
any Contract entered into after the execution of this Agreement between Parent
or any member of the Parent Group, on the one hand, and any Third Party, on
the other hand, that has the effect of causing a Takeover Statute (including
Section 1090.3 of the OGCA) to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or

transaction contemplated hereby (the "Transaction Litigation"). The Company
and Parent shall give each other the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement and/or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation;
provided, that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or Company
Representative shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have
consented in writing; provided, further, that after receipt of Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and, if

take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment and shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would or would reasonably be expected to (w) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (x)
impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (y)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments
(provided that Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Financing Commitment
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date of
this Agreement so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Financing

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitment
(including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Financing Commitment) and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder,
(iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (or terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub (in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms and conditions in the Debt
Financing Commitment), (iv) in the event that all conditions in the Debt
Financing Commitment (other than the availability or funding of any Equity
Financing) have been satisfied, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
Closing and (v) subject to compliance with the requirements of Section
10.09(b), enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment in the event
that all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment (other than the
availability or funding of any Equity Financing) have been satisfied, to cause
the lenders and other persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing
Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice
(containing a reasonable description of the circumstances giving rise to the
notified matter): (A) of any material breach or material default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material
default) by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or definitive document
related to the Debt Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware; (B)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
party to the Debt Financing Commitment with respect to any breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing; and (C) if Parent or Merger Sub will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing; provided, that the Parent and Merger
Sub shall be under no obligation to disclose any information that is subject
to attorney client or similar privilege, but only if such privilege is
asserted in good faith. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment, Parent shall, if requested by the Company, use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement upon terms and conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole,
to Parent and Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those in
the Debt Financing Commitment as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date. To the extent Parent, at the Company's request, seeks to
arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources
and such actions by Parent are determined to have constituted a breach of the
Debt Financing Commitment, the Company agrees that such result shall not be
deemed to be a breach by Parent of its obligations under this Section 7.18 or
otherwise under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 7.18 or in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required (x) to amend or waive any of the terms or
conditions hereof or (y) consummate the Closing any earlier than the final day
of the Marketing Period.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Equity Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment and
shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision or remedy under the Equity Financing Commitment without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or
waivers would or would reasonably be expected to (w) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Equity Financing, (x) impose new or additional conditions to the
receipt of the Equity Financing, (y) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Equity Financing Commitment, including (i)
maintaining in effect the Equity Financing Commitment and (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
in the Equity Financing Commitment and otherwise complying with their
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (containing a
reasonable description of the circumstances giving rise to the notified
matter): (A) of any material breach or material default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material
default) by any party to the Equity Financing Commitment; (B) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any party to the
Equity Financing Commitment with respect to any breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Equity Financing Commitment of the Equity
Financing Commitment or any provisions of the Equity Financing Commitment; and
(C) if Parent or Merger Sub will not be able to obtain all or any portion of
the Equity Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 7.18 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action
against the counterparties to the Financing Commitments to enforce its
respective rights under the Financing Commitments, except that Parent shall
seek enforcement of the Financing Commitments solely if the Company seeks and
is granted a decree of specific performance after all conditions to the
granting therefor set forth in Section 10.09(b) of this Agreement have been
satisfied, (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than those
counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Commitments or (iii) pay any fees in connection with the Financing in
excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments (whether to secure
waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained (other
than as provided in Section 9.01(d)(i)), by written notice (other than
termination pursuant to Section 9.01(a)) by the terminating party to the other
parties specifying the subsection of this Section 9.01 pursuant to which such
termination is effected:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company (upon approval of the Special
Committee) and Parent;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2011
(as may extended in accordance with this Section 9.01(b)(i), the "Outside
Date"); provided, further that (x) if the Marketing Period has commenced on or
before such Outside Date, but not ended before any such Outside Date, such
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by one month and (y) the Outside
Date shall not occur sooner than three (3) Business Days after the final day
of the Marketing Period; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of, or failure to fulfill any obligation under, this
Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Merger to be consummated on or before such date; provided further that in the
event the Company has brought any litigation seeking to enforce any of its
rights under Section 10.09 and such litigation is pending as of the Outside
Date, Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.01(b)(i) until the third Business Day immediately following the
date on which Parent and Merger Sub have complied with all orders (if any)
included in the final ruling (including any appeals) on the merits of such
litigation that is issued by the courts in which such litigation is pending;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) if (x) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable or (y) any
Law makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited (unless
the consummation of the Merger in violation of such Law would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect); provided, however, that no party hereto
shall have such right to terminate pursuant to this Section 9.01(b)(ii)
unless, prior to such termination, such party shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to oppose any such Order or Law or to have such Order or Law
vacated or made inapplicable to the Merger and shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under Section 7.04; provided further
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement results in the imposition of any such Order or the failure
of such Order to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable; or

  

  

(iii) if at the Company Shareholders Meeting (or any adjournment thereof), a
proposal to adopt this Agreement shall have been voted upon by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and the Company Shareholder Approval shall not
have been obtained.

  

  

(c) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.03(a) or 8.03(b) and
(y) (1) is incapable of being cured or (2) if capable of being cured, is not
cured by the earlier to occur of thirty (30) calendar days (or, in the case of
a breach of Section 6.02, five (5) calendar days) after the Company receives
notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub and the Outside Date;
provided, however, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is not then in breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01,
8.02(a) or 8.02(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(ii) if, prior to the obtaining of the Company Shareholder Approval, (A) the
Company Board or the Special Committee shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or the Company Board or the Special Committee shall have
effected a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event; or
(B) Parent shall have received written notice from the Company to the effect
that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 6.02(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the
Company Board or the Special Committee shall have determined, in good faith,
that an Alternative Transaction Proposal is a Superior Proposal and the
Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 6.02 and Section
9.02(b);

  

  

(ii) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.02(a) or 8.02(b) and
(B) (1) is incapable of being cured or (2) if capable of being cured, is not
cured by the earlier to occur of (x) thirty (30) calendar days after Parent or
Merger Sub receives notice of such breach from the Company and (y) the Outside
Date; provided, however, that the Company is not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01,
8.03(a) or 8.03(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(iii) if (A) the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.03 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), (B) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that all conditions set forth in Section 8.02 have been satisfied or
that it is willing to waive all unsatisfied conditions in Section 8.02
provided that the Closing occurs by the close of business on the second
Business Day following the date of such notice, (C) the Marketing Period has
ended or will end on the date of such notice, and (D) by the close of business
on the second Business Day after the Company has delivered written notice to
Parent of the satisfaction of such conditions and such confirmation, the
Merger shall not have been consummated; provided that such conditions in
Sections 8.01 and 8.03 remain satisfied and the Company's certification
remains in full force and effect at the close of business on such second
Business Day; provided, further, that during such period of two (2) Business
Days, no party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(b)(i) until after the close of business on the Business Day
immediately following the last day of such period.

  

  

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, other than Section 4.18, Section 5.08, the
last sentence of Section 7.03, the last sentence of Section 7.11(a), Section
7.11(b), Section 7.11(c), this Section 9.02, and Article X; provided, however,
that no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability for
damages to any other party resulting from any material and willful breach by
such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee shall survive
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Company Termination Fee.

$21,500,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") prior to such termination by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Fund Manager
(except that if the Fund Manager shall not have so designated one or more
accounts to the Company by 12:00 pm, New York City time, on the final day of
the Notice Period, the Company shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(i) without paying the Company Termination Fee
prior to such termination; provided, that the Company shall thereafter pay the
Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager within two (2) Business Days of
the later to occur of (A) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(d)(i) and (B) the date that the Fund Manager shall have
designated such account or accounts to the Company).

  

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.01(c)(ii), the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to the Fund
Manager promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date
of such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Fund Manager.

  

  

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(iii) and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting the Company Board
has made a Change of Recommendation based on an Intervening Event, the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Fund Manager promptly, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Fund Manager.

  

  

(iv) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement (and in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(iii), prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting (or any adjournment thereof)) an Alternative Transaction
Proposal shall have become publicly known and not withdrawn, (B) thereafter,
this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(i), (2) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(iii), or
(3) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(i), and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for
any transaction contemplated by any Alternative Transaction Proposal
(regardless of when made) (which transaction is thereafter consummated) or
consummates any Alternative Transaction Proposal (regardless of when made),
then the Company shall, on the date such Alternative Transaction Proposal is
consummated, pay the Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager; provided
that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section 9.02(b)(iv), the term
"Alternative Transaction Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in Section
6.02(i)(i) except that all references to "twenty (20) percent or more" shall
be deemed to be references to "fifty (50) percent or more" .

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

In no event shall the Company Termination Fee be paid more than once.

  

  

(c) Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.01(d)(ii) or Section 9.01(d)(iii), Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Company a fee equal to $50,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"),
in each case promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days following
such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Company.

  

  

(ii) In no event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(iii) If Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 9.02(c), the Company agrees that its right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee
shall be its sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, the Parent Group and
the Lender Identified Persons and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee,
neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group nor any Lender Identified
Person shall have any liability or obligation to the Company relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Lender Identified Person is an express third party beneficiary of this Section
9.02(c)(iii).

  

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) (A) Section
9.01(b)(i) and, as of the date of such termination, (1) all of the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
all of which would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of
such termination (except that the condition set forth in Section 8.02(d) would
fail to be satisfied as of such date)) and (2) Parent shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations contained in Section 7.14 or (B)
either Section 9.01(b)(iii) or Section 9.01(c)(i) and (ii) under circumstances
in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section
9.02(b), then the Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for all reasonably
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources (including
commitment fees), experts, consultants and the costs of all filing fees and
printing costs) incurred by the Parent Group in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby ("Parent Expenses") by payment to the
Fund Manager of the amount thereof by wire transfer of same day funds as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business
Days following request therefor), which amount shall not be greater than
$5,000,000; provided, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 9.02(d) shall be credited against any amount that may
become payable pursuant to Section 9.02(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Each party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
9.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
(ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.02(c) are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements
contained in this Section 9.02, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 9.02(b) or if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 9.02(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 9.02(b) or Section
9.02(c) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set
forth in or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent
shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the prevailing party and its
Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

  

  

Section 9.03 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before the Effective Time; provided, that after receipt of Company
Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of
such shareholders; provided, further that no amendment of Section 7.06 or the
second sentence of Section 10.06 (to the extent such sentence refers to
Section 7.06 or Section 10.12(c)) shall be effective against any Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

  

  

Section 9.04 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may, and in the case of the Company upon the approval of the Special
Committee, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso in the
first sentence of Section 9.03, and to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

Section 10.06 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,

intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein), each of
Parent and the Company hereby agrees that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement and no provision of this Agreement is intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and the Lender Identified

Identified Person have any liability or obligation under this Agreement.

order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties agree that, prior to the valid termination of this

have been satisfied or waived, (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.02, (C) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being

confirmed that (1) all conditions set forth in Section 8.02 have been
satisfied or that it is willing to waive any of the conditions to the extent

the sources of Debt Financing to fully enforce such sources' obligations
thereunder and Parent's and Merger Sub's rights thereunder shall be subject to

Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur and (D) all conditions to
the consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment (other than the receipt of the Equity Financing and those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
each of which, including the receipt of the Equity Financing, shall be capable
of being satisfied on the Closing (and shall be satisfied on the Closing
Date)) have been satisfied and remain satisfied.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

the Parent Termination Fee (the "Parent Liability Limitation"), and in no
event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek, obtain or accept, or
permit to be sought (and no liability shall attach to the any member of the
Parent Group with respect to), any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect or punitive damages, under or in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor or any other member of the Parent Group, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against the
Guarantors or any other member of the Parent Group, by the enforcement of any

GUARANTEE

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

LIMITED GUARANTEE

  

  

LIMITED GUARANTEE, dated as of January 30, 2011 (this "Limited Guarantee"), by
MidOcean Partners III, L.P., MidOcean Partners III-A, L.P. and MidOcean
Partners III-D, L.P. (collectively, the "Guarantors"), in favor of Pre-Paid
Legal Services, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company").

  

  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Limited
Guarantee, MidOcean PPL Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), PPL
Acquisition Corp., an Oklahoma corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used, but not defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement)
pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Guarantors are entering into this Limited Guarantee as an inducement
to and a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into the Merger
Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Limited Guarantee, the parties agree as
follows:

  

  

1. Limited Guarantee. To induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Guarantors, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to the Company the due and punctual payment by Parent and Merger Sub of, and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to punctually pay and perform, when due pursuant to the terms and condition of the Merger Agreement of (1) the Parent Termination Fee, when required to be paid by Parent pursuant to Section 9.02(c) of the Merger Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 9.02(c) and the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and (2) any reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to Sections 7.11(a) and (c) of the Merger Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"); provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Limited Guarantee (except the immediately succeeding proviso), the Merger Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, in no event shall the aggregate liability of the Guarantors pursuant to this Limited Guarantee exceed $50,000,000 (such amount, plus the aggregate amount to which the Company shall be entitled pursuant to Section 10 of this Limited Guarantee being, the "Maximum Liability Cap"), it being understood that in no event shall this Limited Guarantee be enforced without giving effect to the Maximum Liability Cap. The Company hereby agrees that (i) the Guarantors shall in no event be required to pay an aggregate amount in excess of the Maximum Liability Cap under or in respect of this Limited Guarantee (or in the case of each Guarantor, its Pro Rata Amount of the Maximum Liability Cap), and (ii) neither the Guarantors nor any Guarantor Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) shall have any obligation or liability to any person relating to, arising out of or in connection with, this Limited Guarantee, other than as expressly set forth herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

2. Nature of Guarantee; Waivers.

  

  

(a) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the
Guaranteed Obligations in the event Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the
Company to so file shall not affect any Guarantor's obligations hereunder. In
the event any payment theretofore applied by the Company to the Guaranteed
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever (including by reason of the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of Merger Sub or any Guarantor), such Guaranteed Obligations
shall, for the purposes of this Limited Guarantee, to the extent that such
payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in
existence, notwithstanding such application by the Company, and this Limited
Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
as to such Guaranteed Obligations, all as though such application by the
Company had not been made.

  

  

(b) Each Guarantor agrees that the Company may, in its sole discretion, at any
time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of such
Guarantor, extend the time of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, and may
also make any agreement with Parent or Merger Sub for the extension or renewal
thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or affecting such
Guarantor's obligations under this Limited Guarantee or affecting the validity
or enforceability of this Limited Guarantee. Each Guarantor agrees that the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged,
in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Company
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Guarantor or any other Person interested in
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) any change in the
time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement made in
accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii)
the addition, substitution, discharge or release of any Person interested in
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) any change in the
corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Guarantor; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or any other Guarantor; (vi) the
lack of enforceability of the Merger Agreement (in each case against any
Person other than the Company); (vii) except as otherwise provided herein, the
existence of any claim, set-off or other right that such Guarantor may have at
any time against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Guarantor, whether in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; (viii) the adequacy
of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the
Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Guarantor
hereby expressly waives any rights and defenses arising by reason of any
applicable Law that would otherwise require any election of remedies by the
Company. Each Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence in collection or
protection of or realization upon any Guaranteed Obligations, notice of the
acceptance of this Limited Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other
notices of any kind, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Guarantor, and all suretyship and guarantor defenses generally
(other than fraud or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its
Affiliates, defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are
available to Parent under the Merger Agreement or breach by the Company of
this Limited Guarantee). Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Each Guarantor hereby
covenants and agrees that is shall not assert, directly or indirectly, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to assert, in any proceeding that this Limited
Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Limited Guarantee, the Company
hereby agrees that (i) each of the Guarantor may assert, as a defense to, or
release or discharge of, any payment by such Guarantor under this Limited
Guarantee, any claim, set off, deduction, defense or release that Parent or
Merger Sub could assert against the Company under the terms of, or with
respect to, the Merger Agreement and (ii) any failure by the Company to comply
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including any breach by the Company of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained therein or in
any of the agreements, certificates and other documents required to be
delivered by the Company pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
(whether any such breach results from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
otherwise), that would relieve each of Parent and Merger Sub of its
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or any obligations to pay any fees, costs or expenses under the
Merger Agreement shall likewise automatically and without any further action
on the part of any Person relieve the Guarantors of their obligations under
this Limited Guarantee.

  

  

3. Continuing Guarantee; Primary Obligations. This Limited Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in full. Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, this Limited Guarantee is a primary and original obligation of each Guarantor, is not merely the creation of a surety relationship, and is an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectibility and shall (a) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns and (b) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company and its successors and permitted assigns against each Guarantor and its successors and permitted assigns. Each Guarantor agrees that it is directly liable to the Company and that a separate action may be brought against each Guarantor, irrespective of whether such action is brought against Parent or Merger Sub or whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined in such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Limited Guarantee shall terminate and the Guarantors shall have no further obligations under this Limited Guarantee as of the earliest of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms under circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement in which Parent would not be obligated to pay any Guaranteed Obligation, and (iii) the 90th day after any termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms under circumstances in which Parent would be obligated to pay any Guaranteed Obligation if the Company has not presented a claim for payment of any Guarantee Obligation to Parent or any Guarantor by such 90th day; provided, that, such claim shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of Section 1 hereof or that any other provisions of this Limited Guaranty are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, that the Guarantors are liable in excess of or to a greater extent than the applicable amount of the Guaranteed Obligations or asserting any theory of liability against the Guarantors or the Guarantor Affiliates of the Guarantors with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement other than liability of the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee (as limited by the provisions of Section 1 and Section 9), then (i) the obligations of the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee shall terminate ab initio and shall thereupon be null and void, (ii) if any Guarantor has previously made any payments under this Limited Guarantee, it shall be entitled to recover such payments from the Company, and (iii) no Guarantor shall have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under this Limited Guarantee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

4. No Recourse. The Company agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Guarantors has any obligations hereunder and that, notwithstanding that Guarantors may be limited partnerships, the Company hereunder has no remedy, recourse or right of recovery against, or contribution from, (i) any former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, officer, member, manager, director, employees, agents, controlling persons, assignee or Affiliates of any Guarantor, (ii) Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any lender or prospective lender, lead arranger, arranger, agent or representative of or to Parent or Merger Sub or (iv) any former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, officer, member, manager, director, employees, agents, attorneys, controlling persons, assignee or Affiliates of any of the foregoing (those persons and entities described in the foregoing clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) being referred to herein collectively as "Guarantor Affiliates"), through any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise, except for its rights against the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee; provided, however, that in the event any Guarantor (i) consolidates with or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person such that the sum of all of such Guarantor's remaining net assets plus uncalled capital is less than such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share of the Guaranteed Obligations, then, in each such case, the Company may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by virtue of any statue, regulation or other applicable law, against such continuing or surviving entity or such Person (in either case, a "Successor Entity"), as the case may be, but only to the extent of the unpaid liability hereunder up to the portion of amount of the Guaranteed Obligations for which such Guarantor is liable, as determined in accordance with this Limited Guarantee. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the term Guarantor shall include such Guarantor's Successor Entity.

  

  

5. No Waiver; Cumulative Rights. No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed it by Law (and not limited by this Limited Guarantee) shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Company's rights or remedies against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person liable for the Guaranteed Obligations prior to proceeding against the Guarantors hereunder and the failure by the Company to pursue rights or remedies against Parent or Merger Sub shall not relieve Guarantors of any liability hereunder and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of Law, of the Company. The Company shall have the right to seek recourse against Guarantors to the fullest extent provided for herein, and no election by the Company to proceed in one form of action or proceeding, or against any Person, or on any obligation, shall constitute a waiver of the Company's right to proceed in any other form of action or proceeding or against any other Person unless the Company shall have expressly waived such right in writing. Nothing in this Limited Guarantee shall affect or be construed to affect any liability of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

6. No Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligation under or in respect of this Limited Guarantee or any other agreement in connection therewith, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or such other Person, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract or Law, including the right to take or receive from Parent, Merger Sub or such other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts that may be payable under this Limited Guarantee shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash or otherwise fully performed. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts that may be payable under this Limited Guarantee, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Company, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Company in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts that may be payable under this Limited Guarantee, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and herewith, whether matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee thereafter arising.

9. Relationship of the Parties. Each party acknowledges and agrees that (a) this Limited Guarantee is not intended to, and does not, create any agency, partnership, fiduciary or joint venture relationship between or among any of the parties hereto and neither this Limited Guarantee nor any other document or agreement entered into by any party hereto relating to the subject matter hereof shall be construed to suggest otherwise, and (b) the obligations of each of the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee are solely contractual in nature.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  

  


 

  

  

OF

  

  


 

  

  

[SURVIVING CORPORATION]

  

  

For the purposes of establishing a corporation for the transaction of the
business and the promotion and conduct of the objects and purposes hereinafter
stated under the provisions and subject to the requirements of the Oklahoma
General Corporation Act, as it may be amended from time to time (hereinafter
referred to as the "Act"), the undersigned does make and file this Certificate
of Incorporation and does hereby certify as follows:

  

  

FIRST: The name of the Corporation is:

  

  

[Surviving Corporation]

  

  

SECOND: The duration of the Corporation is perpetual.

  

  

THIRD: The address of its registered office in the State of Oklahoma is 115
S.W. 89th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 731139-8511. The name of its
registered agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

  

  

FOURTH: The nature of the businesses or purposes to be conducted or promoted
are:

  

  

To conduct any lawful business, to exercise any lawful purpose and power, and
to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be
organized under the Act, and in general, to possess and exercise all the
powers and privileges granted by the Act or by any other law of Oklahoma or by
this Certificate of Incorporation together with any powers incidental thereto,
so far as such powers and privileges are necessary or convenient to the
conduct, promotion or attainment of the businesses or purposes of the
Corporation.

  

  

FIFTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is One Hundred (100) shares, all of which shall be Common
Stock. The par value of each such share of Common Stock is One Cent ($.01),
amounting in the aggregate to One Dollar ($1.00) of capital. Each share of
Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote, in person or by
proxy, on any matter upon which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

  

  

SIXTH: (1) Indemnity for Third Party Actions. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good
faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
such person's conduct was unlawful.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(2) Indemnity for Action by or in right of Corporation. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation against expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in
good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation
unless and only to the extent that the court in which such suit or action was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court
shall deem proper.

  

  

Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time
of such repeal or modification.

  


 

  

SEVENTH. (1) To the fullest extent that the Act as it existed on [INSERT DATE
OF CLOSING OF MERGER] (the "Effective Date"), permits the limitation or
elimination of the liability of directors, no director of this Corporation
shall be liable to this Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to or repeal of this
Article SEVENTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any director of this Corporation for or with respect to any acts
or omissions of such director occurring prior to the time of such amendment or
repeal.

  

  


 

  

(2) If the Act is amended after the Effective Date to further limit or
eliminate liability of this Corporation\'s directors for breach of fiduciary
duty, then a director of this Corporation shall not be liable for any such
breach to the fullest extent permitted by the Act as so amended. If the Act is
amended after the Effective Date to increase or expand liability of this
Corporation's directors for breach of fiduciary duty, no such amendment shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
director of this Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to the time of such amendment or otherwise
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of this Corporation
existing at the time of such amendment.

  

  

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision
contained herein, to add any additional provisions hereto, to increase or
decrease the number of authorized shares of stock, or to restate this
Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by the Act.
