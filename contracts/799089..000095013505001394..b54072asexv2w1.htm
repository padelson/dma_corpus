Within three business days or as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. The
Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement
and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to
the stockholders of the Company to occur on the 10th calendar
day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, the first
business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately
following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the
SEC or if not practicable, then as promptly as practicable
thereafter. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of
the Company and Parent shall

furnish all information concerning such person to the other as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company (i)&nbsp;shall provide Parent
an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response, (ii)&nbsp;shall include in such document or response
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii)&nbsp;shall
not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If at any time
prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to
the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

(b)&nbsp;The Company agrees that none of the information
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments
or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of
the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except
that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion or
incorporation for reference therein. Parent agrees that none of
such information will (except to the extent revised or
superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at
the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to
the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c)&nbsp;The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the &#147;<U>Stockholders
Meeting</U>&#148;), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the
Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer
advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company

occurred at any time; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Company may extend the date of the Stockholders Meeting to the
extent (and only to the extent) (i)&nbsp;necessary in order to
obtain a quorum of its stockholders and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly
as practicable or (ii)&nbsp;the Company reasonably determines
that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply with
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the
Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section&nbsp;4.02(b)(i), the

the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii)&nbsp;seeking to impose limitations on the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or hold,
or exercise full rights of ownership o f, any shares of Company
Common Stock or any shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, including the right to vote the Company Common
Stock or the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation

other as is reasonably required to obtain any such nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in
connection therewith, shall notify the other person promptly
