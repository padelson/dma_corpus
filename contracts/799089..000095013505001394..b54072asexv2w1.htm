 ARTICLE II 

  

  _Conversion of Securities_  

  

  Section 2.01. _ _Conversion of Capital Stock.__ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub: 

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and 
outstanding share of common stock of Sub, par value  $0.01 per share, shall
be converted into and become one  fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
      
      |   (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned 
Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as  treasury stock
by the Company or owned by Parent or Sub  immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be  canceled and retired and shall cease to exist
and no  consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange 
therefor.  
      
      |   (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share 
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  to the
Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled  and retired in
accordance with Section 2.01(b),  (ii) the Appraisal Shares and (iii)
Restricted Shares  to the extent set forth in Section 5.04(a)(iii)) shall
be  converted into the right to receive $18.50 in cash, without  interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the  Effective Time such shares shall no
longer be outstanding and  shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and  each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the 
Effective Time represented any such shares (a  " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights  with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration. The right of any holder of any share of Company 
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be  subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is  required under applicable
tax Law.  
    

  Section 2.02. _ _Exchange of Certificates.__ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent. 

  

  (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and which the Company shall reasonably approve)  ##### 

  

 and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate. 

  

  (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

  (d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

  (e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration. 

  

  (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

  (g) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL  ##### 

  

 (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), without interest. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of
any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals
of any such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 ARTICLE III 

  

  _Representations and Warranties_  

  

  Section 3.01. _ _Representations and Warranties of the Company.__ Except as set forth in the Company Letter (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure relates, _provided_ that disclosure in any section of such Company Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows: 

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each 
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation  duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the  Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization (except, in the  case of good standing, for entities
organized under the Laws of  any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept),  (ii) has all requisite corporate, company or partnership  power
and authority to carry on its business as now being  conducted and (iii) is
duly qualified or licensed to do  business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction (except,  in the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that
does not  recognize such concept) in which the nature of its business or 
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such 
qualification or licensing necessary or desirable, other than  where the
failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or  licensed or in good
standing (except in the case of  clause (i) above with respect to the
Company), individually  or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have
a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available
to  Parent copies of the Company Certificate and the Second Amended  and
Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company  Bylaws_ ") and the
certificate of incorporation and  bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of each of its  Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date

representatives copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft  minutes, the
most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the  stockholders, the Board
of Directors and each committee of the  Board of Directors of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries  held since January 1, 2002.  
      
      |   (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the  Company
Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of each  Subsidiary and its
place of organization. All the outstanding  shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests  in, each such Subsidiary are owned by the
Company, by one or  more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company or by the
Company  and one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company, free  and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, options to  purchase,  ##### 

        |

nature  whatsoever other than Taxes not yet due and payable  (collectively,
" _Liens_ "), except for transfer  restrictions imposed by applicable
securities Laws and are duly  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Except  for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests  in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or 
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests in,
any person.  
      
      |   (c) _Capital Structure._ (i) The authorized  capital
stock of the Company consists of 125,000,000 shares  of Company Common Stock
and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred  Stock, par value $0.01 per share of the
Company (the  " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of  business on
March 10, 2005, (A) 59,656,675 shares  of Company Common Stock (excluding

Company (" _Restricted Shares_ "),  (B) 10,258,428 shares of Company Common
Stock were  held by the Company as treasury shares,  (C) 11,955,673 shares

Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Statutory  Stock Option and Award Plan
(together with any other stock  options granted after the date of this
Agreement under the  Company Stock Plans pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or  the Company Letter, the " _Stock Options_ ") (such  plans,
together with the ESPP, the " _Company Stock  Plans_ ") and (D) 1,169,854
shares of Company  Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance
pursuant  to the ESPP. Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no 
Contract, plan or other arrangement providing for the grant of  options

of its Subsidiaries. No shares of Company  Preferred Stock are issued or
outstanding. No shares of Company  Common Stock are owned by any Subsidiary.
The Company has made  available to Parent (A) a complete and accurate list,

the name of the holder thereof and  (B) a complete and accurate list, as of
the close of  business on March 10, 2005, of all Restricted Shares, the 
grant dates, the names of the holders thereof and the form of  Restricted
Share grant agreement pursuant to which all  Restricted Shares were granted

EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the " _Company Rights  Agreement_ "), there
are no outstanding rights of any  person to receive Company Common Stock
under the Company Stock  Plans or otherwise, on a deferred basis or
otherwise. As of the  close of business on March 10, 2005, there were
outstanding  rights to purchase 49,680 shares of Company Common  Stock under
the ESPP (assuming the fair market value per share  of Company Common Stock

period ending  prior to the date of this Agreement, the aggregate amount 
credited to the accounts of participants in the ESPP was  $663,398.31.  
      
      |   (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i), as of

        |   
---|--- 
      |   other rights to acquire any such stock or securities or
other  similar rights that are linked to the value of the Company  Common
Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof, in  any such case
whether or not granted in tandem with a related  Stock Option, were issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding.  Since March 10, 2005, until the date
of this Agreement,  (A) there have been no issuances by the Company of
shares  of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the 
Company other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock  pursuant to
the exercise of Stock Options or rights under the  ESPP, in each case
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement  and only if and to the extent
required by their terms as in  effect on the date of this Agreement and (B)
there have  been no issuances by the Company of options, warrants, shares
of  deferred stock, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation  rights,
phantom stock awards, other rights to acquire shares of  capital stock or
other equity or voting interests from the  Company or other rights that are
linked to the value of Company  Common Stock or the value of the Company or
any part thereof,  other than rights under the ESPP.  
      
      |   (iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the 
Company are, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the  Company Stock
Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the  terms thereof, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights. There are no  (A) bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (B) except as

exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any  matters on
which stockholders of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries may vote.
Except (A) as set forth above, and  (B) for rights under the ESPP, the
Company Rights Agreement  or the Stock Options in effect as of the date of
this Agreement  there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, 
commitments, agreements, instruments, arrangements,  understandings,
obligations, undertakings or other Contracts to  which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or by  which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound,  obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue,  deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, 
additional shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or  obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue,  grant, extend or enter into any such security,
option, warrant,  call, right, commitment, agreement, instrument,
arrangement,  understanding, obligation, undertaking or other Contract. As
of  the date of this Agreement and without giving effect to  Section
5.04(a), each Stock Option intended to qualify as  an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of  the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of
each other Stock  Option is no less than the fair market value of a share
of  Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such  Stock
Option. Except for the Restricted Shares in effect as of  the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual  obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to  (A) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of  capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) vote or dispose  of any
shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests in, any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company is not a  party to any voting agreements
with respect to any shares of the  capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of the  Company, as of the date of this Agreement there are no 
irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any  shares of
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests in, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.  
      
      |   (iv) All Stock Options and Restricted Shares may be
treated  in accordance with Section 5.04(a).  
      
      |   (v) As of the date of this Agreement and excluding any 
indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary to any Subsidiary  and any
indebtedness of any Subsidiary to the Company, neither  the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any  (A) indebtedness for borrowed money, (B)
amounts  ##### 

        |

obligation of a type described in  clauses (A) through (D) above of any other
person  (other than, in the case of clauses (A) through (D),  accounts
payable to trade creditors and accrued expenses arising  in the ordinary
course of business) (collectively,  " _indebtedness_ ").  
      
      |   (d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has the 
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver  this
Agreement, to consummate the Merger (subject to obtaining  the Stockholder
Approval) and to comply with the provisions of  this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by  the Company, the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and  the compliance by the Company with the provisions
of this  Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate 
action on the part of the Company and no other corporate  proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to  authorize this Agreement, to comply
with the terms of this  Agreement or to consummate the Merger, subject, in
the case of  the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. This 
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company  and, assuming
the due execution and delivery of this Agreement  by Parent and Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of  the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with  its terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited  by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance,  reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to
the  enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general  principles
of equity. The Board of Directors of the Company, at  a meeting duly called
and held at which all directors of the  Company were present, duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions  (i) approving and declaring advisable the

result in any violation or breach of, or  default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under,  or give rise to a right of, or result in,

state a  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in  order
to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which

consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates  thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash  flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of  unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit

liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether  accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) which individually  or in the aggregate have had, or
are reasonably likely to have,  a Material Adverse Effect.

any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or  any similar Contract
(including any Contract relating to any  transaction or relationship between

unconsolidated  affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or  limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand or any  "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in  Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC)), where the  result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid 
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material  liabilities
of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the  CompanyÂ’s or such
SubsidiaryÂ’s published financial  statements or other SEC Documents.  
      
      |   (v) The CompanyÂ’s system of internal controls over 
financial reporting is reasonably sufficient in all material  respects to
provide reasonable assurance (A) that  transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of  financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (B)

reasonably designed in all  material respects to ensure that (A) information
(both financial  and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company
in  the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is 
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time  periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and  (B) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to  the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to
allow timely  decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications
of  the principal executive officer and principal financial officer  of the
Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to  such reports.  
      
      |   (f) _Information Supplied._ None of the information 
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement  will, at the
date it is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s  stockholders, at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting or at the  time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which  they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation is  made by the Company
with respect to statements made or  incorporated by reference therein based
on information supplied  by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by  reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement
will  comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements  of

respects with all  applicable Laws and Judgments. The execution and delivery

Merger and compliance with the terms of this Agreement are  not reasonably
likely to, cause the revocation or cancelation of  any material Permit,
except for Permits with respect to which  the Company furnishes Parent
written notice following the date  of this Agreement which is sufficiently
timely for Parent to  prevent any such revocation or cancelation. As of the
date  hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  received
any written communication during the past three years  from any person that

as a single employer under  Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or 
any other applicable Law (each, a " _Commonly Controlled  Entity_ "), in each
case, providing benefits to any  Company Personnel, but not including the
Benefit Agreements (all  such plans, arrangements and understandings,
including any such  plan, arrangements or understanding entered into or

Pension Plans are made or  the basis on which such contributions are
determined.  
      
      |   (ii) There are no collective bargaining or other labor 
union agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  is a party
or by which it is bound. Since January 1, 2002,  neither the Company nor any

material respect with any Environmental Law or subject to  potential
liability under any Environmental Law, including  potential material
liability for the costs of investigating or  remediating contaminated
property pursuant to the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, or  analogous state Law; (iv) as of the date of this
Agreement,  for the last four years there have been no material Releases of 
Hazardous Substances on, at, under or about any properties then  owned,
leased or operated by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, and during
such period neither the Company nor any  of its Subsidiaries has Released,
disposed of or arranged for  the disposal of Hazardous Substances at any on-
site or off-site  location; and (v) to the knowledge of the Company, as of 
the date of this Agreement there are no facts, circumstances or  conditions

Subsidiaries in connection  with any Environmental Law. For purposes of this
Agreement, the  term " _Environmental Claim_ " shall mean any and  all
administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits,  orders, demands,

      |   (m) _ERISA Compliance._   (i) Section 3.01(m)(i) of the
Company Letter sets  forth a complete and accurate list of all "employee
welfare  benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  (" _ERISA_ ")), "employee
pension benefit  plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (each, a  "
_Pension Plan_ ") and all other Benefit Plans and  Benefit Agreements that
are in effect as of the date of this  Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent copies of  (A) each Benefit Plan and each Benefit
Agreement (or, in  the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit
Agreements,  descriptions thereof), (B) the two most recent annual  reports
on Form 5500 required to be filed with the Internal  Revenue Service (the "
_IRS_ ") with respect to  each Benefit Plan (if any such report was required
under  applicable Law), (C) the most recent summary plan  description for
each Benefit Plan for which a summary plan  description is required under
applicable Law and (D) each  trust agreement and group annuity contract
relating to any  Benefit Plan. Each Benefit Plan has been administered in
all  material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable  Law,
including ERISA and the Code.  
      
      |   (ii) All Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified
have  been the subject of determination letters from the IRS with  respect
to all tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS is  currently willing to
provide a determination letter to the  effect that such Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from  United States Federal income Taxes under Sections
401(a)  and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no determination  letter
has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement,  has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since  the date of the most recent
determination letter or application  therefor relating to any such Pension
Plan that is reasonably  likely to adversely affect the qualification of such
Pension  Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or require security 
under Section 307 of ERISA. All Pension Plans required to  have been approved
by any foreign  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Governmental Entity have been so approved, no such approval
has  been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has  revocation
been threatened) and no event has occurred since the  date of the most recent
approval or application therefor  relating to any such Pension Plan that is
reasonably likely to  affect any such approval relating thereto or increase
the costs  relating thereto. The Company has made available to Parent a 
copy of the most recent determination or approval letter  received with
respect to each Pension Plan, as well as a copy of  each pending application
for a determination or approval letter,  if any.  
      
      |   (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled 
Entity has maintained, contributed to or been obligated to  maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent  liability under, any Benefit
Plan that is subject to  Title IV of ERISA or is otherwise a defined benefit
pension  plan or that provides for the payment of termination indemnities.  
      
      |   (iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides 
welfare benefits (each, a " _Welfare Plan_ ") is  funded through a "welfare
benefits fund" (as such term  is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code), or
is  self-insured. There are no understandings, agreements or  undertakings,
written or oral, that would prevent any Welfare  Plan (including any Welfare
Plan covering retirees or other  former employees) from being amended or
terminated without  material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on  or at any time after the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan 
provides benefits after termination of employment, except where  the cost
thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or  his or her eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) or as required  by Section 4980B(f) of the
Code.  
      
      |   (v) Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter sets  forth
a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this  Agreement, of (A) each
Benefit Plan and each Benefit  Agreement pursuant to which any Company
Personnel could become  entitled to any additional compensation, severance or
other  benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting  of
any compensation, severance or other benefits as a result of  the Merger
(alone or in combination with any other event), or  any benefits the value of
which would be calculated on the basis  of the Merger (alone or in
combination with any other event),  (B) the names of all Company Personnel
entitled to  severance benefits actually payable as of the Closing Date or 
upon termination of employment after the Closing Date pursuant  to any
employment, severance, termination or change in control  agreement or
arrangement between the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and such Company Personnel, on  the other hand, (C) the category or type of
each such  severance, termination or change in control benefit to which 
such Company Personnel is entitled, (D) the aggregate value  of each such
severance, termination or change in control benefit  actually payable as of
the Closing Date and each such severance,  termination or change in control
benefit that would be payable  upon termination of employment after the
Closing Date and  (E) the aggregate value of severance that would be paid
to  each individual set forth in Section 3.01(m)(v) of the  Company Letter
upon termination of employment based on the terms  of any severance plan or
plans applicable to such individual in  effect at the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that in no event shall Section 3.01(m)(v) of the
Company  Letter be required to set forth (I) any payments  attributable to
the accelerated vesting of outstanding Stock  Options or the conversion of
outstanding Restricted Shares, in  each case, in accordance with Section
5.04(a), or  (II) any obligation to pay cash severance of an amount that  is
not more than $50,000 to any Company Personnel who is not an  officer or
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except  as set forth in Section
3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter,  no Company Personnel will be entitled to
any additional  compensation, severance or other benefits or any acceleration
of  the time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance or  other
benefits as a result of the Merger (alone or in  combination with any other
event) or any benefits the value of  which will be calculated on the basis of
the Merger (alone or in  combination with any other event). Except as set
forth in  Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter, the execution and 
delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger  (alone or in
combination with any other event) and compliance by  the Company with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and  will not (A) entitle any Company
Personnel to severance,  termination or change in control or similar
benefits,  (B) trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or  otherwise)
of any compensation, severance or other benefits or  the  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any Company Personnel to
the  Company or any of its affiliates, (C) increase the cost of  any Benefit
Plan, Benefit Agreement or any other employment  arrangement or (D) result in
any violation or breach of, or  a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both)  under, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.  
      
      |   (vi) The deduction of any amount payable pursuant to
the  terms of the Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements will not be  subject
to disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Code.  
      
      |   (vii) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of, and, 
to the knowledge of the Company, there are no, pending  investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or  pending termination proceedings or
other material claims (except  claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the  Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving
any  Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement or asserting any rights or  claims to
benefits under, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.  
      
      |   (viii) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments 
under or in connection with the Benefit Plans or Benefit  Agreements that are
required to have been made by the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries have
been timely made. No Pension Plan  has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as such term  is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of  the
Code), whether or not waived.  
      
      |   (ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has 
not occurred any prohibited transaction in which the Company,  any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,  directors or employees or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any  trustee or other fiduciary or
administrator of any Benefit Plan  or trust created thereunder, in each case,
who is not an  officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries (a " _Non-Affiliate Plan  Fiduciary_ "), has engaged that is
reasonably likely to  subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their  respective officers, directors or employees or any Non-Affiliate 
Plan Fiduciary, to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions  imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions  imposed under Title I of ERISA or
any other applicable Law  and (B) none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of  their respective officers, directors or employees,
or, to the  knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, any 
Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary, nor any agent of any of the  foregoing, has
engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner,  or failed to act in a
manner, that is reasonably likely to  subject the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company or, to the  knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, any  Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to any liability for breach of 
fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law.  
      
      |   (x) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any 
liability or obligations, including under or on account of a  Benefit Plan or
Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of  persons to provide services
to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries and treating such persons as
consultants or  independent contractors and not as employees of the Company
or  any of its Subsidiaries.  
      
      |   (n) _Taxes._ (i)Each of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries has timely filed all material Tax Returns required  to be filed
by it and all such Tax Returns are complete and  accurate in all material
respects. Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries has timely paid all
material Taxes due and owing,  and the most recent financial statements
contained in the Filed  SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all
material Taxes  payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable 
periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial 
statements.  
      
      |   (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, no material Tax 
Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently  under audit or
examination by any taxing authority, and no  notice of such an audit or
examination has been received by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
There is no material  deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or
matter in  controversy with respect to any Taxes due and owing by the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each deficiency resulting  from any
completed audit or examination or concluded litigation  relating to Taxes by
any Taxing Authority has been timely paid.  As of the date of this Agreement,
no issues relating to Taxes  were raised by the relevant Taxing Authority
during any  presently pending audit or examination, and no issues relating ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Taxes were raised by the relevant Taxing Authority in any 
completed audit or examination, that are reasonably likely to  recur in a
later taxable period, except for issues that  individually or in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to  result in a material liability for
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  
      
      |   (iii) There is no currently effective agreement or
other  document extending, or having the effect of extending, the  period of
assessment or collection of any material Taxes and no  power of attorney
(other than powers of attorney authorizing  employees of the Company to act
on behalf of the Company) with  respect to any material Taxes has been
executed or filed with  any taxing authority.  
      
      |   (iv) No material Liens for Taxes exist with respect to
any  assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  except

appropriate proceedings and for which  adequate reserves have been
established.  
      
      |   (v) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a 
party to or bound by any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity  obligation or
similar agreement, arrangement or practice with  respect to material Taxes

Taxing  Authority).  
      
      |   (vi) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will
be  required to include in a taxable period ending after the  Effective Time
a material amount of taxable income attributable  to income that accrued (for
purposes of the financial statements  of the Company included in the Filed
SEC Documents) in a prior  taxable period but was not recognized for Tax
purposes in any  prior taxable period as a result of the installment method
of  accounting, the completed contract method of accounting, the  long-term
contract method of accounting, the cash method of  accounting or Section 481
of the Code or comparable  provisions of any Tax Law, or for any other reason
(including as  a result of prepaid amounts or deferred revenue received on
or  prior to the Effective Time).  
      
      |   (vii) Other than payments that may be made to persons
set  forth on Section 3.01(n)(vii) of the Company Letter (the  " _Primary
Company Executives_ "), no amount or  other entitlement that could be
received (whether in cash or  property or the vesting of property) as a
result of the Merger  by any Company Personnel who is a "disqualified 
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury  Regulation Section
1.280G-1) under any Benefit Plan,  Benefit Agreement or other compensation
arrangement would be  characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as 
such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and  no such
disqualified individual is entitled to receive any  additional payment (e.g.,
any tax gross up or other payment)  from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any other person  in the event that the excise tax required
by  Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such disqualified  individual.
The Company Letter sets forth a complete and  accurate list of the CompanyÂ’s

      |   (viii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
in  all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the  payment

      |   (o) _Properties._ (i) The Company and each of its 
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or in the case of  leased

      |   (q) _State Takeover Statutes; Company Certificate._  
The approval of the Merger by the Board of Directors of the  Company referred

restrictions would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement,  the Merger or

and (C) the Company Rights to purchase Series A  Participating Preferred
Stock issued under the Company Rights  Agreement do not become exercisable,
in the case of  clauses (A), (B) and (C), solely by reason of the  execution
of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or  compliance with the
terms of this Agreement and  (iii) provide that the "Expiration Date" (as 
defined in the Company Rights Agreement) shall occur immediately  prior to
the Effective Time.  
      
      |   (s) _Voting Requirements._ The affirmative vote at the 
Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof  of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock in
favor of adopting this Agreement (the  " _Stockholder Approval_ ") is the
only vote of the  holders of any class or series of the CompanyÂ’s capital 
stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement or the  consummation of
the Merger.  
      
      |   (t) _Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses._ No

provided Parent with complete and accurate copies of  all agreements under
which any such fees or commissions are  payable and all indemnification and
other agreements related to  the engagement of the persons to whom such fees
are payable. The  fees and expenses of any accountant, broker, financial
advisor,  consultant, legal counsel or other person retained by the  Company

by the Company in connection with this  Agreement and the Merger will not be
inconsistent with the fees  and expenses set forth in Section 3.01(t) of the
Company  Letter.  
      
      |   (u) _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ The Board of 
Directors of the Company has received the written opinion of  Deutsche Bank

this Agreement,  and based upon and subject to the limitations,
qualifications  and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
to  be received by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this 
Agreement is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of  view, a
copy of which letter the Company has disclosed to Parent.  #####

relating to the  enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general 
principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and compliance by  Parent and Sub with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and  will not conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of,  or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both)  under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination,  cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of
a  material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in  or upon
any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub under,  or give rise to any

ability  of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this 
Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay  the
consummation of the Merger. No consent, approval, order or  authorization of,
registration, declaration or filing with, or  notice to, any Governmental

the  Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State  of
Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant  authorities of other
states in which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business and (iii) such  other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, 
registrations, declarations, filings and notices, the failure of  which to be
obtained or made individually or in the aggregate is  not reasonably likely
to impair in any material respect the  ability of each of Parent and Sub to
perform its obligations  under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede
or  materially delay the consummation of the Merger.  
      
      |   (c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information

terms that are substantially equivalent to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated February 4, 2005, between Parent and the Company (as it may
be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); 
_provided_ that all such information had been or is provided on a prior or
concurrent basis to Parent and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations

of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02(a)
by the Company. 

  

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub) relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 15% or more of the total revenue, net income or operating assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses referred to in clause (i) above, in each case other than the Merger. 

  

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide binding written offer not solicited after the date of this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by a third party which, if consummated, would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise. 

  

  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action or any such resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ), (ii) adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum  #####

agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting
or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a)) or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject
to Section 4.02(c), if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in its good faith judgment that the failure to
take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof, as applicable, may (and may agree or resolve to) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company promptly and in any event within 24 hours shall advise Parent of any request for information that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. On a daily basis, the Company will (i) advise Parent regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by Parent and the material details (including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent with copies of all documents and written communications relating to such Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the one hand, and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the other hand. 

  

  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b). 

  

  Section 4.03. _ _Conduct by Parent.__ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, take any action that is reasonably likely to result in (a) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.
