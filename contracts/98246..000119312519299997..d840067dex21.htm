evidence, if any, of such surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), as applicable, such materials to be in such form and have such other

be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
two (2) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Per Share Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with this _Article IV_ shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit,
in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by
Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such
Certificate, issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) equal to the product
obtained by  _multiplying_ (i) the number of Eligible Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent (and any of their Affiliates) shall be
entitled to (i) deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts (x) shall be timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (y) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

4.3  _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the per-share exercise price
for such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Shares
underlying such Company Option (the " _Company Option Consideration_ ");
_provided_ that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be canceled without any cash payment or other consideration
being made in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company
Option the Company Option Consideration (if any), less any required
withholding Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the sum of (A) any accrued but unpaid cash in respect of dividend
equivalent rights representing fractional Shares with respect to such Company
PSU  _plus_ (B) the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company PSU (including for the avoidance of doubt any dividend equivalent
units credited in respect of Company PSUs) immediately prior to the Effective
Time,  _multiplied by_ (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the "
_Company PSU Consideration_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company
PSU the Company PSU Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes, within
two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time; _provided_ that to the
extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the
earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

 

(c) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the sum of (A) any accrued but unpaid cash in respect of dividend
equivalent rights representing fractional Shares with respect to such Company
RSU  _plus_ (B) the product of (i) the total number of Shares underlying such
Company RSU (including for the avoidance of doubt any dividend equivalent
units credited in respect of Company RSUs), _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Company RSU Consideration_ "). The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent
applicable) to each holder of a Company RSU the Company RSU Consideration,
less any required withholding Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following

such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not

(d) _Company Actions; Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
Board or a committee thereof shall have adopted resolutions to approve the

Company Equity Awards held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the
Laws of a country other than the United States, the

 



19

    

 Parties shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to
minimize the Tax impact of the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
4.3_.

 

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, from the date of this Agreement to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article_ ___IX_ , the issued and outstanding Shares or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of Shares or securities or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
with a record date within such period shall have been declared, then the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders
of Shares as well as Parent, Holding and Merger Sub the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company or any other Person to take any
action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by,
the terms of this Agreement.

 

4.5 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its full right, title or interest in, and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of
the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized in the name and behalf of the Company or
otherwise to take all such lawful actions as may be necessary or desirable to
accomplish such purpose or acts or to carry out this Agreement.

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of
its respective Organizational Documents, except, in the case of the

business on the Capitalization Date, there were outstanding (1) Company
Options to purchase an aggregate of 2,385,796 Shares, (2) Company PSUs

after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) based on the information then available, including the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and those of this Agreement, failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ that prior to engaging or otherwise
participating in any such discussions or negotiations with or furnishing any
information to such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_. The Company acknowledges and agrees
that any action, that if taken by the Company would be a breach of this

Company.

any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits
the Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and
other information.

7.2(e)_, the Company Board, including any committee thereof, shall not:

consultation 

 



48

    

 with outside legal counsel) is bona fide and that did not arise from or in
connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.2_ is received by the Company after the date of this Agreement and is not
withdrawn prior to the Change of Recommendation, and the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event has
occurred, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or (B) take action to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to, and in accordance with, _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is bona fide and that did not arise from or in
connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.2_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (2) failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Change of Recommendation or
action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ may not
be made (i) unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and (ii) unless and until
the Company has given Parent written notice of such action four (4) Business
Days in advance (an " _Initial Notice_ "), setting forth in writing that the
Company Board intends to consider whether to take such action, the reasons
with respect thereto and (I) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (II) in the case of an
Intervening Event, a reasonable description of such Intervening Event (it
being agreed that, in each case, the delivery of such notice by the Company
shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation). After giving such Initial
Notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or taking such
action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, the
Company shall, and shall instruct its legal and financial advisors to,
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives throughout such
four (4) Business Day period (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to
make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that the failure of
the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation or to take such action
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ would no
longer be reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.
At the end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect a Change of Recommendation or taking action to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, the Company Board shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
writing and any other information offered by Parent in writing in response to
the Initial Notice, and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal,
and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in each case, if
such changes offered in writing were to be given effect. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ except that the
obligation to give advance written notice with respect thereto as set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that any
"stop look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall include an affirmative
statement to the effect that the Company Recommendation is affirmed or remains
unchanged; and _provided_ , _ further_ , that if any such disclosure or
communication has the substantive effect of withdrawing, qualifying or
modifying the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, such
disclosure or communication shall 

 



49

    

 constitute a Change of Recommendation unless the Company expressly reaffirms
the Company Recommendation in such disclosure or communication.

 

(f) _Standstill Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend
or otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any such
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

7.3 _Proxy Statement; Other Regulatory Matters_.

(a) _Proxy Statement_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any
event within fifteen (15th) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, a proxy statement (as amended
or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Except under the circumstances
expressly otherwise permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement upon reasonable request of
the Company and furnish all information concerning Parent as reasonably
requested by the Company.

(ii) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Proxy
Statement will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that none of the information supplied by it, any of its
controlled Affiliates or their respective Representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or of filing with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent, its controlled Affiliates or
their respective Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement and (2) Parent, Holding and Merger Sub assume no
responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company, its controlled Affiliates or their respective Representatives for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

(iii) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, any of their respective
Affiliates or their respective directors, officers or Representatives, should
be discovered by a Party, which information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable following such
discovery notify the other Party or Parties (as the case may be) and after
such notification the Company shall (A) prepare (with the assistance of
Parent) an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and (B) cause the
Proxy Statement as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicably thereafter and to be disseminated to
its stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
prior to filing, furnishing or delivering such documents with the applicable
Governmental Entity and disseminating the Proxy Statement (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) to the stockholders of the Company or
responding to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the
Company shall (A) provide Parent and its outside legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of such documents
or communications related to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (B)
consider in good faith for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (and any amendment
or supplement thereto) and such other documents and 

 



50

    

 communications related to the Company Stockholders Meeting (including with
respect to any comment letters from the SEC) all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent and its outside legal counsel and the Company agrees that all
information relating to Parent, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of the receipt of all comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional material information and shall promptly provide to
Parent copies of all written correspondence between the Company and/or any of
its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the
Proxy Statement from the SEC. Except in connection with a Change of
Recommendation, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made
by the Company without the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
stockholders of the Company as of the record date established for the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ") as promptly as practicable after
the date on which the SEC confirms orally or in writing, that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement or that it does not intend to review
the Proxy Statement (the " _Proxy Statement Clearance Date_ ").

(b) _Other Regulatory Matters_.

 

(i) In addition to and without limiting the rights and obligations set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(ii)_, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
other and use (and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to use)

request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and (2) any
other notifications required or advisable under applicable Antitrust Laws.

offered by the Company and its Subsidiaries or facilities owned or leased by
the Company or its Subsidiaries; and

With respect to obtaining clearance under any applicable Antitrust Laws,
"reasonable best efforts" shall include (i) taking or committing to take
actions that may limit or impact Parents or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries) freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries)
operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, contracts, customers or
assets, (ii) entering into any orders, settlements, undertakings, contracts,
consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements to effectuate any of the

information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, any of
their respective controlled Affiliates and any of their respective
Representatives, that appears in any presentation or filing made with, or

7.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary, in accordance with applicable
Law and its Organizational Documents, to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable (but in
no event later than thirty-five (35) days) after the Proxy Statement Clearance
Date, to secure the Requisite Company Vote in respect of the approval of
the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement, and to cause such vote to be
taken. The Company shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except
if (i) as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the definitive Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) in order

 



52

    

 to establish a quorum or to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, (ii) the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary under applicable Law to comply with the
requirements made by the SEC or other applicable Law with respect to the Proxy
Statement or that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (iii) with prior consent
of Parent; _provided_ that in no event will the Company postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting (x) in the case of clause (i), by more than
ten (10) days in connection with any one postponement, recess or adjournment
or more than an aggregate of twenty (20) days from the original date; or (y)
in the case of clause (ii), by more than ten (10) Business Days or such other
amount of time reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent to be necessary to
comply with applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of
clause (i) the Company shall, and shall instruct its proxy solicitor to use
reasonable best efforts to, solicit as promptly as practicable the presence,
in person or by proxy, of a quorum, but shall only be obligated to do so in
the absence of the Change of Recommendation and until there are a sufficient
number of Shares present or represented to obtain such a quorum, and in no
event more than ten (10) days after the date originally scheduled for the
Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, at the instruction of Parent,
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if there are not
sufficient votes in person or by proxy to secure the Requisite Company Vote
to allow reasonable time (but in no event more than twenty (20) days) for the
solicitation of proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote. The Company will establish the earliest reasonable Record Date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, subject to compliance with the DGCL, the
Exchange Act or the rules or regulations of any national securities exchange
(including Euronext Paris), national securities or interdealer quotation
system (including any listing agreement related thereto). In no event will the
Record Date be changed without Parents prior written consent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ shall not be
affected by commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication
to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any event constituting or that
could constitute an Intervening Event.

(b) Subject to the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under applicable Law,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote, including the solicitation of proxies therefor.

7.5 _Information and Access; Consents_.

(a) The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), at Parents
reasonable request, upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable
Law, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal

termination of this Agreement, to its employees, agents, properties, offices
and other facilities, Contracts, books and records and (promptly following the
execution of a consent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
auditors or independent accountants) accounts and work papers of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries independent accountants and auditors, and
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent all other information and documents concerning
or regarding its businesses, properties and assets (including Intellectual
Property Rights) and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such
access or furnish such information and documents to the extent the Company
reasonably determines (upon the advice of outside legal counsel) that such
access or furnishing of information could result in (A) a violation of any
applicable Law or Contract or (B) waiver of the protection of any attorney-
client privilege or protection (including attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protections and confidentiality protections); _provided_ that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts (A) to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege (or such other protection) or (B) to develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
are reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company.

 

(b) To the extent that any of the information or documents furnished or
otherwise made available pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or otherwise
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement constitutes information or documents that may be subject to an
attorney-client privilege or protection 

 



53

    

 (including attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protections and
confidentiality protections) or any other applicable privilege or protection
concerning pending or threatened Proceedings, the Parties understand and
agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters
and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of
such material and information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its
continued protection under such privileges and protections.

 

(c) No access or information provided to Parent or any of its Representatives
or to the Company or any of its Representatives following the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or otherwise, shall
affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the Parties set forth in this Agreement and, for the avoidance
of doubt, all information and documents disclosed or otherwise made available
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange or sharing of information and any restrictions or requirements
imposed by any Governmental Entity.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and Subsidiaries to (i) use
their respective reasonable best efforts (which efforts shall not require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any consideration, fees or expenses)
to obtain any consents or waivers from any third parties in respect of
any Company Material Contracts which are subject to termination or penalties
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Representatives, to pursue such
consents, including by making their Representatives reasonably available to
meet with such third parties by telephone or in person and facilitating access
to and communications with such third parties.

 

(e) No later than thirty (30) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a true and
complete list of any material Contract in effect as the date hereof, and to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is otherwise bound,
that contains a change of control or similar provision that would require
a payment to, or give rise to the termination and/or consent right of, the
other party or parties in connection with the Merger.

7.6  _Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares and
other securities of the Company under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

7.7 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release. Thereafter,
neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) issue or cause the publication of any press release or otherwise
make any public statements, disclosures or communications with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except (a) as may be required by
any applicable Law or Proceeding or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange (including
Euronext Paris), national securities quotation system, interdealer quotation
service or the NYSE or (b) with respect to any Change of Recommendation made
in accordance with this Agreement or Parents response thereto; _provided_ the
foregoing shall not apply to any public statements, disclosures or
communications, so long as such statements, disclosures or communications are
substantially similar in tone and substance with previous public statements,
disclosures or communications jointly made by the Company and Parent or to the
extent that they have been reviewed and previously approved by both
the Company and Parent and would not otherwise require the other party to
make additional public disclosure.

 



54

    

7.8 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year immediately following the Closing Date (or if
shorter, during the relevant period of employment), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, the Continuing Employees with (i) an annual base
salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target cash
short-term incentive and commission opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based compensation, nonqualified deferred compensation,
defined benefit pensions, and retiree medical arrangements) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) the
severance benefits set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under any employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries solely to the extent such plans provide benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Closing Date (including the Company Benefit
Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each such Continuing Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the foregoing service credit shall
not be required to apply (i) to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (ii)
for purposes of any defined benefit pension accrual under any New Plan (other
than any Company Benefit Plan) and (iii) for purposes of any subsidy provided
for any post-employment welfare benefits under any New Plan (other than any
Company Benefit Plan). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (A) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_"), and
(B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts, cause (x) all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y)
any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Upon the written request of Parent at least thirty (30) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, effective as of immediately prior to Closing Date
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate
or shall cause the termination of the U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution
plan provided to current and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Qualified Plan_ "). In such event, prior to the
Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall
take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S.
tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Qualified Plan_ "), to permit each
Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in
an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company Qualified
Plan to the corresponding Parent Qualified Plan. If the Company Qualified Plan
is terminated as described herein, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible
as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date to commence
participation in a Parent Qualified Plan.

 



55

    

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Parties (to the extent applicable) shall
satisfy all legal or contractual requirements that may apply to them between
the date of this Agreement and Closing to provide notice to, or to enter into
any consultation or bargaining procedure with, any employee or any labor
union, labor organization or works council, which is representing any
employee, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
To the extent applicable, each Party (and each of its respective Subsidiaries)
agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist the other
Party in satisfying information and consultation obligations owed to any
employee, labor union, labor organization or works council in relation to the
Transaction.

 

(e) The Parties shall take the actions set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications
(including website postings) pertaining to employment, compensation or
benefit matters that are or may be affected by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_
are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.8_, express or implied, shall confer upon any current or former director,
officer, employee or natural person service provider of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, or any other
Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever, under this Agreement or any rights or remedies under any
Company Benefit Plan that such employee, representative, beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that Company Benefit Plan.

 

7.9 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) During the Tail Period, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under applicable Law and the Companys Organizational

_provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards

matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated by
this Agreement); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any

Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with the
Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with

to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_; or

(b) prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, there shall
have been a Change of Recommendation or if the Company or any of its
Representatives shall have materially breached any of its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

9.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in _Article IX_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith
be given by the terminating Party to the other Party specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made. Except to the extent
provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, in the event of termination of this
Agreement in compliance with _Article IX_ , this Agreement shall be terminated
and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding
anything to the

 



63

    

 contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) no such termination shall relieve
any Party from any liability or damages for Willful Breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ and (ii) the provisions set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 9.5_ and _Article X_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, a termination fee in the amount of $575,000,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, or
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ and,
in each case;

 

(A) any Person shall have made an Acquisition Proposal to the Company or its
stockholders (whether or not conditional or not withdrawn) or publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not
withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and

 

(B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (with "fifty percent (50%)" being substituted in lieu of "fifteen
percent (15%)" in each instance thereof in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)(i)(B)_), then
immediately prior to or concurrently with the occurrence of such entry into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or

 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, then promptly, but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination; or

(iii) by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, then
simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the effectiveness of any such
termination.

In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, in
the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without this agreement, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the fees set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
9.5_ or any portion of such fees, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
9.5_ from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the annual rate of two percent (2%) _plus_ the prime lending rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment (or such lesser rate as is
the maximum permitted by applicable Law). Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, other than in the case of actual or intentional fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company and subject to _Section_ __ _
10.6_, the Parties agree that in the event this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent, Holding and Merger Sub, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective directors, officers, employees and stockholders and Affiliates (the
" _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result
of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, other than in the case of actual
or intentional 

 



64

    

 fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the Parties agrees that, except as specifically set forth
in any commitment letter or definitive financing agreement to the contrary,
all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to
the Financing or the performance thereof or the financing contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,

agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
Proceeding in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or in such other

service thereof and (F) agrees that it shall not assert as a defense any
matter or claim waived by the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5(a)_ or that any Order issued by the Chosen Courts may not
be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any Proceeding brought in the Chosen Courts shall be conclusive
and binding upon each of the Parties and may be enforced in any other courts
the jurisdiction of which each of the Parties is or may be subject, by suit
upon judgment. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source in any way

THE FINANCING OR ANY FINANCING COMMITMENT), ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT
DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES THAT (I) NO

67

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company

Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein (including with respect to the Financing). The Company and its
Affiliates hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Financing
Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any
Financing commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

10.6 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that irreparable harm would
occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached or threatened
to be breached and for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other available
remedies a Party may have in equity or at law, each Party shall be entitled
to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
to obtain or to seek an injunction restraining any breach or violation or
threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement,
consistent with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.5(a)_, in the Chosen
Courts without necessity of posting a bond or similar instrument. In the event
that any Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the
defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law, and any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any bond or similar
instrument.

10.7 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) from and after the Effective
Time, the Indemnified Parties with respect to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 7.9_ as provided for therein and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Shares, Company Options, Company PSUs and Company RSUs shall be
third-party beneficiaries with respect to their respective rights to receive
the consideration payable pursuant to _Article_ ___IV_ , the Parties hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person (other than the Parties and those
Persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, but
only to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement) or their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns any rights
or remedies, express or implied, hereunder, including the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party
beneficiaries of, and are entitled to enforce,  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_, _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ and
_Section_ __ _ 10.8_.

 

10.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Except as may be required to satisfy
the obligations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.8_, no Party may assign any
of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted or purported
assignment or delegation in violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ shall be
null and void.

10.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and Exhibits) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous
agreements, negotiations, understandings, representations and warranties,
whether oral or written, with respect to such matters.

10.10  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision to be
negotiated by the Parties, each acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may

 



68

    

 be legal, valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such legal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall
such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any other jurisdiction.

10.11 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by email or other means
of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as
delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. This Agreement shall
become effective when each Party shall have received one or more counterparts
hereof signed by each of the other Parties and unless and until such receipt,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication).
