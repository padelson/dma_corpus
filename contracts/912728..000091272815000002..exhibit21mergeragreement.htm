Delaware corporation ("MergerCo"), ZM PRIVATE EQUITY FUND I, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership, solely in the capacity of the representative of the
holders of the Common Stock (the "Equity Holders' Representative"), and the
parties set forth on the signature pages hereto as stockholders of the Company
solely for the purposes of agreeing to the provisions of Sections 2.8, 6.3(a),
6.8, 6.9 and 9.2 and Article VIII hereof (the "Indemnifying Equity Holders").
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are
defined in Section 11.6.

WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company wish to effect a business
combination through a merger (the "Merger") of MergerCo with and into the
Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL");

WHEREAS, Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger are,
among other things, explicitly conditioned on, and this Agreement was entered
into by them in reliance on, their receipt prior to the Closing of executed
Letters of Transmittal in the form attached to this Agreement (and which
include, as a necessary and essential part thereof, certain releases, waivers
and joinders) from stockholders of the Company, and Parent and Merger Sub
would not have entered into this Agreement except for such condition, and if
Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger, they will do so in reliance upon
the validity and enforceability of each and every Letter of Transmittal
(including the releases, waivers and joinders set forth therein) received by
Parent and Merger Sub prior to Closing; and

WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into this Agreement in reliance on
the agreements of the Indemnifying Equity Holders set forth herein, and Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement absent such
agreements of the Indemnifying Equity Holders;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interest
of its stockholders;

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and MergerCo have approved and
adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and have determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interest of their respective
stockholders, and Parent has agreed to approve and adopt this Agreement as the
sole stockholder of MergerCo; and

WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants herein
contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree
as follows:





ARTICLE I - THE MERGER

Section 1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and MergerCo shall consummate
the Merger pursuant to which (a) MergerCo shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall thereupon
cease, (b) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware and (c) the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

Section 1.2. Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, MergerCo and the Company shall
duly execute a certificate of merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "Certificate of Merger") and file such Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger,
accompanied by payment of the filing fee (as provided in the DGCL), has been
examined by and received the endorsed approval of the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").

Section 1.3. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.
As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of MergerCo, the Company or any other Person being required, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated to read the same as the certificate of incorporation of MergerCo as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that Article I
thereof shall read "The name of the corporation is FASBI, Inc." and except
that Article VI shall be deleted and the subsequent articles therein shall be
renumbered accordingly) and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Law and the terms of such certificate of incorporation.
As of the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall have
been amended and restated as contemplated by Section 7.1(u). From and after
the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise
designated in accordance with applicable Law, the directors of MergerCo at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of MergerCo at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each such director and officer to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation as in effect from and after the Effective Time.

Section 1.4. Closing. Unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in
accordance with its terms, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
occur at the offices of Carlton Fields Jorden Burt, P.C., 1201 West Peachtree
Street, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 as of 10:00 a.m. EST on the third
(3rd) Business Day after the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived (other than conditions required to be satisfied at the
Closing); provided that, the foregoing notwithstanding, the Closing may occur
on any other date and/or at any other time agreed upon in writing by the
Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs pursuant to the
foregoing sentence shall be the "Closing Date." The Closing shall take place
via the electronic exchange of signature pages between the parties or in such
other manner as agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. "Business Day"
means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware is closed.









ARTICLE II -EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS; PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK AND OTHER
CLOSING PAYMENTS; APPRAISAL RIGHTS; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS; HOLDBACK AMOUNT

Section 2.1. Effect on Capital Stock and Securities.

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action being required on the part of the holders of any of the capital stock
of MergerCo or the holders of any of the Company Stock (each such holder of
the Company Stock being an "Equity Holder," and all such holders collectively
being the "Equity Holders"):

(i) Each share of common stock of MergerCo that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger.

(ii) Each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Company Stock that is owned by the Company or by any Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(iii) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(a)(ii) above and other than the
Dissenting Shares, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Common Stock Total Merger Consideration
Per Share payable at such times and in such amounts as set forth in this
Agreement.

(iv) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(a)(ii) above and other than the
Dissenting Shares, each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series A Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration Per Share payable as set forth in this Agreement.

(b) All shares of Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section
2.1(a)(iii) above, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate ("Certificate")
previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive that portion of the Common Stock Total Merger Consideration applicable
to the shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate. The holders of
Certificates previously evidencing shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to the Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

(c) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock, when converted as provided in
Section 2.1(a)(iv) above, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate
previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive that portion of the Series A Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
applicable to the shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate. The holders
of Certificates previously evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall have been canceled and terminated in its entirety as
contemplated by Section 7.1(k), and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.



(e) At the Effective Time, each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall have been canceled and terminated in its entirety as
contemplated by Section 7.1(k), and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

Section 2.2. Payment with respect to Shares of Company Stock.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver or mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time will represent outstanding shares of Company Stock: (i) a
letter of transmittal, release, waiver and joinder in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C (the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to Parent and which include, as
an essential and indispensible part thereof, the releases, waivers and
joinders set forth therein; and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates to Parent at or after Closing in exchange for the Merger
Consideration applicable to the shares of Company Stock represented by the
Certificates.

(b) At or following the Effective Time, and upon surrender of a Certificate
representing Company Stock to Parent for cancellation, together with a Letter
of Transmittal or similar instrument approved in writing by Parent properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall pay to (i) each Common
Stockholder, the Common Stock Closing Cash Merger Consideration Per Share (and
shall thereafter pay to such holder any remaining Common Stock Total Merger
Consideration Per Share at such times and in such amounts, if any, as set
forth in this Agreement) for each share of Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, and (ii) each Preferred Stockholder, the Series A Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration Per Share for each share of Series A Preferred Stock
represented by such Certificate. Any Certificate duly surrendered under this
Section 2.2(b) shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any of the Merger Consideration payable to holders of the
Certificates.

(c) Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.2, each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing shares of Company Stock to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Dissenting Shares) shall represent
solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating thereto (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws). If the Merger
Consideration relating thereto (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to
any Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such
Merger Consideration relating thereto that (i) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
(ii) the Person surrendering such Certificate shall pay to Parent any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter, there shall be no further registration or transfers of
shares of Company Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Stock presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall be surrendered and canceled in return for the
payment of the Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this
Article II.

(e) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Equity Holders'
Representative or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact and an indemnity in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent in its
discretion from any holder of more than one percent (1%) of the Company Stock,
a bond in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, Parent will
pay the applicable Merger Consideration as provided by this Agreement in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in accordance with
this Article II.

(g) If Parent is required to make a payment pursuant to Section 2.8(d), Parent
shall promptly distribute all such amounts to the Common Stockholders based on
each such Common Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of such amount.

(h) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Equity Holder such amounts as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state
or local Tax Laws, and shall instead pay such amount to the applicable
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and properly paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Equity Holder in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Reasonably in advance of making any such withholding, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall notify the relevant Equity
Holder of its intention to withhold and whether withholding may be avoided by
the Equity Holder's delivery of any forms or certifications.

Section 2.3. Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Equity Holders who have not executed the Written Consent and who have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Rights Provisions") will not be converted as
described in Section 2.1, but will thereafter constitute only the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Stock in
accordance with the Appraisal Rights Provisions; provided, however, that all
shares of Company Stock held by Equity Holders who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such shares of Company Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been canceled and to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration, without interest, in the manner provided in Sections 2.1
and 2.2. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid as provided in Sections 2.1
and 2.2 of this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided by
the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent and MergerCo prompt notice of, and shall promptly
respond to all inquiries of Parent and MergerCo with respect to, any demands
received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to
shares of Company Stock, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal with
respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Parent.

(b) Each dissenting Equity Holder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving



Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such
Dissenting Shares shall be canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned for any
reason, then the right of a dissenting Equity Holder to be paid the fair value
of their Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease.

Section 2.4. Delivery of Escrow Amount. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause to be delivered to Regions Bank, an Alabama banking corporation (the
"Escrow Agent"), an amount in cash equal to $16,500,000 (the "Escrow Amount"),
such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund"). $2,000,000 of
the Escrow Fund shall be the "Working Capital Portion," and $14,500,000 of the
Escrow Amount shall be the "Indemnification Portion." The Escrow Fund shall be
governed by the terms hereof and the terms of an escrow agreement to be
entered into by and among Parent, the Equity Holders' Representative and the
Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow
and shall be available to settle certain contingencies as provided in Sections
2.8 and 9.2 and Article VIII of this Agreement and will be distributable to
the Common Stockholders and/or Parent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.5. Payments at Closing for Indebtedness. On the Closing Date, Parent
and MergerCo shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all
indebtedness then outstanding under those certain agreements, instruments and
facilities entered into by and among the Company and various lending
institutions, all of such agreements, instruments and facilities being as
described on Schedule 2.5 attached hereto (collectively, the "Indebtedness");
provided that contemporaneously therewith the Company must provide Parent with
executed payoff letters from the lenders of such Indebtedness in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "Payoff Letters"). Parent and
MergerCo, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will cooperate
in arranging for such repayment and shall take such reasonable actions as may
be necessary to facilitate such repayment and to facilitate the release, in
connection with such repayment, of any mortgages, pledges, liens, security
interests, encumbrances, claims, charges, conditional sale agreements and
restrictions of any kind or character (collectively, "Encumbrances") securing
such Indebtedness and to facilitate the delivery of Payoff Letters to Parent
or Parent's lenders.

Section 2.6. Payment at Closing for Expenses. On the Closing Date, Parent and
MergerCo shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (a) all
outstanding fees and expenses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the negotiation and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that have not been paid on
or prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Expenses") and (b) to the members
of management of the Company the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.6 opposite
each such individual's name in respect of their profit participation
agreements disclosed on Schedule 3.8(a) (the aggregate amount of these
payments being the "Management Payment Amounts").

Section 2.7. Estimated Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent and MergerCo a good faith estimate of what the
Company's Net Working Capital will be as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the "Company's Estimated Working Capital"), together with
supporting documentation for such estimate and any additional information
relating thereto reasonably requested by Parent or MergerCo. Parent and its
accountants and advisors shall be given full access to all of the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' books and records for purposes of evaluating the
accuracy and completeness of the Company's Estimated Working Capital. If
Parent believes, in good faith, that the Company's Estimated Working Capital
is in error, Parent may challenge the amount of the Company's Estimated
Working Capital



within the three (3) Business Days that immediately follow the date of
Parent's receipt of the Company's Estimated Working Capital by delivering a
written notice of disagreement to the Company. If Parent does not timely
deliver a notice of disagreement to the Company, the amount of the Common
Stock Closing Cash Merger Consideration to be paid at the Effective Time shall
be based on the Company's Estimated Working Capital as delivered to Parent. If
Parent timely delivers a written notice of disagreement to the Company, Parent
and the Company shall use their good faith efforts to resolve any disputes
with respect to the Company's Estimated Working Capital prior to the Closing
Date, and the amount of Common Stock Closing Cash Merger Consideration to be
paid at the Effective Time shall be based on the Estimated Working Capital (as
defined below) as mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. If
Parent timely delivers a notice of disagreement to the Company, but Parent and
the Company are unable to resolve their dispute regarding the Company's
Estimated Working Capital on or prior to the first Business Day following the
date of delivery by Parent to the Company of such notice of disagreement, then
the amount of Common Stock Closing Cash Merger Consideration to be paid at the
Effective Time shall be based on the average of (i) the Company's Estimated
Working Capital and (ii) the amount of working capital set forth in such
notice of disagreement. "Estimated Working Capital" shall mean the estimate of
the amount of the Company's Net Working Capital as of the close of business on
the Closing Date, as determined pursuant to this Section 2.7(a). All notices
and deliveries to be made by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) shall
be made via email to the addresses set forth in Section 11.1.

(b) The "Target Working Capital" will be $6,460,000. The "Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment" shall be a dollar amount calculated as follows:

(i) If Estimated Working Capital is equal to the Target Working Capital, then
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be zero; or

(ii) If Estimated Working Capital is greater or less than the Target Working
Capital, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to the
amount of Estimated Working Capital determined in accordance with Section
2.7(a) minus the Target Working Capital.

Section 2.8. Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Within one hundred five (105) days following the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Equity Holders' Representative a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business
on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet
will include Parent's good faith calculation of: (i) the Company's actual Net
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing
Working Capital"); and (ii) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment (as defined
below). The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Adjustment,
collectively, are referred to herein as the "Closing Statement." The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"), as applied on a consistent basis, and
consistent with the past practice and the practices, policies and procedures
used in preparation of the Base Balance Sheet (as defined below), and the
Closing Balance Sheet shall be certified by an authorized officer of Parent.
The preparation of the Closing Statement shall be for the sole purpose of
determining the Closing Working Capital Adjustment in accordance with Section
2.8(b). The Equity Holders' Representative shall have thirty (30) Business
Days following its receipt of the Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to
review the same. On or before the expiration of the Review Period, the Equity
Holders' Representative shall deliver to Parent a written statement accepting
or objecting to the Closing Statement. If the Equity Holders' Representative
objects to the Closing Statement, such statement (a "Statement of Objections")
shall include an itemization of the Equity Holders' Representative's
objections and the reasons therefor. The



Equity Holders' Representative shall be deemed to have accepted each item on
the Closing Statement to which the Equity Holders' Representative has not
properly objected during the Review Period.

(b) The "Closing Working Capital Adjustment" shall be an amount calculated as
follows:

(i) If the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was zero, then an amount equal
to the Target Working Capital minus the Closing Working Capital; or

(ii) If the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was positive, then an amount
equal to the Target Working Capital plus the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment minus the Closing Working Capital; or

(iii) If the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was negative, then an amount
equal to the Target Working Capital minus the absolute value of the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment minus the Closing Working Capital.

The Closing Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the Closing Statement, as
accepted or deemed accepted under Section 2.8(a) or, if applicable, as
determined in accordance with Section 2.8(c) below, shall constitute the
"Final Closing Adjustment" for purposes of determining any adjustment to the
Merger Consideration.

(c) If the Equity Holders' Representative delivers a Statement of Objections
within the Review Period, Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative shall
promptly and in good faith attempt to resolve such objections (any such
resolved objections, the "Agreed Adjustments"). Any such objections that
cannot be resolved between Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative (the
"Unresolved Objections") within thirty (30) days following Parent's receipt of
the Equity Holders' Representative's statement of objections shall be resolved
in accordance with this Section 2.8(c). Any Unresolved Objections shall be
submitted to the Chicago, Illinois office of KPMG LLP or another recognized
firm of independent certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement
of the Equity Holders' Representative and Parent (the "Accounting Referee")
for review and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the Accounting
Referee's engagement. The Accounting Referee shall only decide the specific
items under dispute by the parties, and its decision for any Unresolved
Objections must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in
the Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively. The
Accounting Referee shall deliver a statement setting forth its own calculation
of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment, after giving effect to any Agreed
Adjustments, within thirty (30) days of the submission of the matter to such
firm, which calculation, absent manifest error, shall be binding and
conclusive on the parties and not subject to appeal. The parties hereto shall
make available to Parent, the Equity Holders' Representative and, if
applicable, the Accounting Referee such books, records, personnel and other
information as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepare or
review the Closing Statement or any Unresolved Objections submitted to the
Accounting Referee, including work papers prepared by Parent and/or Parent's
accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statement and such
historical financial information (to the extent in Parent's possession and
readily available) relating to the Closing Statement. All fees and costs of
the Accounting Referee, if one is required, shall be payable by the party
whose calculations of the disputed amounts in the aggregate were farthest from
the actual amounts as determined by the Accounting Referee and shall be
payable (i) out of the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Common Stockholders, on
the one hand, and (ii) by Parent, on the other hand.



(d) Payment of the Final Closing Adjustment shall occur as follows:

(i) If the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive amount and is greater than
the Working Capital Portion of the Escrow Fund, then Parent and the Equity
Holders' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent the first $2,000,000 of
the Final Closing Adjustment from the Working Capital Portion of the Escrow
Fund, and the remainder, including all interest earned thereon, shall be
payable to Parent from the Indemnification Portion of the Escrow Fund.

(ii) If the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive amount and is less than the
Working Capital Portion of the Escrow Fund (including all interest earned
thereon), then Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
deliver (A) to Parent the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment, including
all interest thereon, from the Working Capital Portion of the Escrow Fund and
(B) to the Common Stockholders, based on each such Common Stockholder's Pro
Rata Portion, any amount remaining in the Working Capital Portion of the
Escrow Fund, including all interest earned thereon.

(iii) In the event the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then (A)
Parent shall pay to the Common Stockholders, based on each such Common
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion, an amount in cash equal to (x) the Final
Closing Adjustment, plus (y) interest earned on such amount that is accrued
from the Closing Date until the date of determination of the Final Closing
Adjustment, earned at the same rate of interest as was earned on the Escrow
Fund for the same period of time, and (B) Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Common Stockholders, based on each
such Common Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion, the Working Capital Portion of the
Escrow Fund, including all interest earned thereon.

(iv) In the event the Final Closing Adjustment is zero, then Parent and the
Equity Holders' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Common Stockholders,
based on each such Common Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion, the Working Capital
Portion of the Escrow Fund, including all interest earned thereon.

(v) Any payment made under this Section 2.8(d) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

Section 2.9. Holdback Amount. On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
delivered $1,500,000 (the "Holdback Amount") to the Equity Holders'
Representative. The distribution of the Holdback Amount to the Equity Holders'
Representative shall be governed by the terms hereof and the terms of an
agreement to be entered into by and among the Equity Holders' Representative
and the Equity Holders party thereto, such agreement to be in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Equity Holders Agreement"). The Holdback
Amount shall be held by the Equity Holders' Representative and shall be
available to pay (a) the fees, expenses and losses of the Equity Holders'
Representative in connection with the consummation of the Closing and the
obligations of the Equity Holders' Representative hereunder and under the
Escrow Agreement and (b) the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses or other
amounts for which the Indemnifying Equity Holders are liable under this
Agreement, regardless of whether any other Equity Holder is liable therefor.
Any portion of the Holdback Amount not used to pay such fees and expenses
shall be distributed to the Common Stockholders in accordance with the terms
of the Equity Holders Agreement; it being understood and agreed that Parent's
sole obligation with respect to the Holdback Amount shall be Parent's
obligation to pay the Holdback Amount to the Equity Holders' Representative in
accordance with this



Section 2.9 at the Closing, and following such payment, Parent shall have no
further obligation with respect to the payment or delivery of such Holdback
Amount and shall have no liability to any Person if such amounts are not
delivered to the Person or Persons entitled to same by the Equity Holders'
Representative as required.

disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Financial Statements.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(d), (i) there are no loans, leases,

notice from any of its insurance carriers that any premiums will be materially
increased in the future, that any insurance coverage listed on Schedule 3.15
will not be available in the future on substantially the same terms now in
effect (whether due to cancellation, non‑renewal, termination, modification or

or understanding with any Person that may result in the obligation to pay any

enforcement orders, or received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority or any other written notice that indicates non-compliance with any
Legal Requirements, (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under, and no condition exists that with or without notice or lapse of

material Legal Requirement or Company License applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (c) no formal or informal investigation, review or audit
related to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is being (or since January

review is scheduled, pending or threatened, and (d) there has not been, since
January 1, 2012, nor are there currently, any internal investigations or

fraud, violation of policy, misconduct or willful or negligent wrong doing
with respect to financial, accounting or Tax matters or matters involving
conflicts of interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or negligent conduct or other
misfeasance or malfeasance with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board

each of them not subject to (i) the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL,
(ii) any other Takeover Law or (iii) any provision of the governing documents
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that would require any corporate approval
other than that otherwise required by the DGCL or other applicable state Law.
The approval of the Common Stockholders holding a majority of the Common
Stock, as shall be set forth in the Executed Consent, is the only vote of any
class or series of the Company's Securities required to approve this

restrictions contained in any Takeover Law or any anti-takeover provision in
the governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has in effect any "poison pill" or shareholder rights plan. "Takeover Law"
means any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination,"
"fair price" or other form of anti-takeover Law of any jurisdiction or other
applicable Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the
ability to acquire or to vote the Securities of the Company.

those funds; (ii) holds, or is required to hold, in trust for any Owner-

obligated on an account in respect of such Owner-Operator's services; or (iii)
has any fiduciary relationship or duty to any driver arising out of or in
connection with any contract between the Company or its Subsidiary and such
Owner-Operator. No Owner-Operator, whether pursuant to contract or otherwise,
at any time controls the method of collection of the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' accounts or restricts the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
use of proceeds related thereto. No Owner-Operator, whether pursuant to
contract or otherwise, at any time has the right to seek payment from, or
otherwise has recourse to, any Person obligated on an account for payables by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Owner-Operator. All payments by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of payables to Owner-Operators,
whether pursuant to contract or otherwise, are made from the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' general funds in the ordinary course of business.

(b) Each contract between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and its Owner-Operators, on the other hand, (the "Owner-Operator
Contracts") complies in all material respects with the federal truth-in-
lending regulations set forth in 49 C.F.R. Part 376, and all payments,
deductions, chargebacks and other actions of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with regard to its Owner-Operators have complied in all material respects with
the terms and conditions of such contracts and regulations. All Owner-
Operators have executed and delivered to the Company or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, and all Owner-Operators that perform services in connection with
the Company Business are subject to and bound by, the



form of agreement attached hereto as Schedule 3.26(b). Schedule 3.11(e)(ii)
includes a true and complete list of all of the Owner-Operators, as of the
date of this Agreement. The operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have, since January 1, 2011, been consistently conducted (i) in compliance
with the regulations promulgated by the FMCSA under 49 CFR 376.12 et seq., and
(ii) in a manner consistent with the criteria to establish and maintain

and the Owner-Operators under the applicable company's DOT operating authority
and all applicable Legal Requirements.

(c) Each of the Owner-Operator Contracts (i) complies in all material respects
with all Laws, (ii) has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company or its Subsidiary and, to the Company's Knowledge, the respective
Owner-Operator, (iii) is in full force and effect and is valid and enforceable
in accordance with its terms in all material respects, and (iv) does not
require the consent of any Person in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the Company's Knowledge, no
event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or
lapse of time) would be reasonably expected to contravene, conflict with or
result in a breach of, or give the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
other Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or
to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or payment under, or to modify
any Owner-Operator Contract.

(d) Schedule 3.26(d) is a correct and complete listing as of December 31, 2014
of (i) all of the escrowed funds held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for each Owner-Operator Contract, all of which are accurately
reflected on the Base Balance Sheet, and (ii) any amounts owed to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under each Owner-Operator Contract as of December
31, 2014 in accordance with the terms of such Owner-Operator Contract.

(e) Schedule 3.26(e) is a correct and complete listing as of December 31, 2014
of all Owner-Operators for whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provide
financing, along with a description of the financing terms (purchase or
lease), outstanding balance, monthly payment, maturity date, balloon or
purchase option amount, any late fees, penalties or similar amounts due and
whether all payments are current. All of such financing arrangements are
authorized under express terms of the Owner-Operator Contract with each
applicable Owner-Operator or otherwise represented by written contracts.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of the intention of its Owner-Operators to, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no Owner-Operators intend to, cease doing business or reduce the
business transacted with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time as a result of the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.27. Exclusive Dealing. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.27, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, is a party to any currently effective agreement involving,
directly or indirectly, the sale or transfer of any Securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than inventory in the ordinary course) to any Person other
than Parent.

Section 3.28. Limitations on Warranties. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement (including, without limitation, this Article III and Section 9.1),
and except with respect to matters involving fraud, the Company and the Equity
Holders disclaim all liability and responsibility for any representation,
warranty, or statement made or information communicated (orally or in writing)

advice which may have been provided to Parent, MergerCo or any of their
Affiliates by the Company, any Equity Holder or the Equity Holders'
Representative). ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE



ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. ANY AND ALL PRIOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE

its assets are subject or bound; (ii) violate any provision of the

either case, would be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to

Consent"). Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, the

(f) Subject to Section 6.3(b), between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' officers, employees and agents to give Parent
and MergerCo and their authorized representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance notice and at Parent's expense during normal business
hours, to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective facilities,
properties, employees, books and records, systems, software, intellectual

fiduciary duty. The Company and Parent, with the assistance of their
respective counsel and advisors, as appropriate, shall collaborate with each
other, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in (A) determining

the consequences described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.2(b) and

Company or any Indemnifying Equity Holder of any liability arising under

Affiliates and their respective employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel
and other representatives and advisers to, hold in strict confidence and not
divulge or disclose any information of any kind concerning this Agreement, the
Merger, Parent, MergerCo, the Company and their respective Affiliates, except

Corporation), the Equity Holders' Representative, any Indemnifying Equity
Holder or any of their respective Affiliates and their respective employees,
agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives and advisers are
compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or
by other requirements of Law, such Person shall promptly notify Parent in
writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information which such

efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.

by other requirements of Law, except for any such disclosure that may be
required by federal or state securities Laws, such Person shall promptly
notify the Company in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such
information which such Person is advised by its counsel in writing is legally
required to be disclosed, provided that such Person shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a party is making or
defending a claim in connection with this Agreement (an "Agreement Claim"),
such party may make disclosures to its attorneys and advisors and to any court
or arbitrator in any legal proceeding or arbitration in connection with any
litigation or arbitration related to such Agreement Claim, but only to the
extent necessary in making or defending such Agreement Claim; provided,
however, that the disclosing party shall remain liable for any unauthorized
disclosure of information by its attorneys and advisors and, to the extent
reasonably possible, all such litigation or arbitration of an Agreement Claim
shall be conducted under seal or subject to a protective order.



Section 6.4. Consents. Subject to Section 10.1(b)(i), each of the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals from any Governmental Authority or other Person
which are required for or in connection with the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents. Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon the reasonable request
of the other party, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other
and its Affiliates in obtaining such consents, orders and approvals; provided,
however, that such efforts shall not be deemed to include a request that any
party pay any amounts or take any actions outside the ordinary course of
business, including any divestiture or holding separate of assets. Each of the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents as promptly as
practicable, including to obtain the consents and approvals of the third
parties listed on Schedule 7.1(g) and executing and delivering all agreements
and documents required by the terms hereof to be executed and delivered by
such party on or prior to the Closing.



Section 6.5. Employment Matters.

(d) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated, or shall have
caused its Subsidiaries to have terminated, all Plans, except for those Plans
that Parent requests not be terminated. Parent shall take all necessary action
so that, after the Effective Time, any current or former employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who is eligible to participate in a Plan as of the
Effective Time shall either be eligible to continue his or her participation
in such Plan or participate in a corresponding employee benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to the terms of such
corresponding plan. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties,
within fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide
written notification to the Company of the Plans to be terminated and Plans to
be maintained post-Closing. Parent shall determine which current or former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue participation in a
Plan after the Effective Time and which will commence participation in a
corresponding employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time and, with respect to current or former
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who transfer participation to
such a corresponding plan, when such transfer will occur. Parent need not
treat all current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including those who are similarly situated) in the same manner with respect
to which plans they participate in and when, if at all, they transfer
participation from a Plan to a corresponding employee benefit plan maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent may take such actions (or cause
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time to take
such actions) as are necessary or advisable to accomplish the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5(a), Parent hereby
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to grant employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries credit for any service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries earned prior to the Closing Date for eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual purposes, including with respect to vacation accrual, Parent's
401(k) Plan and Parent's medical, dental, vision and other benefit plans
maintained by Parent at the Effective Time, to the same extent such service
was recognized under a similar Plan, except, in each case, to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits. In addition, Parent shall
cause (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any applicable plans maintained by Parent to the same
extent such conditions were not applicable under any Plan and (ii) any covered
expense incurred on or before the Closing Date by any current or former
employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of pocket provisions after
the Closing Date under any applicable plan maintained by Parent.

(e) Effective no later than the last day of the regularly scheduled payroll
period immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the
freeze of contributions to the Towne Air Freight, Inc. Employees Retirement
Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the 401(k) Plan shall be terminated by proper
action of the board of directors of Towne Air Freight, Inc., which shall
provide that, after the date of plan termination, no new participants shall
become eligible to participate in, and no contributions shall be made on
behalf of existing participants to, the 401(k) Plan, and that all plan assets
shall be liquidated as soon as practicable after plan termination, but not
necessarily on or before the Closing Date. Before the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent copies of duly adopted resolutions by the board
of directors of Towne Air Freight, Inc. freezing contributions to the 401(k)
Plan, terminating the 401(k) Plan, and authorizing the liquidation of plan
assets. The resolution shall be subject to the prior review of Parent.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the 401(k) Plan to the contrary,
on or before the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be contributed or,
in lieu thereof, for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital, cause to
be accrued for the contribution of, all unpaid employer contributions
(including matching contributions) to the 401(k) Plan.



(f) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.5, nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any particular Plan or Benefit Program or as
requiring the Surviving Corporation or Parent to offer to continue (other than
as required by its terms) any Plan, any Benefit Program or any written
employment contract or to continue the employment of any specific person;
provided, however, that no such termination or amendment may take away
benefits or any other payments already accrued as of the time of such

(y) The Equity Holders' Representative shall have full power and authority to
take all actions under this Agreement and any other Transaction Document that
are to be taken by the Equity Holders'



Representative, and Parent shall not be required to obtain the consent of any
or all Equity Holders in connection with such matters; it being understood and
agreed that Parent shall be entitled to rely in all respects upon the
decisions and actions of the Equity Holders' Representative with respect
thereto. The Equity Holders' Representative shall be authorized to take any
and all actions which it believes are necessary or appropriate under this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document, including executing the Escrow
Agreement as Equity Holders' Representative, giving and receiving any notice
or instruction permitted or required under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement by the Equity Holders' Representative, interpreting all of the terms

full power and authority to interpret on behalf of the Equity Holders all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document and
to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of the Equity Holders
in its capacity as Equity Holders' Representative.

(z) After the Closing, the Equity Holders' Representative shall have
reasonable access to information concerning any indemnity claim to the extent
that such information is in the possession, custody or control of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
provide reasonable assistance to the Equity Holders' Representative in the
performance of the Equity Holders' Representative's duties, and the exercise
of the Equity Holders' Representatives rights, under this Agreement and any
other Transaction Document, including for the purpose of evaluating any
indemnity claim against the Escrow Fund; provided that the Equity Holders'
Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in connection with
enforcing rights under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
disclose any nonpublic information from or concerning any indemnity claim to
anyone (except to the Equity Holders' Representative's attorneys, accountants
or other advisers, to the Indemnifying Equity Holders and to any other Person
on a need-to-know basis, but only if such other Person agrees to keep such
information confidential).

(aa) In the performance of the Equity Holders' Representative's duties and
exercise of the Equity Holders' Representative's rights under this Agreement
and any other Transaction Document, the Equity Holders' Representative shall
be entitled to rely upon any document or instrument reasonably believed to be

authorized to do so.

(bb) The Equity Holders' Representative is authorized, in the Equity Holders'
Representative's sole discretion, to comply with final, non-appealable orders
or decisions issued or process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction
or arbitrator with respect to the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow
Fund is disbursed to the Equity Holders' Representative and is at any time
attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, the



Equity Holders' Representative is authorized, in its sole discretion, but in
good faith, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it
without the need for appeal or other action; and if the Equity Holders'
Representative complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, the
Equity Holders' Representative's shall not be liable to any Equity Holder or
to any other Person by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ,
judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

(cc) Subject to the terms of the Equity Holders Agreement, the powers of the
Equity Holders' Representative hereunder are irrevocable, and any action taken

the same. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are hereby made, and are
hereby acknowledged to be, dependent on the actions, decisions, instructions
and determinations that are contemplated or permitted to be made by the Equity
Holders' Representative pursuant to this Section 6.9, and the rights of all
Equity Holders shall be qualified by and dependent upon such actions,
decisions, instructions and determinations, irrespective of whether the Equity
Holders' Representative is acting as an agent or power of attorney of such
Equity Holders.



Section 6.10. Officers' and Directors' Indemnification.

(a) In the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a
"DandO Claim"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Person who was immediately prior to the Effective Time a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "DandO Indemnified
Party") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on
the fact that such Indemnified Party was immediately prior to the Effective
Time a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond to such
DandO Claim. From and after the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent
permitted by applicable Law, each DandO Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such DandO Claim, and in the event of any such DandO Claim,
(A) Parent and the Surviving Corporation from and after the Closing Date,
shall promptly pay expenses incurred by each Indemnified Party as the same are
incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such DandO Claim and (B)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such DandO Claim;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
provided further that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation hereunder to any DandO Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non-appealable, that indemnification of such DandO
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any DandO Claim, shall notify Parent
and the Surviving Corporation thereof; provided that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to
indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on
the personal liability of, each DandO Indemnified Party provided for in the
respective charters, bylaws or organizational documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any successor or assign of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such claim.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and Parent agrees not to
cancel for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, a fully paid tail
policy with coverages as described on Schedule 6.10(c) and with a deductible
or self insured retention, as applicable, of no greater than $50,000 per claim
(the "Tail Policy"). The costs of purchasing the Tail Policy as of immediately
prior to the Closing shall be borne by the Company as a Company Expense.
Parent shall be solely and exclusively liable for making all payments of
deductibles or self insured retentions (as the case may be) under the Tail
Policy that first become due and payable following the Anniversary Date up to
a maximum of $50,000 per claim made with respect to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their current or previous officers or directors in
their capacities as such (the "Deductible Payments"). The Indemnifying Equity
Holders shall be solely and exclusively liable and responsible for making all
payments of all amounts, whenever due, under and with respect to the Tail
Policy, except for the Deductible Payments (all such amounts, including the
amount of all deductibles or self insured retentions in excess of the maximum
Deductible Payments and all deductibles and self insured retentions that first
become due and payable on or prior to the Anniversary Date, being



collectively the "Insurance Amounts"), it being understood and agreed that (i)
no Parent Indemnitee shall be liable for the payment of, or responsible for
the consequences of the non-payment of, any Insurance Amounts; (ii) all Parent
Indemnitees shall be indemnified against the non-payment of any Insurance
Amounts and all consequences of such non-payment, including all Indemnifiable
Losses related thereto, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) any
Parent Indemnitee may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without any
obligation whatsoever to do so, pay any Insurance Amounts at any time and from
time to time, whereupon the Parent Indemnitee making such payment shall be
indemnified against, and entitled to prompt reimbursement from the
Indemnifying Equity Holders for, all Insurance Amounts so paid.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) The obligations of Parent and its Affiliates under this Section 6.10 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Person to whom this Section 6.10 applies without the consent of such affected
Person.

Section 6.11. WARN Act. Parent shall be liable and responsible for any
notification required under the WARN Act (or under any similar state or local
applicable Laws), and Parent shall indemnify and hold the Equity Holders and
each of their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective directors,
officers and agents harmless from and against any Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by such Persons as a result of the failure of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of the
WARN Act on or after the Closing Date or Parent's failure to comply with the
provisions of this Section 6.11.

Section 6.12. Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Parties to, at the sole expense of Parent, provide such
reasonable cooperation in connection with any financing by Parent or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the Merger as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

Section 6.13. Acknowledgement by Parent and MergerCo.

(a) Parent and MergerCo conducted to their satisfaction an independent
investigation and verification of the financial condition, results of
operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making their determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and MergerCo have
relied solely on the results of their own independent investigation, the
agreements of the Company and the Indemnifying Equity Holders set forth herein
and the representations and warranties of the Company expressly and
specifically set forth in Article III and Section 9.1, as qualified by the
Schedules.

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent certain projections,
forward-looking statements, forecasts, estimates and business plan information
(collectively, the "Projections"). The Company covenants and agrees that the
Projections were prepared by the Company in good faith. Parent and MergerCo
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the
Projections, that Parent and MergerCo are familiar with such uncertainties,
that Parent and MergerCo are responsible for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of any Projections provided to them in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the reasonableness



of the assumptions underlying such Projections), that except as explicitly set
forth in Article III and Section 9.1, no representations, warranties or
statements of any kind are being made with respect thereto, that none of
Parent, MergerCo nor any of their representatives is relying thereon, and that
Parent, MergerCo and their representatives shall have no claim against anyone
with respect thereto, except in the case of fraud or of a breach of a
representation or warranty that is explicitly set forth in Article III or
Section 9.1.

Section 6.14. Books and Records. In order to facilitate the resolution of any
claims made against or incurred by the Indemnifying Equity Holders in
connection with this Agreement, for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3(g), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) retain the Books and Records relating
to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the
prior practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) upon reasonable
notice, afford the Equity Holders' Representatives reasonable access
(including the right to make, at the Equity Holders' Representative's expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such Books and Records solely
to the extent reasonably requested by them in connection with any such claim;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to provide the Equity Holders' Representative with access to any
Books and Records pursuant to this Section 6.14 where such access would
violate any Legal Requirement; and provided further, that the obligation to
maintain Books and Records with respect to any specific claim shall terminate
before the end of such six (6) year period if, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, no actions for indemnification may be brought with respect to such
specific claim and no such action is continuing.

Transaction Documents, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

(j) Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have executed and delivered the Escrow
Agreement.

(k) The Company shall have executed and delivered the Employment Agreement.

(l) Parent shall have executed and shall have delivered to the Company and to
the Equity Holders' Representative a written agreement in form and substance
acceptable to them wherein Parent agrees to a Move Out Indemnification Amount
(as contemplated by Item 7 of Schedule 8.2(a)(x)) that is acceptable to the
Company and to the Equity Holders' Representative.

(m) Parent and MergerCo shall have delivered to the Company such other
documents or instruments as the Company has reasonably requested and that are
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Transaction Documents upon the terms set forth in this
Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII -SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

(n) All covenants in this Agreement, including all obligations with respect to
Special Indemnification Matters, shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect indefinitely (except for obligations with respect to those
matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(x), which shall survive until the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, and unless any such covenant by its
explicit terms terminates as of an earlier date). Each of the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, Article IV and Article IX shall
survive the Closing, without further action, until the date that is the
twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Anniversary
Date"), except for Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.10, 3.16, 3.17(b) and 9.1
(collectively, the "Company Fundamental Reps") and Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4
(collectively, the "Parent's Fundamental Reps"), and obligations with respect
to Special Indemnification Matters (other than those matters set forth on
Schedule 8.2(a)(x)), which shall survive the Closing and terminate upon the



expiration of the respective statutes of limitations, including any tolling
thereof, that are applicable to the matters covered thereby, and for
obligations with respect to those matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(x),
which shall survive the Closing and terminate upon the third (3rd) anniversary
of the Closing Date (in each case unless extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)
below). The Company Fundamental Reps and Parent's Fundamental Reps are
collectively referred to as the "Fundamental Reps").

(o) The indemnification obligations contained in this Article VIII and in
Article IX will survive the Closing and shall remain in effect:

(i) until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to any indemnifiable claim related to (A) the breach of the Company
Fundamental Reps or Parent's Fundamental Reps, (B) the breach of any covenant
by the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Indemnifying Equity
Holders, on the one hand, or by Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the
other hand, or (C) any Special Indemnification Matter not set forth on
Schedule 8.2(a)(x);

(ii) until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to
those matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(x); and

(iii) until the Anniversary Date for any indemnifiable claims that are not
specified in Sections 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(b)(ii).

Unless a claim for indemnification with respect to any alleged breach of any
representation or warranty is asserted by notice given as herein provided that
identifies a particular breach and the underlying facts relating thereto,
which notice is given within the applicable period of survival for such
representation or warranty, such claim may not be pursued and is irrevocably
waived after such time. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing sentence, no claim for indemnification with respect to any
representation or warranty will be deemed to have been properly made except
(x) to the extent it is based upon a Third Party Claim or Special
Indemnification Matter or (y) to the extent based on Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by an Indemnitee for which indemnification is provided under Section
8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i) (excluding any such matter that constitutes a
Special Indemnification Matter), and such indemnification claim is made or
brought (including by notice as provided herein) prior to the expiration of
the survival period for such representation or warranty. For purposes of
clarity, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth herein,
claims asserted in writing (including by notice as provided herein) before the
applicable period of survival for a representation or warranty or Special
Indemnification Matter terminates shall be deemed timely made regardless of
whether litigation or arbitration proceedings are commenced by such date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if either party
makes a claim for indemnification in writing by notice given as provided
herein and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement with respect to any
matter for which indemnification is provided under Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.2(b) prior to the applicable expiration date as provided in Section 8.1(b),
the representation, warranty or covenant, as applicable, and the
indemnification obligations contained in this Article VIII and in Article IX
with respect to such claim shall survive indefinitely with respect to all
Indemnifiable Losses arising in connection with such claim, whenever incurred,
until such claim is finally resolved and all amounts required to be paid
hereunder have been fully paid in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 8.2. Indemnification.

(e) Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this Article
VIII, the Common Stockholders, jointly and severally from the Escrow Fund as
contemplated by the final sentence of Section 8.3(d), and to the extent the
Escrow Fund is insufficient or to the extent amounts have not been distributed
from the Escrow Fund as required by this Agreement due to the failure by the
Equity Holders' Representative



to give the joint written instructions required by the final sentence of
Section 8.2(c) (such amounts being "Unavailable"), the Indemnifying Equity
Holders, severally and jointly with any other Indemnifying Equity Holder that
is its Affiliate but severally and not jointly with any other Indemnifying
Equity Holder, hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers and agents (collectively, with Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
the "Parent Indemnitees"), from and against, and to pay such Persons as
incurred, all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out
of:

(i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in Article III, Section 9.1 or in the certificate provided
pursuant to Section 7.1(a) of this Agreement;

(ii) a breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement of the Company
contained in this Agreement, the performance of which has not been explicitly
waived by Parent in writing, provided, however, that this Section 8.2(a)(ii)
shall not be applicable as to the Company for breaches first occurring after
the Closing Date;

(iii) those matters set forth in Section 9.2;

(iv) any violations or alleged violations of, or claims under, ERISA
(including claims by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or under any
other Law governing employee, pension or welfare benefits;

(v) any amount payable with respect to any Dissenting Share, Option or Warrant
in excess of the amount of Merger Consideration allocated to such Dissenting
Share, Option or Warrant pursuant to this Agreement and reasonable out of
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent, MergerCo and the Surviving
Corporation in connection therewith;

(vi) reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent, MergerCo
and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the exercise of appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 2.3;

(vii) any violations or alleged violations of fiduciary care or loyalty to the
Company by any of its directors or officers prior to the Closing;

(viii) all costs and expenses of the Company or any Equity Holder relating to
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby that are not paid and satisfied
at or prior to the Closing to the extent not included in Estimated Working
Capital or Closing Working Capital;

(ix) the allocation of the Merger Consideration among the Equity Holders and
the funding of the Holdback Amount at Closing; and

(x) those matters described on Schedule 8.2(a)(x) (all matters referenced in
Section 8.2(a)(ii) through and including this Section 8.2(a)(x) being
collectively the "Special Indemnification Matters").

(f) Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this Article
VIII, Parent will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equity Holders and
each of their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective directors,
officers and agents from and against, and to pay such Persons as incurred, all
Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of:



(i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations or warranties
made by Parent or MergerCo in Article IV or in the certificate provided
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) of this Agreement; and

(ii) a breach by Parent or MergerCo of any covenant or agreement of Parent or
MergerCo contained in this Agreement, the performance of which has not been
explicitly waived by the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Equity
Holders' Representative in writing.

(g) All payments made on behalf of the Common Stockholders, the Indemnifying
Equity Holders or any of their respective Affiliates (including payments out
of the Escrow Fund) or by Parent or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be,
to or for the benefit of other parties pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes. Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Equity Holders shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment. As between Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative, upon the settlement or resolution of any claim for
indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Corporation while the Escrow Fund
remains held by the Escrow Agent, Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative agree to provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
regarding the disbursement of funds to the applicable party, all in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement.

Section 8.3. Limitations on Liability.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

(ii) "Indemnifying Party" means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement; and

(iii) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any losses, liabilities, damages, costs,
expenses, assessments, fines, interest, penalties, awards, deficiencies and
all other obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees and expenses, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending any matter or claim) actually suffered
or incurred by an Indemnitee, whether (A) directly incurred by an Indemnitee
or (B) incurred in connection with any actual or threatened actions, suits,
demands, assessments, judgments or settlements made on account of actions or
claims by a Person other than such Indemnitee.

(i) As between the Company or any Affiliate of the Company (as of or prior to
the Effective Time), the Common Stockholders and the Indemnifying Equity
Holders, on the one hand, and Parent and any Affiliate of Parent (including
the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time), on the other
hand, the remedies, rights and obligations set forth in this Article VIII will
be the sole and exclusive remedies, rights and obligations with respect to the
liabilities and obligations referred to in Sections 8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(b)(i),
except with respect to any matters involving fraud. Without limiting the
foregoing, as a material inducement to entering into this Agreement, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties waives any
claim or cause of action that it otherwise might assert based upon claims made
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(b)(i), except for claims or
causes of action brought under and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VIII, except with respect to any matters involving fraud. The parties
agree that the Common Stockholders and the Indemnifying Equity Holders shall
not be entitled to contribution from the Company and shall not be allowed to
recover any other amount from the Company or to otherwise cause or require the
Company to satisfy or pay, in whole or in part, any obligation of the Common
Stockholders or the Indemnifying Equity Holders to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates,



including any obligations of the Common Stockholders or the Indemnifying
Equity Holders pursuant to this Article VIII. The provisions in this Article
VIII relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the remedies of
the Indemnitees with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Equity Holders hereunder.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of any applicable
Law, except for Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or relating to any
inaccuracies in or breaches of the Fundamental Reps or with respect to Special
Indemnification Matters or to matters involving fraud (none of which shall be
subject to this Section 8.3(c)), no Indemnitee will be entitled to
indemnification for a claim against an Indemnifying Party under Sections
8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i) until the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by such Indemnitee exceeds $750,000 (all amounts up to and including
such amount, the "Basket Amount"); provided, that (i) in the event the
aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses incurred by such Indemnitee exceeds
the Basket Amount, then the Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for the
amount of Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; (ii) for all
purposes of this Article VIII and Section 9.2, including the determination of
whether the amount of Indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, the
terms "material," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse
Effect," "Knowledge of the Company" or "Company's Knowledge" and other similar
qualifications contained in or otherwise applicable to such representations
and warranties shall be ignored for purposes of determining the amount of any
Indemnifiable Losses; and (iii) it is expressly understood and agreed that
claims and Indemnifiable Losses related to or arising out of fraud, the
Special Indemnification Matters and the Fundamental Reps shall not be subject
to the Basket Amount provisions of this Section 8.3(c).

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither the
indemnification obligations of the Common Stockholders and the Indemnifying
Equity Holders under Section 8.2(a)(i) nor the indemnification obligations of
Parent under Section 8.2(b)(i) shall exceed an amount equal to the Escrow
Amount (the "Cap Limitation"); provided, however, that the Cap Limitation
shall not apply to any inaccuracies in or breaches of the Fundamental Reps or
with respect to Special Indemnification Matters or to matters involving fraud.
Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, the Common Stockholders and the
Indemnifying Equity Holders shall be obligated to provide indemnification for
all Indemnifiable Losses that may be asserted pursuant to Section 8.2(a).
Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, Parent shall be obligated to
provide indemnification for all Indemnifiable Losses that may be asserted
pursuant to Section 8.2(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article VIII, all amounts due from the Common Stockholders and the
Indemnifying Equity Holders pursuant to this Article VIII shall be paid (i)
first out of the Escrow Fund to the extent that funds are then held in the
Escrow Fund and are available to pay such amounts and (ii) if at any time or
from time to time the funds then held in the Escrow Fund are Unavailable or
are insufficient to pay such amounts in excess of the Escrow Fund (including
on account of the Escrow Fund being previously disbursed in whole or in part),
then the Indemnifying Equity Holders shall be obligated to pay, and they shall
promptly pay to Parent such Indemnifying Equity Holder's Pro Rata Portion of
such amounts; provided, however, that except with respect to matters involving
fraud, in no event will the liability of an Indemnifying Equity Holder for the
indemnification required by this Agreement exceed the amount of Merger
Consideration received by such Indemnifying Equity Holder and its Affiliates,
which, for the sake of clarity, includes the portion of the Escrow Amount and
Holdback Amount deposited or held on behalf of each such Indemnifying Equity
Holder and its Affiliates.

(l) Each Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify each
Indemnitee hereunder for all damages that are reasonably foreseeable arising
out of a matter for which such Indemnifying Party has agreed to provide
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that except (i) in connection
with matters involving fraud and (ii) if and to the extent such damages have
been recovered by a third person



(including a Governmental Authority) and are the subject of a Third Party
Claim or a Tax Claim for which indemnification is available under this Article
VIII or Section 9.2, respectively, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or
obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee hereunder for any punitive or exemplary
damages.

(m) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss payable under this Article VIII shall
be calculated net of any insurance proceeds that an Indemnitee receives from
any third party insurer with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss, less any
payments, costs, fees, expenses, premiums (including premium increases but
only to the extent they are incurred on account of such Indemnifiable Losses),
deductibles or retention or other payments, costs or expenses incurred or paid
by the Indemnitee and its Affiliates with respect to or in connection with
such Indemnifiable Loss or the matters giving rise thereto. An Indemnitee
shall seek recovery for Indemnifiable Losses under the Indemnitee's policies
with third party insurers (to the extent the Indemnitee reasonably believes
such policies cover such Indemnifiable Loss) to the same extent as such
Indemnitee would seek recovery under such policies if such Indemnifiable Loss
was not subject to indemnification hereunder. It is understood and agreed that
the provisions of this Section 8.3(f) shall not delay or toll the obligation
of an Indemnifying Party to provide indemnification for and to pay
Indemnifiable Losses as required by this Agreement, provided, however, that in
the event an Indemnitee receives and is entitled to retain a payment from a
third party insurer with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss for which indemnity
payments have already been made hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount
paid by such third party insurer (net of the amounts described above, and not
to exceed the amount of indemnity payments previously made hereunder with
respect to such Indemnifiable Loss) shall promptly be made to the applicable
Indemnifying Party.

(n) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be calculated (i) net of any Tax Benefit actually realized
by the relevant Indemnitee in the Tax year of the Indemnifiable Loss and (ii)
increased by the amount of any Tax Cost incurred by the relevant Indemnitee as
a result of the receipt or accrual of any indemnification payment. "Tax
Benefit" means, with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss subject to any
indemnity under Article VIII, an amount by which the net Tax liability of an
Indemnitee (or a group filing a Tax Return that includes such Indemnitee) is
actually reduced in, or prior to, the year the Indemnifiable Losses were
incurred solely as a result of such Indemnifiable Losses or the amount of Tax
refund that is generated solely as a result of such Indemnifiable Losses, and
any related interest received from the applicable Taxing Authority. "Tax Cost"
means an amount by which the net Tax liability of an Indemnitee (or a group
filing a Tax Return that includes such Indemnitee) is actually increased
solely as a result of (and would not have been increased but for) the receipt
of, or entitlement to, any indemnification payment and any related interest
owed to the applicable Taxing Authority.

(o) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Equity Holders' Representative
shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other
party hereunder.

(p) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any
Indemnifiable Losses arising from a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein (and the amount of any Indemnifiable
Losses incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in the
calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the
extent that the dollar amount of such liability is specifically included in
the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital and/or the Closing Working
Capital.

(q) Any liability for indemnification under this Section 8.3 shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.



(r) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Indemnifiable Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII,
provided that any expenses reasonably incurred in connection with such
commercially reasonable mitigation efforts shall constitute Indemnifiable
Losses subject to indemnification hereunder (subject to the other limitations
on indemnification provided in this Article VIII).

Section 8.4. Defense of Claims.

(d) Any Indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder, whether or not in
connection with a Third Party Claim, shall, in accordance with this Section
8.4, give to the Indemnifying Party written notice (each, a "Claim Notice")
with respect to Indemnitee's claim for indemnification (each, a "Claim")
setting forth (i) the facts giving rise to such Claim, (ii) if then known, the
amount (or the method of computation of the amount) of such Claim and (iii) a
reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document
or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such
Claim is based.

(e) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any action or proceeding by any third party, including any
Governmental Authority (a "Third Party Claim"), against such Indemnitee, with
respect to which an Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party a
reasonably prompt Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim, but in
any event not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after Indemnitee's receipt
of notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of
the Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall only relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to
this Article VIII to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure (whether as a result of the forfeiture of
substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). Within fifteen (15) calendar
days following receipt of notification of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, upon written notice to the Indemnitee,
to elect to assume and control the investigation and defense thereof;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume,
control or continue the investigation and defense thereof only if, and only
for so long as (i) the Third Party Claim does not consist of, in whole or in
part, or relate to or arise in connection with, a criminal proceeding,
criminal action, indictment, criminal allegation or criminal investigation by
a Governmental Authority; (ii) an Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee are
not both named parties to the Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitee has not
reasonably concluded based on the advice of counsel that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be or could reasonably be expected to
become inappropriate under applicable ethical standards due to actual or
potential conflicting interests, (iii) the Indemnifying Party is validly bound
by a written agreement executed by the Indemnifying Party in favor of the
Indemnitee to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to the full amount of such
Third Party Claim, regardless of the applicable limitations set forth herein,
(iv) the Indemnifying Party is able to demonstrate (and upon the request of
the Indemnitee made from time to time the Indemnifying Party does promptly
demonstrate) to the reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnitee that the
Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources to pay both the
reasonable projected costs of the defense of such Third Party Claim and the
entire amount of such Third Party Claim (assuming, for these purposes, that
the Third Party Claim is lost by the Indemnifying Party), (v) any settlement
of or an adverse judgment with respect to the Third Party Claim could not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnitee or
its continuing business interests and (vi) the Indemnifying Party conducts the
defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently. If the Indemnifying
Party has validly assumed the investigation and defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall nevertheless have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel unless one of the following is applicable (in which event the
Indemnifying Party will pay all fees and expenses of such separate counsel):
(A) the employment of such separate counsel has been specifically authorized
in writing



by the Indemnifying Party, (B) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay
those fees and disbursements, (C) the named parties to the proceeding in which
such Third Party Claim has been asserted include both the Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnitee and, in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnitee, there
exists one or more defenses that are in conflict with those available to the
Indemnifying Party or (D) the Indemnifying Party fails to undertake or is not
entitled to undertake or continue the defense of such matter pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 8.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and disbursements of more
than one counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with any one proceeding or
any similar or related proceedings arising from the same general allegations
or circumstances. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any
Third Party Claim for which it has undertaken the defense; provided, however,
that without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would
result in (1) the imposition of a consent order, injunction, decree,
restriction, agreement or judgment that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of, or impose any non‑monetary liability, obligation or commitment on,
the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (2) a finding or admission of any
criminal liability on the part of an Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or a
finding or admission of a violation of Law by the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates, (3) a finding or admission that would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened or reasonably
anticipated to be made against the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or (4)
any monetary liability of the Indemnitee that shall not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Any such settlement or compromise must
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant of a
release of the Indemnitee from all liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim. If a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant (which offer provides for a full and
unconditional release of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates), and the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnifying
Party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay the full amount
called for by such offer without reservation of any rights or defenses against
the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may continue to contest such Third Party Claim,
free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the
lesser of (y) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined
to accept plus the Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitee relating to such
Third Party Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or
(z) the aggregate Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitee with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

(f) Any Claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does
not result from a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party a reasonably prompt Claim Notice with respect to such
Claim, provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to notify the
Indemnifying Party of such Claim shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party
from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure (whether as a result of the forfeiture of substantive rights or
defenses or otherwise). The Indemnifying Party will have a period of forty-
five (45) calendar days within which to respond in writing to such Claim
Notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such forty-five
(45) calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted such Claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Article VIII.

(g) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall be entitled
under this Agreement with respect to any Claim shall be determined by (i) the
written agreement between the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party (provided
that if payments with respect to such claim are to be made from the Escrow
Fund or the Holdback Amount, or if any Indemnitee or any Indemnifying Party is
an Indemnifying Equity Holder, such determination shall be made and such
written agreement shall be executed by the Equity Holders' Representative on
behalf of the Equity Holders, such Indemnitee or such Indemnifying Party, as
the case



may be) or (ii) any order, decree or judgment of a court or arbitrator of
competent jurisdiction who decides the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnitee is entitled hereunder, and such order, decree or judgment is deemed
to be final and non-appealable. The order, decree or judgment of a court or
arbitrator shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired, and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined.

ARTICLE IX - TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1. Representations and Obligations Regarding Taxes. As of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Closing, except as set forth on Schedule 9.1
hereto, the Company hereby makes to Parent and MergerCo each and every one of
the representations and warranties contained in this Section 9.1 with the
understanding that Parent and MergerCo are relying upon the truth, accuracy
and completeness of such representations and warranties in determining to
consummate the Merger upon the terms set forth in this Agreement:

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all federal income and
all other Tax Returns that they have been required to file (or to have filed).
All such Tax Returns were true, correct and complete and were prepared in
compliance with all applicable Laws and Legal Requirements. All Taxes owed by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return and
whether or not any Tax Return was required) have been paid and all other Taxes
otherwise due from the Company and its Subsidiaries have been paid or properly
accrued in accordance with GAAP in the Base Balance Sheet. None of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. Since January 1, 2010, no claim has
been made by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where none of the Company
nor its Subsidiaries files Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) The Base Balance Sheet reflects adequate accruals and reserves in
accordance with GAAP for all Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all taxable periods (and portions thereof) through the date of the Base
Balance Sheet.

(c) All material deficiencies for Taxes asserted or assessed in writing
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully and timely
paid, settled or properly accrued in accordance with GAAP in the Base Balance
Sheet.

(d) No federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax audits or administrative or
judicial Tax proceedings are pending, or being conducted or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, are threatened with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
from any federal, state, local or non-U.S. Taxing Authority (including
jurisdictions where neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have filed
Tax Returns) any (i) written notice indicating an intent to open an audit or
other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters or (iii)
notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed,
asserted or assessed by any Taxing Authority against the Company or its

Closing Date as a result of (i) any change in method of accounting for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Code § 481(c) (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) any "closing agreement" as

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has had a permanent
establishment in any foreign country, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged, or has ever engaged, in a trade or business in any
foreign country. No Taxing Authority is asserting or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatening to assert a claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under or as a result of Code § 482 or any similar provision of
any state or local or non-U.S. Tax law.

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a foreign person within
the meaning of Code § 1445.



(n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock or

as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b)(5) or Treas. Reg. § 1.6011‑4T(b)(5).

(s) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, at any time, acquired
assets from another Person in a transaction in which the Company's Tax basis
for the acquired assets was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to
the Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of
the transferor.

(t) All amounts required by Legal Requirements or by contract to be withheld
or reported by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to amounts paid
or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, equity owner, member or third
party, whether with respect to wages, salaries or other payments, including
the payment of social security taxes and other Tax obligations, have been duly
and timely withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority (and,
if not so paid over, have been properly accrued in accordance with GAAP in the
Base Balance Sheet and will be included as a liability in the calculation of
the Closing Working Capital).

(u) There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets or properties of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

(v) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of
the date of the Base Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (as
distinguished from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect

Base Balance Sheet (as distinguished from any notes thereto) and (B) do not
exceed the reserve for Tax liability as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Effective Time in accordance with the past practices, policies and
procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.
Since the date of the Base Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary
gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.



(w) The Independent Contractors, and all other Persons who have previously
rendered services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and who were
classified as independent contractors by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Previous Contractors"), have been, during all previous
periods as to which all applicable statutes of limitations with respect to
such matters have not run and expired, and are legally, properly and
appropriately classified and treated as non-employees for all Tax purposes and
under all Laws, including for all ERISA, Tax withholding, payroll tax,
unemployment insurance and employee benefit purposes including for purposes of
determining whether such Persons are exempt or non-exempt. There has been no
determination by any Governmental Authority that any Independent Contractor or
Previous Contractor constitutes or constituted an employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and to the Company's Knowledge, there is no basis for
a Governmental Authority or any other Person to make such a claim. During all
periods as to which all applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
following matters have not run and expired, there has been no investigation,
inquiry, complaint, charge, audit or claim brought or made by or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened by any Person or Governmental Authority based
upon or including allegations that Persons who do or have performed services
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have not been legally, properly or
appropriately classified and treated as non-employees for all Tax purposes
under all Laws and/or for all other purposes, including as to whether any
Independent Contractor or Previous Contractor constitutes or constituted, or
should be reclassified as, an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any purpose.

Section 9.2. Indemnification for Taxes. From and after the Closing, the Common
Stockholders, jointly and severally from the Escrow Fund as contemplated by
the final sentence of Section 8.3(d), and to the extent the Escrow Fund is
insufficient, the Indemnifying Equity Holders, severally and jointly with any
other Indemnifying Equity Holder that is its Affiliate but severally and not
jointly with any other Indemnifying Equity Holder shall, pursuant to the terms
of Article VIII, indemnify Parent, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and
agents (each herein sometimes referred to as an "Indemnified Taxpayer")
against, and protect, save and hold harmless each Indemnified Taxpayer from,
any and all damages, deficiencies, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys', accountants' and experts' fees and disbursements resulting from:

(i) except to the extent such Taxes were included in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, any Taxes of the Company allocable to any period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or, as provided in Section 9.3(c)
hereof, allocable to any period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date;

(ii) any Tax of any Person other than the Company for periods ending on or
before the Closing Date imposed upon the Company as a result of the Company
being included prior to the Closing Date in a combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax group under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
the applicable Law of any Governmental Authority) or, as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise, except for a contract the principal
purpose of which is not to indemnify or pay the Taxes of another Person; or

(iii) any gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or
other similar Tax imposed on the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and one-half of any transfer Tax so imposed; or

(iv) any misrepresentation regarding Taxes or any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set forth in this Article IX.



In addition to and not in lieu of the other provisions set forth in this
Agreement, no Person other than an Indemnified Taxpayer shall be entitled to
settle any claim relating to Taxes if the settlement of the claim would be
likely, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Taxpayer, to cause the
liability for any Tax of the Indemnified Taxpayer for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date to materially increase (including by making any
election or taking any action having the effect of making any election, by
deferring the inclusion of any amount in income or by accelerating the
deduction of any amount or the claiming of any credit).

Section 9.3. Additional Agreements.

(x) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to Section 6.3(b), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, (i)
grant to the Equity Holders' Representative and its representatives access at
all reasonable times to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records
(including tax workpapers and returns and correspondence with tax
authorities), including the right to take extracts therefrom and make copies
thereof, to the extent that such books and records relate to the operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries during taxable periods ending on or prior to
or that include the Closing Date, and (ii) otherwise cooperate with the Equity
Holders' Representative in connection with any audit of Taxes that relate to
the Company Business prior to the Closing.

(y) Surviving Corporation will prepare, or cause to be prepared, in accordance
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns and all related
forms for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (or Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date
and end after the Closing Date) that are filed after the Closing Date. The
Surviving Corporation will provide the Equity Holders' Representative with
copies of any such Tax Returns for the Equity Holders' Representative's
reasonable review and comment, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto). If the Equity Holders'
Representative agrees with the Tax Returns, then the Surviving Corporation
shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns. If, within ten (10) days
after the receipt of the Tax Returns, the Equity Holders' Representative
notifies the Surviving Corporation that it disputes the manner of preparation
of the Tax Returns (it being understood and agreed that any such dispute must
be made in good faith on a reasonable basis), then the Surviving Corporation
and the Equity Holders' Representative shall attempt to resolve their
disagreement within five (5) days following the notification of such
disagreement. If the Surviving Corporation and the Equity Holders'
Representative are not able to resolve their disagreement, then the dispute
shall be submitted to the Accounting Referee. The parties shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to
resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) days after the date on which they
are engaged or as soon as possible thereafter. The determination of the
Accounting Referee shall be binding on the parties. The cost of the services
of the Accounting Referee will be borne by the party whose calculation of the
matter in disagreement differs the most from the calculation as finally
determined by the Accounting Referee. Further, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to be remitted to the
applicable Taxing Authorities no later than the due date of such Tax Returns
(subject to any extensions).

(z) In the case of any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating solely to Taxes of the Company for any period prior to the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation (in consultation with the Equity Holders'
Representative) shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to
represent the interests of the Company, and to employ counsel of the Surviving
Corporation's choice at the Surviving Corporation's expense to carry out that
representation.



(aa) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before the Closing Date all
Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax indemnity, or similar Tax agreements or
arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Person (other than the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are parties to, and neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates shall have any obligations thereunder after the
Closing.

(bb) If the Surviving Corporation receives any Tax refund or credit (including
refunds and credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Closing Date or otherwise) for Taxes paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Period") or the Pre-Closing Period portion of any Straddle Period,
Parent shall pay over to the Equity Holders' Representative for distribution
to the Common Stockholders the amount of such refund or credit (including any
interest that is paid in connection with the applicable refund), but only to
the extent such refund or credit specifically and explicitly is for the Pre-
Closing Period or the Pre-Closing Period portion of any Straddle Period, and
except to the extent such Tax refund or credit is included as an asset in the
determination of Closing Working Capital. Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative shall equitably apportion any refund or credit with respect to
Taxes with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or
for any period beginning before the Closing Date and ending on or after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") and, in order to effect such apportionment,
to the extent not already included in the balance sheet upon which Closing
Working Capital is determined, the amount of all such refunds and credits
shall be included as assets in the determination of Closing Working Capital.

(cc) In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period, (i) property Taxes of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall
be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes
(other than property Taxes) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended on and included the Closing Date; provided, that exemptions,
allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of the Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. All such Taxes allocable
to the Pre-Closing Period shall be included as current liabilities in the
balance sheet upon which Closing Working Capital is determined.

(dd) Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative will cooperate, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing and preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article IX and any
proceeding related thereto. Such cooperation will include the retention and
(upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent will retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date
until 30 days after the expiration of the statute or period of limitations of
the respective Tax periods. Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative
further agree, upon the other party's request, to provide the other party with
all information that any party may be required to report pursuant to Code §§
6043 and 6043A.

(ee) Without the prior written consent of the Equity Holders' Representative,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall:



(i) amend or permit the amendment of any Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period or for any Straddle Period; (ii) extend
or permit the extension of any statute of limitations with respect to such Tax
Returns; (iii) make any election under Treas. Reg. §1502-32(b)(4) (or any
comparable state or local Tax election); or (iv) make an election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable state or local Tax provision) with
respect to the Merger.

ARTICLE X -TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 10.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after Equity Holder approval hereof:

(s) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; or

(t) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other party:

(i) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
an injunction or taken or threatened any other action that does or would
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or modify the terms of, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that threatens to or
does seek or award damages or any equitable remedy against Parent, the
Company, MergerCo or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger
(collectively, a "Governmental Action") which Governmental Action has not been
resolved or lifted despite the commercially reasonable efforts of the parties
to this Agreement, which efforts such parties hereby agree to undertake (it
being understood and agreed that the requirement to undertake commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve or lift a Governmental Action shall not include
a requirement that Parent, the Company, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates (A) sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses; (B) terminate existing relationships, contractual rights
or obligations; (C) terminate any venture or other arrangement; (D) create any
relationship, contractual right or obligation; (E) effectuate any other change
or restructuring; (F) commence any litigation; or (G) take any extraordinary
action (and, in each case, entering into agreements or stipulating to the
entry of an order or decree or consenting to an action)); or

(ii) if the consummation of the Merger shall not have occurred on or before
April 5, 2015 (the "End Date"), provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before
the End Date; or

(u) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing), or if any
representations or warranties of the Company shall have become untrue, which
breach or failure to perform or untrue representation or warranty (A) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after Parent giving
written notice to the Company of such breach (a "Company Material Breach")
(provided, in each case, that Parent is not then in Parent Material Breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this
Agreement); or

(v) by the Company, if Parent or MergerCo shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement (including the



obligation to consummate the Closing) or if any representations or warranties
of Parent or MergerCo shall have become untrue, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.2 and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the
Company giving written notice to Parent of such breach (a "Parent Material
Breach") (provided that the Company is not then in Company Material Breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this
Agreement).

Section 10.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Parent,
MergerCo or the Company or their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members or stockholders and all rights and obligations of
any party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements contained in Section
6.3, this Section 10.2 and Article XI; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 10.2 shall relieve any party from liabilities or
damages arising out of any breach by such party of any of its pre-Closing
covenants contained in this Agreement or for fraud.

Section 10.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at
any time before or after any approval hereof by the Equity Holders; provided,
however, that after any such approval by the Equity Holders, no amendment
shall be made that by law requires further approval by the Equity Holders
without obtaining the approval of the Equity Holders of the Company.

Section 10.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such extension or
waiver is to be enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by
a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver
of the same term or condition by such party or a waiver of any other term or
condition of this Agreement by such party.

Section 11.2. Schedules. The section number headings in the schedules to this
Agreement (the "Schedules") correspond to the Section numbers in this
Agreement. The mere listing of an agreement on a Schedule is not sufficient
disclosure of any breach thereunder without further disclosure of the nature

on one Schedule shall constitute an exception to any other representations or
warranties made in this Agreement only if (i) the substance of such exception
is reasonably disclosed on each applicable Schedule or (ii) a specific cross-
reference to a disclosure on another Schedule, which also reasonably discloses
the substance of the exception, is made. Matters reflected in the Schedules
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be

informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Capitalized terms used in the Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

Section 11.3. Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement shall be

Section 11.4. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 11.5. No Agreement Until Executed. The exchange of drafts of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents does not impose upon any Person an
obligation to continue, in good faith or at all, negotiations with respect to
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, it being understood and agreed
that any Person may discontinue such negotiations at any time in their sole
discretion for any reason or for no reason. Irrespective of negotiations among
the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, neither this Agreement nor any Transaction Document shall
constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or

unless and until this Agreement or such Transaction Document is executed by

Section 11.8. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, each of Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall bear its own expenses in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 11.9. Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction. All disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, or the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would require the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Each of the parties hereby consents to personal jurisdiction, service of
process and venue in the federal or state courts of the State of Delaware for
any claim, suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, or in the case of a Third Party Claim subject to
indemnification hereunder, in the court where such claim is brought.

Section 11.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of proper
jurisdiction, including the obligation to close the Merger on the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof. Such remedies shall not be exclusive and shall
be in addition to any other remedies that any party may have under Article
VIII of this Agreement.

Section 11.11. Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have
been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby
who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, and
therefore waive their effects.

Section 11.12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
(together with all schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto) constitute the
sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with
respect to such subject matter.

Section 11.13. Counterparts; Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

Section 11.14. Acknowledgement. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or
in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Equity Holders'
Representative shall have the right, at its election, to retain Barrett and
McNagny LLP ("Sellers' Counsel") to represent it and/or the Equity Holders in
such matter, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby irrevocably waive
and consent to any such representation in any such matter and the
communication by Sellers' Counsel to the Equity Holders' Representative or any
Equity Holder in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
Sellers'



Counsel arising by reason of Sellers' Counsel's prior representation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably
acknowledge and agree that all communications between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers' Counsel, on the other hand,
made in connection with the Merger, including the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery of, and the Closing under, or any dispute or proceeding
arising under or in connection with, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby that, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to
be privileged communications of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Sellers' Counsel, on the other hand, and would not be subject to
disclosure to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with any
process relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall continue after the
Closing and for all purposes be deemed to be privileged communications between
the Equity Holders' Representative and the Equity Holders, on the one hand,
and Sellers' Counsel, on the other hand, and neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the
grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and not to the Equity Holders' Representative and
the Equity Holders.

This ESCROW AGREEMENT, dated as of ________, 2015 (this "Escrow Agreement"),
is by and among Forward Air, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Parent"), ZM
Private Equity Fund I, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as the Equity

A. CLP Towne Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), Parent, FAC Subsidiary,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MergerCo"), the Equity Holders' Representative
and the parties set forth on the signature pages thereto as the Indemnifying
Equity Holders have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
February 4, 2015 (the "Underlying Agreement"), pursuant to which MergerCo is
merging with and into Company, and Company shall be the surviving corporation
in the merger (the "Merger"). The Underlying Agreement provides that Parent

Escrow Agent to settle certain contingencies, if any, as provided in Sections
2.8 and 9.2 and Article VIII of the Underlying Agreement.

B. Escrow Agent desires to accept its appointment as escrow agent and to hold
and disburse the funds deposited with it and the earnings thereon in
accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

C. In order to establish the escrow of funds for the purpose of securing the
indemnification obligations and certain other obligations in favor of Parent
under the Underlying Agreement, the parties hereto have entered into this
Escrow Agreement.

STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for
themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows:

1.Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Escrow Agreement
shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Underlying Agreement. The
following terms shall have the following meanings when used herein:

accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow Agreement, to act as the
Equity Holders' Representative's authorized representatives under this Escrow
Agreement.

"Authorized Parent Representatives" shall mean the persons so designated on
Schedule A hereto or any other person designated in a writing signed by Parent
and delivered to Escrow Agent 

and the Equity Holders' Representative in accordance with the notice
provisions of this Escrow Agreement, to act as Parent's authorized

to and the alleged basis for such Claim, (iii) the Claim Amount, (iv) the
sequential number of such Claim in relation to all Claim Notices previously
delivered hereunder, (v) the date of such Claim Notice, and (vi) the aggregate
Claim Amounts of all Claims as to which Claim Notices have been delivered.

Holders' Representative, which shall set forth whether or not the Equity
Holders' Representative disputes any matter with respect to a Claim Notice or
the Claim described therein.

"Escrow Funds" shall mean the amount specified on Schedule A hereto deposited

together with any interest and other income thereon.

"Escrow Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending
on the applicable date set forth on Schedule A hereto.

"Joint Written Direction" shall mean written instructions executed by Parent
and the Equity Holders' Representative directing Escrow Agent to disburse all
or a portion of the Escrow Funds or to take or refrain from taking an action
pursuant to this Escrow Agreement.

2.Appointment of and Acceptance by Escrow Agent. Parent and the Equity
Holders' Representative hereby appoint Escrow Agent to serve as the escrow
agent hereunder. Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and, upon
receipt by wire transfer of the Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 3
below, agrees to hold, invest and disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with
this Escrow Agreement.

3.Deposit of Escrow Funds. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Escrow Agreement, Parent will transfer the Escrow Funds in the amount set
forth on Schedule A hereto and pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Underlying
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account of
Escrow Agent referenced on Schedule A hereto. Promptly upon receipt, such
funds shall be promptly invested and shall thereafter be held by Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms set forth herein.

4.Disbursements of Escrow Funds. 

(a)Scheduled Disbursement Dates. Subject to Section 4(b) and Section 5 below,
Escrow Agent shall disburse some or all of the Escrow Funds upon receipt of a
Joint Written Direction in accordance with the scheduled disbursement dates
set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. Such Joint Written Direction shall
contain wiring instructions for each recipient of Escrow Funds or addresses to
which checks shall be sent to such recipients. It is understood and agreed
that (i) all disbursements to be made to the Common Stockholders who have
validly tendered their Certificates in accordance with the Underlying
Agreement shall be distributed first to the Equity Holders' Representative,
and the Equity Holders' Representative will further disburse such amounts,
including all interest and other income earned thereon, to the Common
Stockholders who have validly tendered their Certificates in accordance with
the Underlying Agreement, and (ii) any disbursements to be made to Common
Stockholders who have not validly tendered their Certificates in accordance
with the Underlying Agreement shall instead be distributed to Parent who will
hold such funds, including all interest and other income earned thereon, with
any other Merger Consideration to be paid to such Common Stockholders in
accordance with the Underlying Agreement until such time as those Common
Stockholders have validly tendered their Certificates in accordance with the
Underlying Agreement.

(b)Court Order. Escrow Agent shall disburse some or all of the Escrow Funds
within five (5) days after receipt by Escrow Agent of, and as directed in, any
order, decree or judgment of a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction
presented by either the Equity Holders' Representative or Parent and certified
to be final and non-appealable, and directing Escrow Agent to distribute some
or all Escrow Funds (a "Certified Non-Appealable Order").

(c)Expiration of Escrow Period. The Escrow Period will expire upon the
distribution of Escrow Funds on the final scheduled disbursement date set
forth on Schedule A attached hereto; provided, however, that Escrow Agent
shall retain an amount of the Escrow Funds sufficient to pay the portion of
Claim Amounts with respect to unresolved Claims, if any, that have not been
paid at such time. If Escrow Agent has retained any Escrow Funds with respect
to such Claim Amounts, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, either
(i) retain all such remaining Escrow Funds, to be held and invested in
accordance with the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, until receipt by
Escrow Agent of a Joint Written Direction with respect to the disposition of
such amounts, or receipt by Escrow Agent of a Certified Non-Appealable Order
presented by the prevailing party and certified to be final and non-appealable
directing Escrow Agent to distribute some or all of the Escrow Funds, or (ii)
resign as escrow agent in the manner described in Section 8 below.

(d)Withheld Amounts. All disbursements of Escrow Funds shall be subject to
Escrow Agent's right to withhold amounts equal to the claims and fees of
Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 10 and Section 11 below.

5.Indemnity Claims. Parent shall deliver each Claim Notice to the Equity
Holders' Representative and Escrow Agent, such delivery to be in accordance
with the notice provisions of this Escrow Agreement. Upon receipt of any Claim
Notice, Escrow Agent shall promptly make entries or notations in the account
records relating to the Escrow Funds indicating that funds in the amount of
the Claim Amount are reserved to satisfy the Claim specified in such Claim
Notice and identifying the date and number of such Claim Notice. Within ten
(10) business days of receipt by the Equity Holders' Representative of any
Claim Notice, the Equity Holders' Representative shall 

deliver a Claim Response to Parent and Escrow Agent with respect to such Claim
Notice, such delivery to be in accordance with the notice provisions of this
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding any failure of the Equity Holders'
Representative to submit a timely Claim Response or a Claim Response that does
not dispute the Claim in such Claim Notice, Escrow Agent shall disburse Escrow
Funds pursuant to such Claim Notice only upon the receipt of a Joint Written
Direction or a Certified Non-Appealable Order. Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility to determine whether any Claim Notice or Claim Response has
been received by the Equity Holders' Representative or Parent, as applicable,
or to provide any Claim Notice or Claim Response to either the Equity Holders'
Representative or Parent, as applicable.

6.Suspension of Performance. If, at any time, (a) there shall exist any
unresolved dispute between the Equity Holders' Representative and Parent with
respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of the Escrow Funds or
any other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder, or (b) Escrow Agent is unable
to determine, to Escrow Agent's sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of
any portion of the Escrow Funds or Escrow Agent's proper actions with respect
to its obligations hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion,
take either or both of the following actions:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

refrain from taking any action under this Escrow Agreement until such dispute
or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of Escrow Agent or
until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed (as the case may be),
provided, however, that Escrow Agent shall continue to safely hold the Escrow
Funds until it is directed otherwise by a Joint Written Direction or a
Certified Non-Appealable Order; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

resign in accordance with Section 8. 

Subject to Section 9 hereof, Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the
Equity Holders' Representative, the Common Stockholders (as defined in the
Underlying Agreement), Parent, Parent's shareholders or any other person with
respect to any failure or refusal to take any action hereunder pursuant to
this Section 6 (including, without limitation, the failure or refusal to
disburse some or all of the Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 4 hereof), other
than to safely hold and invest the Escrow Funds. 

7.Investment of Funds. Escrow Agent is hereby directed and instructed to
initially invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in the investment indicated on
Schedule A hereto. With the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the parties
hereto acknowledge receipt of prospectuses and/or disclosure materials
associated with the investment vehicle, either through means of hardcopy or
via access to the website associated with the investment selected by the
parties to this Escrow Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that they
have discussed the investment and are in agreement as to the selected
investment. Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative may provide
instructions changing the investment of the Escrow Funds (subject to
applicable minimum investment requirements) by the furnishing of a Joint
Written Direction to Escrow Agent; provided, however, that no investment or
reinvestment may be made except in the following:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the
principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the
United States of America; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

certificates of deposit issued by any bank (including Escrow Agent and its
affiliates), bank and trust company, or national banking association, but only
to the extent such certificates of deposit are fully insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"); or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

any institutional money market fund offered by Escrow Agent, including any
institutional money market fund managed by Escrow Agent or any of its
affiliates. 

If Escrow Agent has not received a Joint Written Direction at any time that an
investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds,
or such portion thereof as to which no Joint Written Direction has been
received, in investments described in clauses (i) or (iii) above. Escrow Agent
agrees that, except to the extent the Escrow Funds are invested in a non-
interest bearing transaction account, Escrow Agent shall hold all property
constituting the Escrow Funds as a custodian and bailee, such property shall
not be property of Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent shall segregate such
property from all property of Escrow Agent and shall mark its books and
records and otherwise identify the Escrow Funds as being held in connection
with this Escrow Agreement. No investment shall be made in any instrument or
security that has a maturity of greater than four (4) months. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may, without notice to
Parent or the Equity Holders' Representative, sell or liquidate any of the
foregoing investments at any time if the proceeds thereof are required for any
disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted or required hereunder, provided,
however, that Escrow Agent shall promptly invest such funds in a non-interest
bearing transaction account pending disbursement or promptly reinvest such
funds in the manner permitted by this Escrow Agreement. All investment
earnings shall become part of the Escrow Funds and investment losses shall be
charged against the Escrow Funds. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that any and all interest or other income accrued or earned on the
Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be part of the Escrow Funds. Subject to Section
9 hereof, Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in the
value of any investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, or for any
loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of the Escrow
Funds. With respect to any Escrow Funds received by Escrow Agent after ten
o'clock, a.m., Richmond, Virginia time, Escrow Agent shall not be required to
invest such funds or to effect any investment instruction until the next day
upon which banks in Richmond, 

Virginia are open for business; provided, however, that such funds shall be
deposited in a non-interest bearing transaction account pending investment.

8.Resignation of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from
the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative
specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect. Parent and the
Equity Holders' Representative jointly shall appoint a successor escrow agent
hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation and shall cause such
successor escrow agent to execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining
to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the successor escrow
agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems
advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all
fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys' fees) due and owing to
the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and
the exercise of its rights hereunder. If Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the
expiration of thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice of resignation,
Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and
any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties
hereto. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice
period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Funds (without any obligation to
reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow
agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of delivery
Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the
provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 hereunder. After any retiring escrow
agent's resignation, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement. Any corporation or association into
which Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially
all of the escrow business of Escrow Agent's corporate trust line of business
may be transferred, shall be Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without
further act.

9.Liability of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such
duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties or obligations shall be
implied. Escrow Agent shall have no liability under, and no duty to inquire as
to, the provisions of any agreement other than this Escrow Agreement. Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of
any liability or loss to the Equity Holders' Representative or Parent. Escrow
Agent's sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of
the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow
Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged
with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set
forth herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or
other instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and
effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information
contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the person or parties purporting to
sign the same. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages (including, but not
limited to, lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Escrow
Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or commence any 

proceeding in connection with the Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow
Funds are deposited, this Escrow Agreement or the Underlying Agreement, or to
appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding. Escrow
Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or
question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any
other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute
involving any party hereto, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully
indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the
reasonable opinion or instruction of such counsel. The Equity Holders'
Representative, on behalf of the Common Stockholders, and Parent, jointly and
severally, shall promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses
of any such counsel. As between Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative,
the amounts, if any, required to be paid to Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Section 9 shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Equity Holders'
Representative, on behalf of the Common Stockholders. Escrow Agent shall have
no liability or responsibility to question or determine the accuracy or
reasonableness of any Claim Amount.

Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders
issued or process entered by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction
with respect to the Escrow Funds. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any
time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, writ,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such
property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, Escrow Agent is
authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected
by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action. If
Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall
not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by
reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may
be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

10.Indemnification of Escrow Agent. From and at all times after the date of
this Escrow Agreement, the Equity Holders' Representative and Parent, jointly
and severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee,
attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Escrow Agent
Indemnified Parties") against any and all actions, claims (whether or not
valid), losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs
and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of Escrow Agent Indemnified
Parties from and after the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or
consequential, as a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any
claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or
investigation) by any person, including, without limitation, the Equity
Holders' Representative or Parent, whether threatened or initiated, asserting
a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any person under any statute
or regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or state securities
laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or
failure of performance of this Escrow Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not any Escrow Agent Indemnified Party is a
party to any such action, proceeding, suit or is the target of any such
inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that no Escrow Agent Indemnified
Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent Indemnified Party.
Escrow Agent shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to 

select and employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought
or asserted against an Escrow Agent Indemnified Party, and the reasonable fees
of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by the Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent, jointly and severally; provided, however, that the
Equity Holders' Representative and Parent shall not, in connection with any
proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
reasonable fees of counsel of more than one separate firm (plus, if required,
one separate firm admitted to practice in a local jurisdiction) at any one
time retained by an Escrow Agent Indemnified Party unless the employment of
more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent. The obligations of the Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent under this Section 10 shall survive any termination
of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. As
between Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative, the amounts, if any,
required to be paid to Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 10 shall be paid
50% by Parent and 50% by the Equity Holders' Representative, on behalf of the
Common Stockholders.

The parties agree that neither the payment by the Equity Holders'
Representative or Parent of any claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification
hereunder, nor the disbursement of any amounts to Escrow Agent from the Escrow
Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification, shall impair,
limit, modify or affect the respective rights and obligations of the Equity
Holders' Representative or the Common Stockholders, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, under the Underlying Agreement.

11.Fees and Expenses of Escrow Agent. The Equity Holders' Representative and
Parent shall jointly compensate Escrow Agent for its services hereunder in
accordance with Schedule A hereto and, in addition, shall reimburse Escrow
Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys'
fees, travel expenses, telephone and facsimile transmission costs, postage
(including express mail and overnight delivery charges), copying charges and
the like. The additional provisions and information set forth on Schedule A
attached hereto are hereby incorporated by this reference and form a part of
this Escrow Agreement. The obligations of the Equity Holders' Representative
and Parent under this Section 11 shall survive any termination of this Escrow
Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent is
authorized to, and may, disburse to itself from the Escrow Funds, from time to
time, the amount of any compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses due and payable hereunder. Escrow Agent shall notify Parent and the
Equity Holders' Representative of any disbursement from the Escrow Funds to
itself in respect of any compensation or reimbursement hereunder and shall
furnish to Parent and the Equity Holders' Representative copies of all related
invoices and other statements within fifteen (15) business days thereafter.
If, for any reason, the Escrow Funds are insufficient to cover such
compensation and reimbursement, the Equity Holders' Representative and Parent
shall promptly pay such amounts to Escrow Agent upon receipt of an itemized

14.USA Patriot Act. Each of the Equity Holders' Representative and Parent
represent (as to itself only) that: (a) it is not a person with whom Escrow
Agent is restricted from doing business with under regulations of the Office
of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") of the Department of the Treasury of the
United States of America (including, those persons named on OFAC's Specially
Designated and Blocked Persons list) or under any statute, executive order
(including, the September 24, 2001 Executive Order Blocking Property and
Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or
Support Terrorism), or other governmental action; and (b) it is not and shall
not engage in any dealings or transactions or otherwise be associated with
such persons. In addition, each of the Equity Holders' Representative and
Parent hereby agree to provide Escrow Agent with any additional information
that Escrow Agent deems necessary from time to time in order to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws concerning money laundering and similar
activities. The following notification is provided to the Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of
2001, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318 ("Patriot Act"):

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the
government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record
information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account,
including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other
extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for
depositors: When a depositor opens an account, if such depositor is an
individual, a lender (including Escrow Agent) will ask for such depositor's
name, taxpayer identification number, residential address, date of birth, and
other information that will allow the lender to identify such depositor, and,
if such depositor is not an individual, Escrow Agent will ask for such
depositor's name, taxpayer identification number, business address, and other
information that will allow the lender to identify such depositor. Escrow
Agent may also ask, if such depositor is an individual, to see depositor's
driver's license or other identifying documents, and, if such depositor is not
an individual, to see such depositor's legal organizational documents or other
identifying documents.

In the event the Equity Holders' Representative or Parent violates any of the
provisions of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, such event shall
constitute a default hereunder and shall entitle Escrow Agent to exercise all
of its rights and remedies at law or in equity against such violating party,
including but not limited to terminating this Agreement.

15.Escheat. The parties are aware that under applicable state law, property
which is presumed abandoned may under certain circumstances escheat to the
applicable state. Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the parties, their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, or any other
party, should any or all of the Escrow Funds and any proceeds thereof escheat
by operation of law. 

16.Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. In the event that any party hereto
commences a lawsuit or other proceeding relating to or arising from this
Escrow Agreement, the parties hereto agree that the federal courts of the
State of Delaware shall have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction. If such
court lacks federal subject matter jurisdiction, the parties agree that the
state courts of the State of Delaware shall have sole and exclusive
jurisdiction. Any of these courts shall be proper venue for any such lawsuit
or judicial proceeding, and the parties hereto waive any objection to such
venue. The parties hereto consent to and agree to submit to the jurisdiction
of any of the courts specified herein and agree to accept service of process
to vest personal jurisdiction over them in any of these courts.

17.Notices. All notices, approvals, consents, requests, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
given when the writing is delivered if given or delivered by hand, overnight
delivery service, facsimile transmitter (with confirmed receipt) or e-mail of
portable document format (PDF) to the address, facsimile number, or e-mail
address set forth on Schedule A hereto, or to such other address as each party
may designate for itself by like notice, and shall be deemed to have been
given on the date deposited in the mail, if mailed, by first-class, registered
or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed as set forth on Schedule A
hereto, or to such other address as each party may designate for itself by
like notice.

18.Amendment or Waiver. This Escrow Agreement may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated only by a writing signed by Parent, the Equity
Holders' Representative and Escrow Agent. No delay or omission by any party in
exercising any right with respect hereto shall operate as a waiver. A waiver
on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to, or waiver of, any
right or remedy on any future occasion.

19.Severability. To the extent any provision of this Escrow Agreement is
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Escrow Agreement.

20.Governing Law. This Escrow Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

21.Entire Agreement. This Escrow Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties relating to the holding, investment and disbursement of
the Escrow Funds and sets forth in their entirety the obligations and duties
of Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Funds.

22.Binding Effect. All of the terms of this Escrow Agreement, as amended from
time to time, shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the Equity Holders'
Representative, Parent and Escrow Agent.

23.Execution in Counterparts. This Escrow Agreement and any Joint Written
Direction may be executed in two or more counterparts, which when so executed
shall constitute one and the same agreement or direction. Facsimile signatures
or signatures e-mailed in portable document format (PDF) shall be acceptable
and binding on the parties hereto as if they were originals. 

24.Termination. Upon the first to occur of (a) the expiration of the Escrow
Period (provided there is no outstanding Claim Notice on such date) and the
disbursement of all Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 4, or (b) Joint Written
Directions or a Certified Non-Appealable Order and the disbursement of any
remaining Escrow Funds pursuant thereto, this Escrow Agreement shall
terminate, Escrow Agent shall be released from its obligations hereunder and
Escrow Agent shall have no further liability with respect to the Escrow Funds,
this Escrow Agreement, or any action or refusal to take action hereunder, to
the Equity Holders' Representative, the Common Stockholders, Parent, Parent's
shareholders or any other person.

25.Dealings. Except as provided by applicable state or federal law, Escrow
Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of Escrow Agent may
buy, sell, and deal in any of the securities of Parent and become pecuniarily
interested in any transaction in which the Equity Holders' Representative or
Parent may be interested, and contract and lend money to the Equity Holders'
Representative or Parent and otherwise act as fully and freely as though it
were not Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement. Nothing herein shall
preclude Escrow Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Equity
Holders' Representative or Parent or for any other entity.

26.Force Majeure. No party to this Escrow Agreement shall be liable to any
other party for losses arising out of, or the inability to perform its
obligations under the terms of, this Escrow Agreement, due to acts of God,
which shall include, but shall not be limited to, fire, floods, strikes,
mechanical failure, war, riot, nuclear accident, earthquake, terrorist attack,
computer piracy, cyber-terrorism or other similar acts beyond the control of
the parties hereto.

27.Taxes. For purposes of federal income taxes and other taxes based on
income, Parent will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Funds until the
distribution of the Escrow Funds (or such portion thereof). Parent represents
that its Taxpayer Identification Number assigned by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other taxing authority listed on Schedule A is true and
correct, and that Parent will notify Escrow Agent in writing immediately upon
any change to such number. Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, Parent
shall provide Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-9. All interest or other
income earned under this Escrow Agreement shall be allocated and paid to the
applicable payees as directed in writing by Parent and the Equity Holders'
Representative and reported as required. Taxes may be withheld by Escrow Agent
as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at the
time of the distribution. In the absence of timely direction, all proceeds of
the Escrow Funds shall be retained as Escrow Funds and reinvested from time to
time by Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7. The Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent each grant to Escrow Agent a right of set-off which
may be exercised to pay any and all taxes, whether federal, state or local,
incurred by the investment of the Escrow Funds. The Equity Holders'
Representative and Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless Escrow Agent against and in respect to liability for taxes and/or any
penalties or interest attributable to the investment of Escrow Funds by Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. As between Parent and the Equity
Holders' Representative, the amounts, if any, required to be paid to Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Section 27 shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the
Equity Holders' Representative, on behalf of the Common Stockholders.

28.Security Call-Back. In the event fund transfer instructions are given
(other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement),
whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, Escrow Agent is authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call- 

back to the person or persons designated in Schedule A hereto, and Escrow
Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or
persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be
changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent.

Backup Federal Income Tax Withholding and Substitute Form W-9. Under the
"backup withholding" provisions of U.S. federal tax law, Parent may be
required to withhold 28% of the payments in respect of surrendered
Certificates. To prevent backup withholding, each surrendering holder should
complete and sign the substitute Form W-9 above, and either: (a) provide the
holder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided is correct (or that such holder is
awaiting a TIN), that the holder is a U.S. person (or a U.S. resident alien)
and that (i) the holder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") that the holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of
failure to report all interest or dividends, or (ii) the IRS has notified the
holder that the holder is no longer subject to backup withholding; or (b)
provide an adequate basis for exemption. If "Applied For" is written in Part I
of the substitute Form W-9, Parent will retain 28% of any payment during the
60-day period following the date of the substitute Form W-9. If the holder
furnishes Parent with his, her or its TIN within 60 days of the date of the
substitute Form W-9, Parent will remit such amount retained during the 60-day
period to the holder, and no further amounts will be retained or withheld from
any payment made to the holder thereafter. If, however, the holder has not
provided Parent with his or her TIN within such 60-day period, Parent will
remit such previously retained amounts to the IRS as backup withholding and
shall withhold 28% of any payment for the surrendered Certificates made to the
holder thereafter unless the holder furnishes a TIN to Parent prior to any
such subsequent payment. In general, a U.S. individual's TIN is the
individual's Social Security Number. If Parent is not provided with the
correct TIN or an adequate basis for exemption, the holder may be subject to a
$50 penalty imposed by the IRS and backup withholding at a rate of 28%. 

Failure to complete the substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause the
Certificates to be deemed invalidly delivered, but may require Parent to
withhold 28% of the amount of any payments for such Certificates. Backup
withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal
income tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will be reduced
by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of
taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided the appropriate returns are filed
with the IRS.

Federal and State Income Tax Withholding. Parent may withhold, on behalf of
the Company, federal and state income tax required to be withheld under
applicable law from the amounts payable under the Merger Agreement.

aside or vacated.

Section 2.2 Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its duties and exercise
of its rights under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and any other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Equity Holders'
Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any
party to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any
other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Equity Holders'
Representative may assume that any person purporting to give any notice in

Escrow Agreement or any other agreement entered into or document delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been
duly authorized to do so. The Equity Holders' Representative will at all times
be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Required Holders;
provided, however, that the Equity Holders' Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as Equity Holders' Representative based upon
any such direction.

Section 2.3 Indemnification. The Equity Holders' Representative shall be
indemnified by the Securityholders for, and shall be held harmless by the
Securityholders against, any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Equity
Holders' Representative or any of its Affiliates and any of their respective
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, members,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or
controlling persons, in each case relating to the Equity Holders'
Representative's conduct as Equity Holders' Representative, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Equity
Holders' Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses resulting
from the Equity Holders' Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its performance under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. This indemnification shall survive the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The costs of such indemnification (including the costs and
expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification) shall be paid (i) first,
from the Holdback Amount, (ii), then, once such funds are exhausted, from the
Escrow Fund out of amounts otherwise payable to the Securityholders to the
extent funds remain in the Escrow Fund after all payments to Parent have been
paid in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
(iii) thereafter, by the Securityholders in accordance with their respective
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion (as defined below). The Equity Holders'
Representative may, in all questions arising under the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and/or any other agreement entered into or
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted
or suffered in good faith by the Equity Holders' Representative in accordance
with such advice of counsel, the Equity Holders' Representative shall not be
liable to any Securityholder. "Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion" means, with
respect to each Securityholder, the percentage derived by dividing (i) the
Common Stock Total Merger Consideration received by each such Securityholder
by (ii) the Common Stock Total Merger Consideration received by all
Securityholders in the aggregate.

Section 2.4 Reimbursement of Expenses. The Securityholders hereby authorize
the Equity Holders' Representative to withhold the Holdback Amount in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. If the funds in the
Holdback Amount are exhausted, the Equity Holders' Representative shall be
entitled to withdraw cash amounts payable to the Securityholders from the
Escrow Fund in reimbursement for out of pocket fees and expenses (including
legal, accounting and other advisors' fees and expenses, if applicable)
incurred by the Equity Holders' Representative in performing its duties under
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and/or any other
agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In the event amounts held
in the Escrow Fund are to be distributed to the Securityholders and at the
time of such distribution the Equity Holders' Representative reasonably
believes that it will incur future out of pocket fees and expenses in
connection with its duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement 

entered into or document delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Equity Holders' Representative shall
be entitled to reserve an amount out of the funds to be delivered to the
Securityholders that it believes is reasonably necessary to cover such future
fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equity Holders'
Representative shall not be limited to the Holdback Amount or the amounts
distributed to the Securityholders from the Escrow Fund to satisfy the
indemnification or reimbursement obligations set forth in this Article II,
and, at the Equity Holders' Representative's election, the Equity Holders'
Representative may seek cash from the Securityholders in satisfaction of any
such indemnification or reimbursement obligations based on their respective
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion; it being understood and agreed that the
Equity Holders' Representative (for itself, and for its partners, members,
officers, managers, directors, employees, agents and representatives) shall be
entitled to full reimbursement for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts, advisors,
consultants, agents and other representatives) incurred by the Equity Holders'
Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers, directors, partners,
members, managers, employees, counsel, experts, advisors, consultants, agents
or other representatives in connection therewith), and to full indemnification
against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as Equity Holders' Representative (except
for those arising out of the Equity Holders' Representative's gross negligence
or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation,
defense, settlement or adjudication of claims. The relationship created herein
is not to be construed as a joint venture or any form of partnership between
or among the Equity Holders' Representative or any Securityholder for any
purpose of U.S. federal or state Law, including federal or state Tax purposes.
Neither the Equity Holders' Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any
fiduciary or other duty to any Securityholder.

Section 2.5 Return of Remaining Funds in Holdback Amount. If, upon the payment
of all amounts owed to the Equity Holders' Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, there remain funds in the account holding the Holdback Amount, the
Equity Holders' Representative shall disburse such remaining funds and any
interest earned thereon to the Common Stockholders in accordance with their
Common Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion.

recitals and mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
Forward Air and the Restricted Party hereby agree as follows: 

1.Acknowledgments Regarding Covenants. These protective covenants are
specifically designed to restrict the Restricted Party's ability to engage in
certain specific business activities that would or might (a) cause competitive
injury to Forward Air's or any of its Subsidiaries' goodwill, customer
relationships, employee relationships or businesses, (b) compromise the
Protected Information of Forward Air or any of its Subsidiaries or (c) damage
the business reputation of Forward Air or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Restricted Party further acknowledges that the legitimate business interests
of Forward Air justify the following restrictive covenants, and that each of
the following restraints is reasonably necessary to protect Forward Air's
legitimate business interests. The Restricted Party further agrees that the
protective covenants are neither overbroad, nor too long, nor otherwise
inappropriate, particularly in light of the benefits to the Restricted Party
arising out of the Merger Agreement. The Restricted Party acknowledges that
the Restricted Party has had an opportunity to review these covenants with the
Restricted Party's counsel, that they were the result of negotiation between
the parties, and that the Restricted Party desires to be bound by the
covenants, as described in this Agreement, in order to obtain the benefits of
the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Restricted Party acknowledges, and it
is agreed, that the law applicable to protective covenants associated with
ownership of equity interests and the disposition of equity interests shall
govern in construing the protective and restrictive covenants made in this
Agreement and in the enforcement of the protective and restrictive covenants
made in this Agreement.

2. Covenants Related to Protected Information. The Restricted Party covenants and agrees to keep all Protected Information confidential for the benefit of Forward Air and its Subsidiaries, and as part of that obligation, shall not at any time, either directly, indirectly or through any Person, disclose, divulge, reveal, report, publish, transfer or use any Protected Information without the prior, express, written consent of Chief Executive Officer of Forward Air (the "CEO") or as permitted pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Restricted Party further covenants and agrees not to record, copy, adapt or distribute any Protected Information without the prior, express, written consent of the CEO or as permitted by the Merger Agreement.

The Restricted Party acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 are reasonable, valid, and necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of Forward Air and each of its Subsidiaries. The parties agree that the Applicable Period with respect to the covenants in this Section 3 shall be extended by any length of time during which the Restricted Party is in breach of the covenants in this Section 3.

4. Covenant Not to Solicit or Provide Services or Products to Customers. The Restricted Party agrees that during the Applicable Period, the Restricted Party will not solicit, provide services to or for, contract with, lend assistance to or for, consult with or for the benefit of, either directly, indirectly or through any Person, any customers or prospective customers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor will the Restricted Party solicit any customers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cease doing Business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor will the Restricted Party solicit any customers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to commence doing Business with any other Person where the Company any of its Subsidiaries had the capability to do the work at the time of the solicitation, nor will the Restricted Party enter into any business arrangement which has the effect of diminishing the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' Business with any customers, nor will the Restricted Party solicit Business from any prospective customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a type or kind that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries performs on a regular basis. The term "solicit" not only is defined as acts or statements of solicitation by the Restricted Party, but also any act or statement whereby the Restricted Party aids or influences others to 

engage in statements or acts amounting to solicitation. It is the parties'
intent that this provision is to be construed as broadly as possible to
protect and preserve the relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with their customers within the geographic and temporal scope of this Section
4. The parties agree that the Applicable Period with respect to the covenants
in this Section 4 shall be extended by any length of time during which the
Restricted Party is in breach of the covenants in this Section 4.

5. Covenant Not to Solicit Employees. The Restricted Party agrees that during the Applicable Period, the Restricted Party will not hire, retain, contract with, or employ or solicit, encourage, or attempt to persuade any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any employee of Forward Air that is engaged in the Business during the Applicable Period (collectively, an "Employee") to terminate such Employee's employment with the Company, Forward Air or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, nor will the Restricted Party solicit or attempt to persuade any Employee to accept employment or work for or with any other Person or business, or engage in self-employment, instead of continuing to work for the Company, Forward Air or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, nor will the Restricted Party engage in any oral or written communication with the any of the Employees at all relating to the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company, Forward Air or their Subsidiaries, as applicable. It is the parties' intent that the covenants in this Section 5 are to be construed as broadly as possible to protect and preserve the employee relationships of the Company, Forward Air and their Subsidiaries within the geographic and temporal scope of this Section 5. For purposes of the foregoing, an "Employee" will include any person who was an employee of the Company, Forward Air or their Subsidiaries at the time of such solicitation. The parties agree that the Applicable Period with respect to the covenants in this Section 5 shall be extended by any length of time during which the Restricted Party is in breach of the covenants in this Section 5.

6. Covenant Not to Disparage. The Restricted Party agrees that the Restricted Party during the Applicable Period will not at any time do or say anything that portrays Forward Air, any of its Subsidiaries, and of their Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, stockholders, investors, management, employees or business in a negative light. It is the parties' intent that this covenant is to be construed as broadly as possible to protect the business reputation of Forward Air and each of its Subsidiaries.

7. Remedies. Forward Air shall be entitled to enforce its rights under this Agreement specifically to recover damages and costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by any breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Restricted Party and to exercise all other rights existing in its favor. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the Restricted Party's breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall materially and irreparably harm Forward Air, that money damages shall accordingly not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the Restricted Party and that Forward Air in its sole discretion and in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity shall be entitled to specific performance and/or other injunctive relief from any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Agreement.
