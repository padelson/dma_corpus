WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

TRANSFER OF UNITS

  

  

1.1 Equity Transfer. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, for the consideration specified in Section 1.2, the Buyer agrees to
acquire from each of the Members, and each Member agrees to transfer, assign
and deliver to the Buyer, the Acquired Units owned by such Member, free and
clear of all Encumbrances (the "Equity Transfer").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

  

 

  

1.2 Consideration.

  

  

(a) In exchange for the acquisition by the Buyer of the Acquired Units and the
covenants of the Members hereunder each Member shall receive, in exchange for
each Company Unit held by such Member immediately prior to the Closing the Per
Company Unit Consideration, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.3(e).

  

  

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to the Buyer a closing statement setting forth the
Company's good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the
"Estimated Adjustment Amount") together with reasonably detailed back-up data
to support such estimate of each item from which such amount is calculated.
The Estimated Adjustment Amount shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and,
to the extent consistent with GAAP, in accordance with the practices and
procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case in accordance
with the form, methodology and principles used in preparing the Balance Sheet.
During the preparation and calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to afford the Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, (A) (i) the Buyer shall issue to each Member, in exchange
for each issued and outstanding Company Unit then held by such Member, the Per
Company Unit Consideration, (ii) the Buyer shall admit each Member as a member
of the Buyer holding the applicable number of Buyer Units, which shall be
evidenced as provided in Article III of the Buyer LLC Agreement, and (iii)
Parent shall issue to each Member a stock certificate (if applicable)
evidencing the applicable number of Class B Parent Shares in accordance with
the Third Amended and Restated Parent Certificate and the Buyer LLC Agreement
and (B) in consideration for the Parent Contribution Amount the Buyer shall
issue to Parent a number of Buyer Units, or a number of Buyer Units held by
Parent shall be cancelled, as applicable, such that the number of Buyer Units
held by Parent equals the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding
immediately after the Closing.

  

  

1.3 Transfer Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Members' Representative a Closing statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth the Buyer's good faith calculation of the Adjustment Amount,
including, without limitation, Net Debt, together with reasonably detailed
back-up data to support each item from which such amount is calculated. The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent
not inconsistent therewith, using the same methodologies used in preparing the
Balance Sheet, taking into account information that becomes available after
the Closing in accordance with GAAP. The Company shall cooperate with the
Buyer in the preparation of the Closing Statement as reasonably requested by
the Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) The Members' Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days
following the Buyer's delivery of the Closing Statement to notify the Buyer of
the Members' Representative's election to dispute the Closing Statement or any
portion thereof. During such thirty (30)-day period, the Buyer and Parent
shall provide the Members' Representative and its agents and representatives
with reasonable access to all books, records and employees of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer and Parent (including supporting documents and
working papers) to the extent relating to the preparation or review of the
Closing Statement. If (i) at any time during such thirty (30)-day review
period, the Members' Representative delivers written notice to the Buyer of
its acceptance of the Closing Statement or (ii) prior to the expiration of
such thirty (30)-day review period, the Members' Representative does not
deliver to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement specifying the nature
and amount of any disputed item (a "Notice of Disagreement"), then the Closing
Statement and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be deemed
final and binding on the Members and the Members' Representative. To the
extent that the Members' Representative delivers a timely Notice of
Disagreement, the Members, Buyer and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed
with all items and amounts in the Closing Statement not specifically
referenced in such Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall
not be subject to review in accordance with this Section 1.3(b) or Section
1.3(d). Any Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements (i) based
upon either mathematical errors or amounts reflected in the Closing Statement
or (ii) that either the Closing Statement or the calculation of the Adjustment
Amount, or any amount contained therein was not prepared in accordance with
this Article I (together with any corresponding definitions).

  

  

(c) During the thirty (30)-day period following timely delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Members' Representative to the Buyer, the Buyer and the
Members' Representative shall in good faith seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters identified therein,
and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed by
Buyer and the Members' Representative) be considered compromise negotiations
under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar
state rule. During such thirty (30)-day period, the Members' Representative
shall provide the Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Members'
Representative, to the working papers of the Members' Representative and its
Representatives relating to such Notice of Disagreement. Any disputed items
resolved in writing between the Members' Representative and the Buyer within
such thirty (30)-day period shall be final and binding with respect to such
items, and if the Members' Representative and the Buyer agree in writing on
the resolution of all disputed items specified by the Members' Representative
in the Notice of Disagreement, the Adjustment Amount as so determined shall be
final and binding on the Parties.

  

  

(d) In the event that the Members' Representative and the Buyer are unable to
resolve all disputed items in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30)
days following the date upon which the Buyer received written notice from the
Seller Parties disputing the Closing Statement, then within ten (10) days
after the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, the Buyer and the
Members' Representative shall submit, in writing, to the Accounting Firm,
their briefs detailing their views as to the nature and amount of each item
remaining in dispute, and the Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item, which determination shall be
final and binding for purposes of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall be
(i) engaged by the Buyer and the Members' Representative on a joint basis and
(ii) authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between the
parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.3 within the range
of the difference between the Buyer's position with respect thereto and the
Members' Representative's position with respect thereto. The determination of
the Accounting Firm shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Accounting
Firm that it reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 1.3. The Buyer and the Members' Representative shall request that
the Accounting Firm render its determination prior to the expiration of sixty
(60) days after the dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm, and such
determination and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be final
and binding on all of the Parties and the Members' Representative. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Company.

(e) Following the final determination of the Adjustment Amount, (i)(A) if the
Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the
Schedule of Members (as defined in the Buyer LLC Agreement) shall be adjusted
to reflect the cancellation of the number of Buyer Units held by the Members,
and (B) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is greater than the Adjustment
Amount, the Schedule of Members (as defined in the Buyer LLC Agreement) shall
be adjusted to reflect the issuance of the number of Buyer Units to the
Members, in each case equal to the product of (x) such excess, divided by (y)
$10, and (ii) in accordance with Article IV of the Third Amended and Restated
Parent Certificate and the Buyer LLC Agreement, Parent shall reacquire and
cancel Class B Parent Shares held by the Members or issue additional Class B
Parent Shares to the Members, as applicable (and Parent shall cancel and/or
issue certificates representing such Class B Parent Shares as needed to
evidence such issuances or cancellations of such Class B Parent Shares), such
that the number of Class B Parent Shares held by a Member at all times equals
the number of Buyer Units held by such Member. Any cancellation or issuance
pursuant to the foregoing shall be pro rata among the Members in proportion to
the number of issued and outstanding Company Units held by such Member
immediately prior to the Closing as compared to the total number of Company
Units held by all Members immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

1.4 Withholding of Tax. The Buyer (or any other payor) shall be entitled (but
not obligated) to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to the Members pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer shall
determine in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Members.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE COMPANY

  

  

As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions, except as set forth on the correspondingly
numbered section or subsection of the Company Schedules (it being agreed that
the disclosure of any item in one section or subsection thereof shall be
deemed included on any other section or subsection and to modify each other
representation or warranty (even if such representation or warranty does not
reference the Company Schedules) to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on its face), the Company represents and warrants to the
Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

  

  

3.1 Organization and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) The Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and is
qualified or registered to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
registration necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified,
registered or in good standing is not reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole). Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and
is qualified or registered to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
registration necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified,
registered or in good standing is not reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the full corporate or
limited liability company (as applicable) power and authority necessary to own
and operate its properties and to conduct its business as now conducted.
Complete and accurate copies of the organizational documents of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries (as in effect prior to amendment in connection
with the Reorganization) have been delivered to the Buyer prior to the date
hereof and reflect all amendments made thereto at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement. A complete and accurate copy of the limited liability
company agreement of the Company is attached as Exhibit O to the Restructuring
Agreement and, as of the Closing, the limited liability company agreement of
each of Subsidiaries of the Company is substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit P to the Restructuring Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or in violation of any provision of its
operating agreement or other organizational document or any resolution adopted
by its members or managers.

  

  

(b) Schedule 3.1 lists each Subsidiary of the Company and sets forth all
jurisdictions in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified or
registered to do business. The books of account and transfer ledgers of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are accurate, up-to-date and complete,
and have been maintained in accordance with prudent business practices and all
applicable Laws. Following the completion of the 351 Exposure Statement, the
Seller Parties shall cause to be delivered to Buyer a statement of the tax
basis of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is complete and
accurate in all material respects. There have been no meetings or other
Proceedings or actions, resolutions or consents of the members of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the managers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are not fully reflected in such minutes. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has conducted any business under or otherwise
used, for any purpose, any fictitious name, assumed name, trade name or other
name, other than the names set forth on Schedule 3.1.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.2 Authority for Agreement. The Company has full limited liability company
power, authority and legal right to enter into and perform its obligations
under the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party and to
consummate the Transactions. The managers and the members of the Company have
unanimously authorized the Company's execution, delivery and performance of
the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Transactions and the
Company has provided the Buyer with a true, correct and complete copy of each
such authorization. No other limited liability company proceedings on the part
of the Company, or any member of the Company, are, or will be, necessary to
approve and authorize the Company's execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents or consummation of the Transactions. The Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party have been or will be duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming due execution and delivery by all
counterparties thereto, are or will be legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights in general or the rules governing availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and general
principals of equity, regardless of whether considered in a Proceeding in
equity or at law (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions").

  

  

3.3 No Violation to Result. Other than with respect to the Securities Laws or
as may be required by reason of Parent's or the Buyer's participation in the
Transactions, and assuming all consents or filings set forth on Schedule 3.3
are obtained or made, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of the Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions and the fulfillment by the
Company of the terms hereof and thereof, do not and will not, directly or
indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both): (a) violate,
breach, conflict with, constitute a default under, accelerate or permit the
acceleration of the performance required by (i) any of the terms of the
operating agreement or other organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any resolution adopted by the managers or members of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Material Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or their assets
are bound, or (iii) any Law or other legal requirement of any Governmental
Authority applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (b) give any
Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy or accelerate
performance or maturity under any Material Contract or cancel, terminate or
modify any Material Contract; (c) give any Governmental Authority the right to
revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate or modify, any material permit or
license that is held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that
otherwise is used in or necessary for the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' business or any of the assets owned or used by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any
material Encumbrance or restriction (other than as expressly provided in the
Transaction Documents) in favor of any Person (other than the Buyer) upon any
of the Acquired Units or any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Contract entered into by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of (a)(ii), (a)(iii) and (b), where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
is not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). No
notice to, filing with, or consent of any Governmental Authority under any Law
or any Person under any Material Contract is necessary in connection with, and
no "change of control" provision in any Material Contract is, or will be,
triggered by, the authorization, approval, execution, delivery or performance
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Transaction Documents or the
consummation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Transactions
pursuant thereto, except (x) as set forth on Schedule 3.3, (y) under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act or other federal or state securities, "blue
sky" or takeover Laws and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the "Securities Laws") or (z) any notice, filing or consent,
the failure of which to be made or obtained, as applicable, is not material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.4 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof (without giving effect to the Reorganization), the
ownership of the issued and outstanding membership interests of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are set forth on Schedule 3.4(a). Immediately
following consummation of the Reorganization, the Members are the sole record
and beneficial owners of all of the issued and outstanding membership
interests of the Company.

  

  

(b) All of the issued and outstanding membership interests or other equity
securities of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been duly
authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except
as set forth on Schedule 3.4(b), following the consummation of the
Reorganization, all of the outstanding membership interests or other equity
securities of each Subsidiary of the Company will be owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of any Encumbrances other than
applicable Securities Laws. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4(b), no
restrictions on transfer, repurchase option, right of redemption, preemptive
rights, proxies, membership agreements, rights of first refusal or other
similar agreements or rights exist with respect to the membership interests or
other equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no such
rights will arise by virtue of the Transactions, in each case, other than as
set forth in the applicable operating agreement or other organizational
documents of such entity, the Restructuring Agreement and the other agreements
to be delivered in connection therewith and in the Transaction Documents.

  

  

(c) There is no: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call, warrant or right
(whether or not currently exercisable) to acquire or sell or issue any
membership interests or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or
may become convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any membership
interests or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iii) Contract under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to acquire, sell or otherwise issue
any of its membership interests or other equity securities; in each case,
other than as set forth in the applicable operating agreement or other
organizational documents of such entity or the Restructuring Agreement and
other agreements to be delivered in connection therewith. There are no
outstanding restricted securities, phantom securities or other equity-based
compensation arrangements, profit participation or other similar rights with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) All membership interests or other equity securities of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have been issued in compliance with all applicable
Securities Laws and other applicable legal requirements. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to redeem or otherwise acquire any of
its outstanding membership interests or other equity securities other than as
set forth in the applicable operating agreement or other organizational
documents of such entity.

  

  

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4(e), (i) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has with respect to any Person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries any direct or indirect debt, equity or other investment or
interest in any Person or (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any commitments to contribute to the capital of, or make loans to or share
losses of, any Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (either
pursuant to a written Contract or a Contract in the process of being
negotiated).

  

  

3.5 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) Schedule 3.5(a) includes true, complete and correct copies of the Year-End
Financials. The Year-End Financial Statements (i) were prepared consistent
with the Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records, (ii) present
fairly in all material respects the combining financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
combining results of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' operations and cash

GAAP.

  

  

(b) Following the completion of the Required Financial Statements, the Seller
Parties shall, pursuant to Section 6.24, deliver to Parent and the Buyer as a
supplement to Schedule 3.5(a) true, complete and correct copies of the
Required Financial Statements. Each of the Required Financial Statements
(including in all cases the notes thereto, if any) (i) was prepared consistent
with the Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records, (ii) presents

Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the results of the

required by GAAP to be included in interim financial statements and will not
include year-end adjustments) and (iv) to the extent required for inclusion in
the Public Disclosure Documents, when filed, mailed or distributed, as

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a), since the Balance Sheet Date,
there has been no material change in the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
accounting policies, except for any such change required because of a
concurrent change in GAAP. The Company has delivered to the Buyer copies of
each management letter or other letter delivered to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by its accounting firm in connection with the Financial
Statements or relating to any review by such accounting firm of the internal

8  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) Any financial statements (and the notes thereto, if any) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall,
when delivered, (i) be prepared consistent with the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' books and records, (ii) present fairly in all material respects

respect to the Year-End Financial Statements, on a combining basis), (iii) be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (provided that any unaudited financial
statements included in the Required Financial Statements will not include

of the SEC.

  

  

(e) Schedule 3.5(e) provides a breakdown and aging of all accounts receivable,
notes receivable and other receivables of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of May 31, 2014 that is accurate in all material respects. All existing
accounts receivable (net of any allowances for doubtful accounts) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including those accounts receivable reflected on
the Balance Sheet that have not yet been collected and those accounts
receivable that have arisen since the Balance Sheet Date and have not yet been
collected) represent valid obligations to the Company and its Subsidiaries
arising from bona fide transactions entered into in the ordinary course of
business. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(e), no Person has any
Encumbrance, other than a Permitted Encumbrance, on such receivables or any
part thereof, and no agreement for deduction, free goods, discount or other
deferred price or quantity adjustment shall have been made with respect to any
such receivables.

  

  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain, or will
establish prior to the Company Schedule Update Date and through the Closing
Date, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act. The Company's and its Subsidiaries' disclosure controls and
procedures are, or as of Company Schedule Update Date and through the Closing
Date will be, reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's or its Subsidiares' management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Based on its then-most recent evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting prior to the date thereof, management of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will have disclosed to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
auditors prior to the Company Schedule Update Date (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Company's and its Subsidiaries' ability to
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting, and
each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has
been disclosed to the Buyer, in each case as discovered or determined to exist
pursuant to such evaluation.

3.6 Liabilities. There are no Liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(excluding, for the sake of clarity, the Excluded Entities), other than: (a)
Liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet and not previously paid or
discharged; (b) Liabilities that would not be required to be reflected on a
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the sake of
clarity, the Excluded Entities) prepared in accordance with GAAP; (c)
Liabilities incurred after the Balance Sheet Date arising in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice; (d) Liabilities under,
or expressly permitted or required to be incurred in accordance with, the
Transaction Documents or the Transactions; (e) performance obligations under
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; (f) performance obligations
under Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business (none of which
results from, arises out of, relates to or was caused by any breach of
contract or breach of warranty); or (g) Expenses. As of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a guarantor of Indebtedness
of any other Person other than endorsements for collection in the ordinary
course of business. Schedule 3.6 provides an accurate and complete breakdown
as of May 31, 2014 of all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, (a) any Contract associated with off-balance
sheet financing, including any arrangement for the sale of receivables, (b)
any hedging, derivatives or similar Contract or arrangement, (c) any sale-
leaseback arrangement or synthetic lease, or (d) any Contract pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make any capital
contribution or other investment in or loan to any Person.

  

  

3.7 Adverse Changes. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, since the Balance
Sheet Date, (a) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has operated its
business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice; (b) the
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) have not suffered a Material
Adverse Effect or any effect, event or change that individually or in the
aggregate is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole); and (c) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, omitted any action or
entered into any agreement or understanding that, if taken, omitted or entered
into following the date hereof, would constitute a breach of Section 6.2
hereof.

  

  

3.8 Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Schedule 3.8(a) sets forth a true, correct, and complete list of each
Benefit Plan, other than immaterial fringe benefits. None of any current or
former employee, director, consultant or independent contractor of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries would receive benefits under any arrangement that
would meet the definition of "Benefit Plan" where any of the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' Affiliates' maintain, sponsor or contribute to such
arrangement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) There has been delivered to the Buyer, with respect to each Benefit Plan,
the following: (i) a copy of the annual report (if required under ERISA) with
respect to each such Benefit Plan for the most recent plan year (including all
schedules and attachments); (ii) a copy of the summary plan description,
together with each summary of material modification required under ERISA with
respect to such Benefit Plan; (iii) a true and complete copy of each written
Benefit Plan document and all amendments thereto that have been adopted since
the most recent plan restatement; (iv) all trust agreements, insurance
contracts and other funding instruments with respect to each funded or insured
Benefit Plan; and (v) copies of all nondiscrimination and top-heavy testing
reports for the most recent plan year with respect to each Benefit Plan that
is subject to nondiscrimination and/or top-heavy testing.

  

  

(c) Each Benefit Plan and each related trust has been maintained and
administered in accordance in all material respects with its governing
instruments and in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including,
but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. All payments and contributions by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries required by any Benefit Plan, by any
collective bargaining agreement or by applicable Law (including all employee
and employer contributions, insurance premiums, or intercompany charges) have
been timely made when due in amounts not in excess of the limits imposed by
the terms of such Benefit Plan or applicable Law for the relevant period to
which such payments or contributions relate, except, in each case, as would
not result in any material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All unpaid amounts attributable to any such Benefit Plan for any
period prior to the Closing Date are accrued on the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' books and records in accordance in all material respects with
GAAP.

  

  

(d) Each Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is
maintained under a prototype or volume submitter plan and may rely upon a
favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS with respect to such
prototype or volume submitter plan. To the Knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred that is reasonably likely to adversely affect such determination,
opinion, or advisory letter or cause such Benefit Plan to lose its tax-exempt
status.

  

  

(e) With respect to each applicable Benefit Plan: (i) no non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred that is reasonably likely to result in
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) there are
no actions, suits or claims pending, or threatened in writing or anticipated
(other than routine claims for benefits) against any such Benefit Plan or
fiduciary thereto or against the assets of any such Benefit Plan; (iii) there
are no audits, inquiries or Proceedings pending or threatened in writing by
any Governmental Authority with respect to any such Benefit Plan; (iv) no
matters are currently pending with respect to any such Benefit Plan under the
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System maintained by the IRS or any
similar program maintained by any other Governmental Authority; and (v) there
has been no breach of fiduciary duty (including violations under Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA) that has resulted or is reasonably likely to result in a
material Liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective employees.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) No Benefit Plan provides for health or life benefits for former directors,
officers or employees (or any spouse or former spouse or other dependent
thereof), other than benefits required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA, or similar provisions of state law.

  

  

(g) Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.8(g), none of the benefits under

the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, with
respect to any of the Benefit Plans, covered employees or qualified
beneficiaries that would be reasonably likely to result in a material
Liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(i) No Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any ERISA Affiliate thereof currently maintains, contributes to or
participates in, nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate thereof have any obligation to maintain, contribute to or otherwise
participate in, or have any Liability or other obligation (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) under, any (i) "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), (iii) "multiple employer welfare

Governmental Authority or furnished to employees with respect to any Benefit
Plan (including summary plan descriptions, Forms 5500 and summary annual
reports) have been timely filed or furnished and are accurate in all material
respects.

  

  

(k) The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents,
either alone or in combination with another event (where such event would not
alone have an effect described in this sentence), and the consummation of the
Transactions, will not (i) conflict with or result in any violation of or
default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation, modification, increase of
compensation payable or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit
under any Benefit Plan, trust or loan that will result in any material payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise or any bonus, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits), or acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, or vesting, (ii) result in any payment or provide any benefit by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would constitute an "excess
parachute payment", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the
Code, or (iii) result in a tax gross-up payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(l) Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.8(l), none of the Benefit Plans (i)

benefits to any Person, or (ii) obligates the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type
benefits solely as a result of any transaction.

  

  

(m) Each Benefit Plan, employment agreement, or other contract, plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been in compliance
in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable
guidance thereunder; and no additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code has been or is reasonably likely to be incurred by a participant in any
such Benefit Plan, employment agreement, or other contract, plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any ERISA Affiliate thereof, is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of
Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. No right to acquire the
membership interests or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) has an exercise price that was less than the fair market
value of the underlying equity as of the date such right was granted, (ii) has
any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise of disposition of such
right, or (iii) can be considered a class of securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is not "service recipient stock" (within the meaning
of applicable regulations under Section 409A of the Code).

  

  

(n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries thereof sponsors,
maintains or contributes to, or is obligated to contribute to, any material
Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the United States primarily for the
benefit of Persons substantially all of whom are "nonresident aliens" within

Government Contracts"); (ii) quotations, bids and proposals for awards of new
Government Contracts made by the Company or its Subsidiaries for which no
award has been made and for which the Company believes there is a reasonable
prospect that such an award to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may yet
be made (the "Government Contract Bids"); and (iii) Government Contracts
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently or is
reasonably expected to experience cost, schedule, technical or quality
problems that is reasonably expected to result in a claim or claims against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or its successors in interest) by a
Governmental Authority, a prime contractor or a higher-tier subcontractor, in
each case, except as would not result in suspension, debarment or economic
damages greater than $100,000. With respect to each Current Government
Contract, Schedule 3.14(a) accurately lists (A) the contract number, (B) the
award date and (C) the contract end date. With respect to each such Government
Contract Bid, Schedule 3.14(a) accurately lists: (A) the request for proposal
(RFP) number or, if such Government Contract Bid is for a task order under a
prime contract, the applicable prime contract number; (B) the date of proposal
submission; (C) the expected award date, if known; (D) the estimated period of
performance; and (E) the estimated value based on the proposal, if any. The
Company has delivered to the Buyer true and complete copies of all Current
Government Contracts and of all Government Contract Bids, including any and
all amendments and other modifications thereto and has provided the Buyer with
access to true and correct copies of all documentation related thereto
requested by the Buyer. All of the Current Government Contracts were legally
awarded, are binding on the parties thereto, and are in full force and effect.
The Current Government Contracts (or, where applicable, the prime Government
Contracts under which the Current Government Contracts were awarded) are not
currently the subject of bid or award protest Proceedings, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such Current Government Contracts (or, where
applicable, the prime Government Contracts under which the Current Government
Contracts were awarded) are reasonably likely to become the subject of bid or
award protest Proceedings. No Person has notified the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, orally that any
Governmental Authority, prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor under a
Current Government Contract intends to seek the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' agreement to lower rates under such Current Government Contract
or Government Contract Bids, including any task order under any Government
Contract Bids.

  

  

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects with all terms and conditions of each Current Government Contract and
Government Contract Bid to which it is a party, and has performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it thereunder.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with all statutory and
regulatory requirements to which it is subject, including under the Armed
Services Procurement Act, the Federal Procurement and Administrative Services
Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, any Federal Acquisition Regulation
("FAR"), any applicable agency-specific FAR supplement or acquisition
regulation and related cost principles and the Cost Accounting Standards,
where and as applicable to each of the Current Government Contracts and the
Government Contract Bids, except such non-compliance or non-performance as
would not result in any material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The representations, certifications and warranties made by the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Government Contracts
or Government Contract Bids were accurate as of their effective dates, and the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has fully complied in all material
respects with all such certifications. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received, in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
orally, a substantially adverse or negative government past performance
evaluation or rating that is reasonably expected to adversely affect the
evaluation by the Governmental Authority or other potential customer of the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' bids or proposals for future Government
Contracts.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) With respect to the Current Government Contracts, since December 31, 2008,
no Governmental Authority, prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor under
a Government Contract or any other Person has notified the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in writing, or to the Knowledge of the Company, orally, of
any actual or alleged material violation or breach by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of any statute, regulation, representation, certification,
disclosure obligation, contract term, condition, clause, provision or
specification under or with respect to the Procurement Integrity Act, the
Service Contract Act, the Trade Agreements Act and the Buy American Act.

  

  

(d) Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.14(d), none of the Current
Government Contracts or Government Contract Bids are premised upon the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' small business status, small
disadvantaged business status, protege status, or other preferential status,
nor did any Governmental Authority, or to the knowledge of the Company, prime
contractor or higher-tier subcontractor under a Current Government Contract
rely upon the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' small business status,
small disadvantaged business status, protege status, or other preferential
status in evaluating any of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
quotations, bids or proposals, or in making award of any Current Government
Contract to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each representation and/or
certification made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it was a
small business concern and/or was qualified for other preferential status in
each of its Government Contracts and Government Contract Bids was current and
accurate as of its effective date. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been required to recertify its small business status, small
disadvantaged business status, protege status or other preferential status in
connection with the submission or any proposal for, or award of, any Contract
or task order, delivery order, purchase order or subcontract issued related to
any small-business set-aside Contract. Schedule 3.14(d) identifies the set-
aside basis and the applicable NAICS codes that apply to the work being
provided.

  

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any litigation
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has taken any action that is reasonably
expected to give rise to (i) Liability under the False Claims Act, (ii) a
claim for price adjustment under the Truth in Negotiations Act or (iii) any
other request for a reduction in the price of any Government Contracts,
including claims based on actual or alleged defective pricing or actual or
alleged violations of price reduction clauses or provisions. To the Knowledge
of the Company, there exists no basis for a claim of any Liability of the
Company or its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority as a result of
defective cost and pricing data submitted to any Government Authority. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received in writing, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, orally, any allegations from employees, consultants
or independent contractors with respect to any alleged act or omission that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to (i) Liability under the False
Claims Act, (ii) a claim for price adjustment under the Truth in Negotiations
Act or (iii) any other request for a reduction in the price of any Government
Contracts, including to claims based on actual or alleged defective pricing.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has conducted or initiated any
internal investigation or made a voluntary or involuntary disclosure to any
Governmental Authority with respect to (i) Liability under the False Claims
Act, (ii) a claim for price adjustment under the Truth in Negotiations Act, or
(iii) any other request for a reduction in the price of any Current Government
Contracts, including claims based on actual or alleged defective pricing.

Company, oral show cause, cure, deficiency, default or similar notice relating
to Current Government Contracts; (ii) no termination for default, cure notice
or show cause notice has been issued or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened and remains unresolved with respect to any Current Government
Contract or Government Contract Bid, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event, condition or omission has occurred or exists that would constitute
grounds for such action; (iii) no past performance evaluation received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such Government
Contract sets forth a material default or other material failure to perform
thereunder or termination or default thereof; (iv) there has not been any
material withholding or setoff under any Current Government Contract; and (v)
all invoices and claims (including requests for progress payments and
provisional costs payments) submitted under each Current Government Contract
were accurate and complete in all material respects as of their submission
date and (vi) none of the execution, delivery or performance of the
Transaction Documents does or will conflict with or result in a breach of or
default under any Government Contract or cause a termination of any Government
Contract due to loss of preferential status. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral notice terminating any of the Current Government Contracts for
convenience or indicating an intent to terminate any of the Current Government
Contracts for convenience.

  

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice of any outstanding claims or
Contract disputes to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(i) relating to the Current Government Contracts or Government Contract Bids
and involving a Governmental Authority or any prime contractor, higher-tier
subcontractor, vendor or other third party or (ii) relating to the Current
Government Contracts under the Contract Disputes Act or any other federal
statute.

  

  

(h) During the six (6) year period ending on the date hereof, (A) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Members or their respective managers,
trustees, directors, officers, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, employees,
in each case in connection with the performance of their duties for or on
behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Members has been
debarred, suspended or proposed for suspension or debarment from bidding on
any Government Contract, declared nonresponsible or ineligible or otherwise

suspension or exclusion Proceeding has been initiated against the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, the Members or any of their respective managers,
trustees, directors, officers, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, employees
in connection with the performance of their duties for or on behalf of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Members. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no circumstances exist that would warrant the institution of
suspension or debarment Proceedings against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of the Members or any of their Representatives in connection
with the performance of their duties for or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(k) Within the last six years (i) except for routine audits in the ordinary

conducted any internal investigation or audit in connection with which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has used any legal counsel, auditor,

(r) No Current Government Contract has incurred costs materially in excess of
the total ceiling price, cost ceiling or funding ceiling of such Government
Contract as amended (each, an "overrun"). No payment has been made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by a Person acting on the Company's or

the applicable FAR or agency supplement thereto and, to the extent applicable,
allocable in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards (except for costs

Contract.

3.17 Material Contracts.

  

  

(a) Schedule 3.17 sets forth an accurate and complete list of each Material
Contract. The Company has provided the Buyer with a true, correct and complete
copy of each Material Contract required to be disclosed herein. No Material
Contract has been materially breached (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) or cancelled by the other party, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no anticipated material breach by any other party to any
Contract (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both). The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has performed in all material respects all of the
obligations required to be performed by it under the Material Contracts and is
not in material default under or in material breach of any Material Contract,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, assuming that all notices, filings,
approvals and consents set forth on Schedule 3.3 are made or obtained, no
event has occurred that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would: (i) result in a "default" or "event of default" giving rise to a
right of termination or a material breach under any Material Contract by the
Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) give any Person (other than the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries) the right to declare a default" or "event of default"
giving rise to a right of termination under any Material Contract; (iii) give
any Person (other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries) the right to
accelerate the maturity or performance of any material obligation under any
Material Contract; or (iv) give any Person (other than the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries) the right to cancel, terminate or materially and adversely
to the Company and its Subsidiaries modify any Material Contract. Since the

any of its material rights under any Material Contract, nor, to the Knowledge
of the Company, does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any present
expectation or intention of not fully performing any obligation pursuant to
any Material Contract. Each Material Contract is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect against the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto, except in each case, as enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions and, assuming the filings, notices, approvals
and consent set forth on Schedule 3.3 are made or obtained, shall continue as
such immediately following the consummation of the Transactions. No Material
Contract obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to process,
manufacture or deliver products or perform services that are reasonably
expected to result in a loss to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon
completion of performance. Schedule 3.17 contains an accurate and complete
description of all material terms of all oral Material Contracts.

Subsidiaries has at all times since December 31, 2008 conducted its business
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws.
None of the properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries contain any Hazardous Substance in amounts
exceeding the levels permitted by applicable Environmental Laws except, in
each case, as would not result in material Liability to the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notices,
demand letters or requests for information from any Governmental Authority or
other Person that have not heretofore been resolved with such Governmental
Authority or other Person, indicating that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental Law.
There are no Proceedings pending or threatened in writing against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any violation, or alleged violation, of
any Environmental Law (excluding any such Proceedings believed in good faith
by Company management to be meritless). No reports have been filed or are
required to be filed, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the
actual or threatened Release of any Hazardous Substance or violation of any
Environmental Law that have not heretofore been resolved. No Release or
threatened Release of any Hazardous Substance by the Company or any Subsidiary
has occurred or is occurring, at, on, under, from or to any property or
facility currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by any of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of any applicable Environmental Law,
and no Hazardous Substance is present in, on, under or about, or is migrating
to or from any property currently owned, operated or leased by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any property
formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in violation of any applicable Environmental Law, except, in each case, as
would not give rise to any material Liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). No remediation or investigation of Hazardous
Substances is occurring at any property currently owned or operated, or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, formerly owned or operated, by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company and its properties, nor any of
the Company's Subsidiaries and their properties, are subject to any

surveys, assessments, audits, investigations, analysis, tests, and other
similar documents (whether in hard copy or electronic form) in the Company's

3.19 Insurance. Schedule 3.19 lists each current insurance policy maintained
by or at the expense of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any claims
made thereunder in the one year period prior to the date hereof. All such
insurance policies are in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in default with respect to its obligations under
any such insurance policies. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has ever been denied insurance coverage since December 31, 2011. The insurance
coverage of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is customary for Persons

any actual or (a) possible cancellation or invalidation of any such insurance
policy, (b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material claim under
any insurance policy or (c) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums
payable with respect to any insurance policy. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any self-insurance or co-insurance programs. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition, situation or circumstance
that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would give rise to or
serve as a basis for any claim under any policy listed in Schedule 3.19,
except as set forth in such Schedule.

any of its Subsidiaries, that involves a claim of infringement, unauthorized
use or violation of any Company Owned Intellectual Property, or challenging
the ownership, right to use, sell, distribute, license or sublicense, validity
or enforceability of any Company Owned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge
of the Company, the operation of the business as it is currently conducted
does not infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property rights of any
Person or constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of
any jurisdiction, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any Person claiming that such operation infringes
or misappropriates any Intellectual Property rights of any Person or
constitutes unfair competitions or trade practices under the Laws of any
jurisdiction. To the Knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing
upon or misappropriating, any Company Owned Intellectual Property or any
Company Licensed Intellectual Property that is exclusively licensed to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable
security measures to protect its trade secrets used in and material to its
business and otherwise safeguard and maintain the confidential and proprietary
nature of all confidential information used by it in and material to the

security. No written complaint relating to an improper use or disclosure of,
or a breach in the security of, any such information has been received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or threatened in writing against the

been no material: (i) unauthorized disclosure of any third party proprietary
or confidential information in the possession, custody or control of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) breach of the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' security procedures wherein confidential information has
been disclosed to a third Person.

  

  

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, all technical data, computer software and
computer software documentation (as those terms are defined under the Federal
Acquisition Regulation and its supplemental regulations) that constitutes
material Company Owned Intellectual Property in connection with the Government
Contracts have been properly and sufficiently marked and protected so that no
material rights or licenses required under applicable regulations and
Government Contract terms, if any, have been provided.

  

  

3.21 Related Person Transactions. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.21, (i)
since December 31, 2013, other than with respect to advancements, or
obligations to reimburse, expenses or travel allowances and similar items in
the ordinary course of business or with respect to remuneration for services
rendered in the ordinary course of business as an employee, manager, director

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to or for any of the Members or their
Related Persons, (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no officer or director

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract or other
commitment or transaction with any Member or their Related Persons except as

"Related Person Transaction"), nor do any Related Persons have any legal or
beneficial interest in the assets or property owned or used by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in any Contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, (iv) other than advancements, or obligations to
reimburse, expenses or travel allowances and similar items in the ordinary
course of business or with respect to remuneration for services rendered in
the ordinary course of business as an employee, manager, director or officer

since December 31, 2013, there has been no material amendment to any Related
Person Transaction, (vi) the terms and conditions of any Related Person

arm's-length basis, and (vii) no Related Person conducts any of the Company's
or any of its Subsidiaries' business, directly or indirectly, other than
through the Members' collective ownership or in his or her capacity as a

As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, and to
consummate the Transactions, except as set forth on the correspondingly
numbered section or subsection of the disclosure schedules delivered by the
Company and the Members to Parent and the Buyer concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Schedules") (it being
agreed that the disclosure of any item in one section or subsection thereof
shall be deemed included on any other section or subsection, and to modify
each other representation and warranty (even if such representation and
warranty does not reference the Company Schedules) to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent on its face), each of the Members severally,
and not jointly, represents and warrants to the Buyer, with respect only to
such Member, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

right and capacity to enter into and perform such Member's obligations under
the Transaction Documents to which such Member is or will be a party and to
consummate the Transactions pursuant thereto. The Transaction Documents to
which such Member is a party have been, or will be, duly executed and
delivered by such Member and, assuming the due execution and delivery by the
other parties thereto, are, or will be, legal, valid and binding obligations
of such Member, enforceable against such Member in accordance with their
respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exceptions.

  

  

4.2 No Violation to Result. Other than with respect to the Securities Laws or
as may be required by reason of Buyer's or Parent's participation in the
Transactions, and assuming all consents or filings set forth on Schedule 3.3

Transaction Documents to which such Member is a Party, and the consummation by
such Member of the Transactions pursuant thereto, do not and will not,

violate, breach, conflict with, constitute a default under, accelerate or
permit the acceleration of the performance required by any (i) Contract to
which such Member is a party or by which such Member or such Member's assets
are bound, or (ii) Law or other legal requirement of any Governmental
Authority applicable to such Member or (b) result in the creation or
imposition of any Encumbrance or restriction (other than as expressly provided
in the Transaction Documents) in favor of any Person (other than the Buyer)
upon any of the Acquired Units of such Member, except, in the case of the
foregoing clause (a), as is not reasonably expected to materially impair or
impede such Member's obligations under the Transaction Documents or ability to
consummate the Transactions. No notice to, filing with, or consent of any
Person is necessary in connection with, or will be triggered by, the
execution, delivery or performance by such Member of the Transaction Documents
to which such Member is a Party or the consummation by such Member of the
Transactions pursuant thereto, in each case, except under Securities Laws and
as is not reasonably expected to materially impair or impede such Member's
obligations under the Transaction Documents or ability to consummate the
Transactions. The consummation of the Reorganization on the terms contemplated
by the Restructuring Agreement will not violate the Securities Act or
otherwise require the registration of any securities issued in connection
therewith.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.3 Ownership.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof (without giving effect to the Reorganization) the
Members, or entities that are, direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of
the Members, are the sole owners of the capital stock or other equity
interests in each Subsidiary, free and clear of any Encumbrance (other than
restrictions imposed by Securities Laws or the applicable organizational
documents of such entities).

  

  

(b) Upon the consummation of the Reorganization, such Member will be the sole
record and beneficial holder of the number of Acquired Units as are set forth
opposite such Member's name on Schedule 3.4(a), free and clear of any
Encumbrance (other than restrictions imposed by Securities Laws or the
organizational documents of the Company and the Transaction Documents). There
are no proxies, voting rights, members agreements or other agreements or
understandings, to which such Member is a party or by which such Member is
bound, with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company Units other than
the operating agreement and other organizational documents of the Company, the
Restructuring Agreement and the other agreements to be delivered in connection
therewith and this Agreement.

  

  

4.4 Accredited Investor.

  

  

(a) Such Member represents that it is an "accredited investor" as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

  

  

(b) Such Member represents that it is acquiring the Buyer Units for investment
(for its own account or for accounts over which it exercises investment
control), and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof, which would be in violation of the Securities Act or any
applicable state securities law. The acquisition by such Member of any of the
Buyer Units shall constitute confirmation of the representation by such Member
that such Member does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such
person or to any third person, with respect to any of the Buyer Units.

  

  

(c) Such Member represents that it has reviewed all the information it
considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to acquire the Buyer
Units. Such Member further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers regarding the terms and conditions of the
Transactions.

  

  

(d) Such Member acknowledges that it can bear the economic risk of its
investment, and has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in financial
or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
the investment in the Buyer Units and fully understands the limitations on
transfer described above. Such Member acknowledges that any investment in the
Buyer Units involves a high degree of risk, and represents that it is able,
without materially impairing its financial condition, to hold the Buyer Units
for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of its
investment.

  

  

4.5 Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. None of the Executive Employees own of record or
beneficially any Parent Warrants.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

  

 

  

4.6 Brokers. Other than BBandT Capital Markets and/or BBandT Securities LLC, no
Person has or will have, as a result of the Transactions, any right, interest
or claim against or upon the Buyer, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, such
Member or any of their respective Affiliates for any commission, finder's fee
or other compensation payable as a finder or broker resulting or arising from
any agreement entered into by such Member.

  

  

4.7 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article III or this Article IV, no Seller Party or any other
Person on behalf of a Seller Party makes any express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their business or
the equity or ownership therein or with respect to any other information
provided, or made available, to Parent, the Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, agents or Representatives in connection with the Transactions. The
Seller Parties disclaim any and all other representations and warranties,
whether express or implied, not contained in Article III or this Article IV.

  

  

4.8 Investigation. Such Member acknowledges that the detailed representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement have been negotiated at arm's
length among sophisticated business entities. In entering into this Agreement,
such Member has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties regarding Parent and the Buyer expressly
contained in Article V. Except for such representations and warranties, such
Member acknowledges that none of Parent, the Buyer, any member, Representative
or Affiliate of any of them or any Person acting on behalf of any of the
foregoing makes or has made any other express or implied representation or
warranty to such Member. Such Member further agrees that, absent fraud, none
of Parent or the Buyer or any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to such Member or any other Person resulting from the distribution
to such Member, or such Member's use, of any information, including any
information, document or material made available or provided to such Member or
its Representatives in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for the remedies of such Member set forth herein.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER AND PARENT

  

  

As a material inducement to the Seller Parties to enter into this Agreement,
and to consummate the Transactions, except as set forth in the Parent SEC
Reports or on the correspondingly numbered section or subsection of the
disclosure schedules delivered by Parent and the Buyer to the Company and the
Members concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Buyer Schedules") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any item in one
section or subsection thereof shall be deemed included on any other section or
subsection, and to modify each other representation and warranty (even if such
representation and warranty does not reference the Buyer Schedules) to which
the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face), the Buyer and
Parent each represent and warrant to the Members as follows:

  

  

5.1 Organization.

  

  

(a) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified to do
business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character or
location of its assets or properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified, registered or in good standing is not reasonably
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has full
corporate power and authority and all material licenses, permits and
authorizations necessary to own and operate its properties and to conduct its
business as conducted.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Buyer is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified
to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
or location of its assets or properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified, registered or in good standing is not reasonably
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer. The Buyer has
full corporate power and authority and all material licenses, permits and
authorizations necessary to own and operate its properties and to conduct its
business as conducted.

  

  

5.2 Authority for Agreement. Subject to receipt of the Required Parent
Stockholder Approval, Parent and the Buyer each has full corporate power and
authority to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which Parent or the Buyer is or will be a party and
to consummate the Transactions. The sole member and the manager of the Buyer
has authorized the execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the Transactions. The Board of Directors of

"Parent Board"), at a meeting duly called and held, has, as of the date of
this Agreement, unanimously (a) approved and declared the advisability of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions, (b)
determined that this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
Transactions are in the best interests of the Buyer, Parent and its
stockholders, (c) authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and the Buyer and (d) adopted and approved, and directed the submission
to holders of Parent Common Stock for their approval, the other Required
Approval Matters and has provided the Members a true, correct and complete
copy of each such approval, determination and authorization. Subject to
receipt of the Required Parent Stockholder Approval, the Warrant Tender Offer
and the Redemption Offer, no other corporate or limited liability company
proceedings on the part of Parent or the Buyer are, or will be, necessary to
approve and authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Transactions. The
Transaction Documents to which Parent or the Buyer is a party have been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, and are legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent and the Buyer, as applicable,
enforceable against Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, in accordance with
their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. Subject to receipt of the Required Parent
Stockholder Extension Approval, Parent has full corporate power and authority
to enter into and perform the respective obligations under the Extension
Documents to which Parent is a party and to consummate the Extension and the
transactions contemplated thereby and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent are, or will be, necessary to approve and authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of the Extension Documents and the
consummation of the Extension.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.3 No Violation to Result. Other than with respect to the Securities Laws or
as may be required by reason of the Seller Parties' participation in the
Transactions, and assuming all consents or filings set forth on Schedule 5.3
are obtained or made, the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and
the Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which each is a party, and the
consummation by Parent of the Extension and by Parent and the Buyer of the
Transactions, do not and will not, directly or indirectly (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both): (a) violate, breach, conflict with,
constitute a default under or accelerate or permit the acceleration of the
performance required by (i) any of the terms of the Organizational Documents
or any resolution adopted by the Parent Board or the stockholders of Parent,

organizational document of the Buyer or any resolution adopted by the managers
of the Buyer or members of the Buyer, (iii) any contract or agreement (whether
written or oral) to which the Buyer or Parent is a party or by which either of
them or their assets are bound or (iv) any Law or other legal requirement of
any Governmental Authority applicable to Parent or the Buyer; (b) give any
Governmental Authority or other Person the right to declare a default or
exercise any remedy or accelerate performance or maturity under any contract
or agreement (whether written or oral) or cancel, terminate or modify any such
contract or agreement; or (c) result in the creation or imposition of any
material Encumbrance or restriction (other than as expressly provided in the
Transaction Documents) in favor of any Person upon any of the Buyer Units
under any contract or agreement (whether written or oral) entered into by
Parent or the Buyer or any of the material properties or material assets of
Parent or the Buyer, except, in the case of (a)(iii) and (a)(iv), where the
failure of such representation to be true and correct is not material to
Parent and the Buyer (taken as a whole). No notice to, filing with, or consent
of any Person is necessary in connection with, and no "change of control"
provision in any contract or agreement (whether written or oral) or otherwise
is, or will be, triggered by, the authorization, approval, execution, delivery
or performance by Parent of the Extension Documents or the consummation by
Parent of the Extension or by Parent and the Buyer of the Transaction
Documents or the consummation by Parent and the Buyer of the Transactions,
except for (y) the actions to be taken in connection with the Proxy
Solicitation, the Extension Proxy Solicitation, the Warrant Tender Offer or

5.4 SEC Reports; Internal Controls and Procedures.

  

  

(a) Parent has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports, schedules,
statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed or otherwise
transmitted, as applicable, by it since Parent's formation, and will file or
otherwise transmit all forms, reports, schedules, statements, certifications
and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto) required to be filed or otherwise transmitted, as applicable, by it
subsequent to the date of this Agreement through and including the Closing
Date, with the SEC (such documents, the "Parent SEC Reports"), and such Parent
SEC Reports are, or will be, as applicable, available in full without
redaction on the SEC's website through EDGAR. As of their respective dates,
each of the Parent SEC Reports complied, or will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of all applicable Laws, including
without limitation the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and the respective rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. Except to the extent
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC, as of their
respective dates (and if so amended or superseded, then on the date of such
subsequent filing), none of the Parent SEC Reports contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by Parent relating to the
Parent SEC Reports. Parent has heretofore made available to the Seller
Parties, through EDGAR or otherwise, true, correct and complete copies of all
material written correspondence between Parent and the SEC. None of the Parent
SEC Reports is, to the Knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

(b) The financial statements (including in all cases the notes thereto, if
any) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports (i) in all material
respects, were prepared consistent with Parent's books and records, (ii) in
all material respects, present fairly the financial position of Parent as of
the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of
Parent for the periods thereof, and (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP; provided, that, any unaudited, interim period financial statements
need not include footnote disclosures and other presentation items or year-end
adjustments that are required by GAAP to be included in year-end financial
statements, and (iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the SEC, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(c) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent's disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of Parent's board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Parent's ability to report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parent's internal control over financial
reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to
auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Seller Parties prior to the date
hereof.

  

  

5.5 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof and immediately prior to the Closing, Parent is the
sole record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests or other equity securities of the Buyer. Immediately
following the Closing, (i) all of the issued and outstanding Buyer Units will
have been duly authorized and validly issued, and be fully paid and non-
assessable; (ii) all of the outstanding Buyer Units will be, free and clear of
any Encumbrances (other than as expressly provided in the Transaction

redemption, preemptive rights, proxies, membership agreements, rights of first
refusal or other similar agreements or rights exist with respect to the Buyer
Units, and no such rights arise by virtue of or in connection with the
Transactions (other than pursuant to the Transaction Documents).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of (A) 30,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock, of which 9,750,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(less, following the date hereof, any shares of Parent Common Stock redeemed
pursuant to the Redemption Offer) shall be issued and outstanding and (B)
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Parent
Preferred Stock"), of which no shares of Parent Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding, and, except with respect to the creation of the Class B Parent
Shares pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Parent Certificate, the
Class B Parent Shares to be issued to the Members pursuant to Article I
following receipt of the Required Parent Stockholder Approval and the Parent
Warrants, no other capital stock or other equity securities in Parent are
authorized, issued or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
Capital Stock or other equity securities in Parent have been duly authorized
and validly issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable. No restrictions on
transfer, repurchase option, right of redemption, preemptive rights, proxies,
membership agreements, rights of first refusal or other similar agreements or
rights exist with respect to any capital stock or other equity securities in
Parent, in each case, other than as set forth in the Parent Organizational
Documents. Other than the Supporting Stockholder Agreement and that certain
Letter Agreement, dated December 13, 2012, by and among Parent and the
Underwriters and Insiders party thereto (including, as such Letter Agreement
is amended and restated in connection with the Extension), there are no voting
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements, commitments or understandings
with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity securities of
Parent.

  

  

(c) Neither Parent nor the Buyer is a party to, and to the Knowledge of
Parent, none of their members or shareholders is, as of the date hereof, a
party to, any: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call, warrant or right
(whether or not currently exercisable) to acquire or sell or issue any
membership interests, capital stock or other equity securities of Parent or
the Buyer; (ii) outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may
become convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any membership
interests, capital stock or other equity securities of Parent or the Buyer;
(iii) contract, agreement or other arrangement (whether written or oral) under
which Parent or the Buyer is or may become obligated to acquire, sell or
otherwise issue any of their membership interests, capital stock or other
equity securities; or (iv) contract, agreement or other arrangement (whether
written or oral) that contains a right that is subject to a condition or
circumstance the occurrence of which would give rise to or provide a basis for
the assertion of a claim by any Person to the effect that such Person is
entitled to acquire or receive any membership interest, capital stock or other
equity securities of Parent or the Buyer, in each case, except for the Parent
Warrants and other than as set forth in the operating agreement or other
organizational documents of the Buyer or in the Parent Organizational
Documents, as applicable, including, without limitation, the Redemption Offer
and the Warrant Tender Offer and except as set forth in the Transaction
Documents. There are no outstanding restricted securities, phantom securities
or other equity-based compensation arrangements, profit participation or other
similar rights with respect to Parent or the Buyer and to which they are a
party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) All membership interests, capital stock or other equity securities of
Parent and the Buyer have been issued in compliance with all requirements of
their respective organizational documents and any applicable Securities Laws
and other applicable securities law requirements, including, without
limitation, with respect to Parent, any rules or regulations of Nasdaq.

  

  

(e) The Buyer Units and Class B Parent Shares to be issued to the Members
pursuant to this Agreement will, when issued, have been duly authorized and
validly issued, and be fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear of any
Encumbrances other than applicable Securities Laws and the terms of the other
Transaction Documents. The shares of capital stock of Parent (the "Parent
Exchange Shares") to be issued upon the redemption of the Buyer Units pursuant
to the Buyer LLC Agreement will, when issued, have been duly authorized and
validly issued, and be fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear of any
Encumbrances. No restrictions on transfer, repurchase option, right of
redemption, preemptive rights, proxies, stockholder agreements, rights of
first refusal or other agreements or rights will exist with respect to the
Parent Exchange Shares.

  

  

(f) Other than Parent's ownership of Buyer or as set forth in the Transaction
Documents, neither Parent nor the Buyer has (i) any equity or other ownership
interest in any Person, (ii) any commitments to contribute to the capital of,
or make loans to or share losses of, any third Person.

  

  

5.6 Listing. The Parent Common Stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market
("Nasdaq"). There is no action or proceeding pending or threatened in writing
against Parent by Nasdaq with respect to any intention by such entity to
prohibit or terminate the quotation of such securities thereon.

  

  

5.7 Trust Fund. As of the date of this Agreement, at least $77,250,000 of
funds are held in the Trust Funds established for the benefit of the public
stockholders and warrant holders of Parent, as applicable, and such monies are
being held in trust in accordance with that certain Investment Management
Trust Agreement, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the "Trustee"), dated December 13, 2012 and that certain Escrow
Agreement by and among Parent, Joseph Wright, Cowen Overseas Investment LP,
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, Deutsche Bank Securities and Cowen
and Company LLC, dated December 13, 2012 (collectively, the "Trust
Agreements"). The Trust Agreements are valid and in full force and effect and
enforceable in accordance with their terms and have not been amended or
modified except, as of the Closing Date, as amended in connection with the
Extension substantially in the form previously provided to the Company. There
are no separate agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings
(whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the
descriptions of the Trust Agreements in the Parent SEC Reports to be
inaccurate in any material respect and/or that would entitle any Person (other
than as set forth in the Trust Agreement, as contemplated by the Extension
Documents or Permitted Parent Leakage) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Funds. Following the Closing and notice thereof to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall be obligated to release as promptly as practicable all funds
held in the Trust Funds to Parent, and, thereafter, the Trust Funds shall
terminate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42

right, interest or claim against or upon Parent, the Buyer, the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of the Members or any of their respective
Affiliates for any commission, fee or other compensation payable as a finder
or broker resulting or arising from any act or omission by Parent or the
Buyer.

  

  

5.10 Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending or threatened in writing
against or affecting Parent, the Buyer or their assets before any court,
agency, authority or arbitration tribunal. Neither Parent nor the Buyer has
received any opinion or legal advice to the effect that it is exposed from a
legal standpoint to any Liability or disadvantage that may be material to the
business of Parent or the Buyer as previously or presently conducted or as
presently proposed to be conducted. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
facts that would likely result in any such Proceeding. Neither Parent nor the
Buyer nor any of their officers or other employees is subject to or in default
with respect to any notice, order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Authority or arbitration tribunal.

  

  

5.11 Compliance with Laws. Each of Parent and the Buyer has, in all material
respects, complied at all times and is currently in compliance with all Laws

the anti-fraud provisions of the Contract Disputes Act, the Small Business
Act, the Anti-Kickback Act, the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Sherman
Act, the Clayton Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Services Contract
Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, and the Byrd Amendment (31 U.S.C. § 1352).
Neither Parent nor the Buyer, nor any of the employees, partners, principals,
agents or assignees of Parent or the Buyer have committed (or taken any action
to promote or conceal) any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15
U.S.C. sections 78dd-1, -2, or any equivalent foreign Law or otherwise paid or
made any bribe, illegal rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other
unlawful payment. Parent and the Buyer have all material licenses, permits,
approvals, qualifications or the like, from any Governmental Authority or any
Person used in, necessary for or related to the conduct of their businesses as
conducted or as presently proposed to be conducted, all such items are in full
force and effect and each of Parent and the Buyer is and has at all times been
in compliance with the terms thereof. Neither Parent nor the Buyer has
received any allegations from employees, consultants or independent
contractors with respect to any alleged act or omission arising under or
relating to any noncompliance with Law, and has not conducted or initiated any
internal investigation or made a voluntary or involuntary disclosure to any
Governmental Authority with respect to any alleged act or omission arising
under or relating to any noncompliance with Law. Neither Parent nor the Buyer
has received any notice or citation for any actual or potential noncompliance
with any of the foregoing in this Section 5.11, and there exists no condition,
situation or circumstance that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute noncompliance with or give rise to future Liability with regard to
any of the foregoing in this Section 5.11.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.12 Parent Contracts.

  

  

(a) Except as filed as an exhibit to a Parent SEC Report filed prior to the
date of this Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 5.12(a) (if requested, a
true, correct and complete copy of each of which has been made available to
the Company), there are no contracts, agreements or obligations of any kind,
whether written or oral, to which Parent is a party or by or to which any of
the properties or assets of Parent may be bound, subject or affected, which
(i) creates or imposes a liability greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000), or (ii) includes, as a party or beneficiary, any Founder or any
Affiliate thereof (the "Parent Contracts")

  

  

(b) No Parent Contract has been breached or cancelled by the other party, and,
to the Knowledge of the Parent, there is no anticipated breach by any other
party to any such Parent Contract (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both). Parent has performed all of the material obligations required to be
performed by it in connection with such Parent Contracts and is not in default
under or in breach of any such Parent Contract, and no event has occurred that
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would: (i) result in
a "default" or "event of default" giving rise to a right of termination or
breach under any such Parent Contract; (ii) give any Person the right to
declare a default" or "event of default" giving rise to a right of termination
or the right to exercise any remedy under any such Parent Contract; (iii) give
any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any such
Parent Contract; or (iv) give any Person the right to cancel, terminate or
materially modify any such Parent Contract. Parent has not waived any of its
material rights under any such Parent Contract, and does not have any present
expectation or intention of not fully performing any obligation pursuant to
any such Parent Contract. Each such Parent Contract is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect against Parent and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as enforceability may be limited
by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions and assuming the filings, notices,
approvals and consents set forth on Schedule 5.3 are made or obtained, and
shall continue as such immediately following the consummation of the
Transactions. No such Parent Contract obligates Parent to process, manufacture
or deliver products or perform services that are reasonably expected to result
in a loss to Parent upon completion of performance.

  

  

(c) No Person is currently renegotiating, or has the right to renegotiate, any
amount paid or payable to or by Parent under any Parent Contract or any other
term or provision of any Parent Contract.

  

  

5.13 Taxes. Parent and the Buyer have each filed (or has had filed on its
behalf) on a timely basis all material Tax Returns it is required to have

paid by Parent and the Buyer (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have
been paid on a timely basis.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.14 Parent Information. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference: (i) in any Report on Form 8-K and any exhibits

any agreements ancillary thereto or (ii) in the Public Disclosure Documents
and/or any distributions to or communications with the holders of Parent
Common Stock with respect to the Extension Proxy Solicitation, the Proxy
Solicitation, the Warrant Tender Offer and/or the Redemption Offer, or in any
amendment to any of the documents identified in (i) or (ii), will, (A) when
filed, made available, distributed or communicated or (B) with respect to the
information expressly provided for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Extension Proxy Solicitation or the Proxy Statement, at the time of the
applicable Special Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (subject to any
qualifications and limitations expressly set forth in the materials provided
by Parent or that are included in such filings, distributions or
communications). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Buyer
makes any representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information
or statements supplied or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Members
or any of their Affiliates.

  

  

5.15 Organizational Documents. Parent has made available to the Company
through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System
("EDGAR") or otherwise true, correct and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the Trust Agreement (collectively, the "Parent
Organizational Documents"), as amended through the date hereof. Parent is not
in violation of any of the provisions of the Parent Organizational Documents.
The copies of the organizational documents of the Buyer that have been made
available to the Company reflect all amendments made thereto at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement and are true, correct and complete.

  

  

5.16 Buyer Obligations. Buyer has no liabilities, debts or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,
unasserted or otherwise) except those incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
Transactions, and, other than the Transaction Documents, Buyer has not agreed
to and is not obligated to make, nor is bound by, any written, oral or other
agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument,
note, option, warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy.

  

  

5.17 Investment Company Act. Parent is not an "investment company" or a Person
directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on behalf of an "investment
company" within the meaning of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

5.18 Investigation. Buyer and Parent acknowledge that the detailed
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement have been
negotiated at arm's length among sophisticated business entities. In entering
into this Agreement, Buyer and Parent have relied solely upon their own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties regarding
(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries expressly contained in Article III and
(ii) the Members expressly contained in Article IV. Except for such
representations and warranties, Parent and the Buyer acknowledge that none of
the Seller Parties or any member, Representative or Affiliate of any of them
or any Person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing makes or has made any
other express or implied representation or warranty to Parent or the Buyer.
Buyer and Parent further agree that, absent fraud, none of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, the Seller Parties or any Member or any other Person shall
have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or Parent or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Buyer or Parent, or Buyer's or Parent's
use, of any information, including any information, document or material made
available or provided to Buyer or Parent or their Representatives in certain
"data rooms," management presentations, offering or information memoranda or
any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
for the remedies of the Buyer and Parent set forth herein. Without limitation,
in connection with Buyer's and Parent's investigation of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their business, Buyer and Parent have received from or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or the Members certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain business plan information for such fiscal years. Buyer and Parent
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer and Parent
are familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer and Parent are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts), and that Buyer and Parent shall not have any claim
against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Members or any
Representative or Affiliate of any of them and/or any Person acting on behalf
of any of the foregoing with respect thereto.

Law, (ii) previously known without violation of Law or any confidentiality

the other Parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is reasonably expected to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party contained herein to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing and (ii) any
failure of such Party to comply with in any material respect any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder, in the
case of each of (i) and (ii) above, to the extent that such party becomes
aware of such matter, or, in the case of the Company, to the extent of the

this Section 6.4 shall not be deemed to (x) modify the representations or
warranties hereunder of any Party, (y) modify the conditions set forth in

50  

  

 

 

  

 

  

6.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Tax Returns. The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) each Tax Return required to be filed
by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for a taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date (each a "Buyer Prepared Return"). The
cost of preparation of Buyer Prepared Returns shall be paid by the Company at
the direction of the Members' Representative. To the extent any Tax shown as
due on any Buyer Prepared Return is payable by the Members (including by
reason of the indemnification obligations of the Members hereunder), (A) each
such Buyer Prepared Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise required
by applicable Tax Law or the change from prior practice would not increase the
amount of Tax payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries for which the Members
are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.1,
(B) each such Buyer Prepared Return shall be provided to the Members'
Representative for review at least fifteen (15) days before the due date for
filing such Buyer Prepared Return (or, if required to be filed within thirty
(30) days after the Closing or within thirty (30) days after the end of the
taxable period to which such Tax Return relates, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing) and (C) the Members' Representative shall
have the right to review and comment on each such Buyer Prepared Return before
filing. The Buyer shall make such revisions to the Buyer Prepared Returns as
are reasonably requested by the Members' Representative. The Members shall
include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for the Company
and its Subsidiaries on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Schedules K-1 furnished to the Members with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and fully satisfy any Tax liabilities arising from such
inclusion.

  

  

(b) The Parties shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat the
taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries as ending at the close of
business on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, Company Taxes
incurred with respect to a taxable period that includes, but does not end on,
the Closing Date, shall be allocated to the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date (i) except as provided in (ii) and (iii) below, to the extent
feasible, on a specific identification basis, according to the date of the
event or transaction giving rise to the Tax, (ii) except as provided in (iii)
below, with respect to periodically assessed ad valorem Taxes and Taxes not
otherwise feasibly allocable to specific transactions or events, in proportion
to the number of days in such period occurring before the Closing Date
compared to the total number of days in such period, and (iii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the
Tax that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) The Members' Representative, the Members, the Company and the Buyer shall
cooperate, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party hereto in connection the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns as provided herein and any Proceeding
with respect to Taxes and preparation of financial statements. Such
cooperation shall include the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Proceeding with respect to Taxes
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Members' Representative, the Buyer and the Company shall, and the Company
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) retain all books and records with respect
to Company Taxes (including Tax Returns) relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until ninety (90) days after the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (including waivers and extensions)
for assessment of Taxes to which such books and records are relevant and (ii)
give the other Parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if another Party so
requests, allow such other Party to take possession of or copy such books and
records.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause all
obligations that it or any of its Subsidiaries has under all Tax sharing
agreements or similar agreements to be terminated on or before the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

  

  

(e) Any Party who receives any notice of a pending or threatened Tax
Proceeding against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that may give rise to Liability of another Party hereto, shall promptly notify
such other Party after receipt of such notice; provided, however, that any
failure on the part of the Buyer to so notify the Members' Representative
shall not limit any of the obligations of any of the Members or the Members'
Representative, or any of the rights of any Indemnified Party, under Article
IX (except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such failure increases
the costs or liability of the Indemnifying Party under Article IX). The
Parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other Parties hereto
informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any Tax Proceeding to the
extent that such Proceeding could affect a Liability of such other Parties
(including indemnity obligations hereunder). The Parent shall have the right
to control all Tax Proceedings relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except that in the event such Tax Proceeding pertains to items
reportable on income Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of the Members) for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
the Members' Representative shall have the right to conduct any such Tax
Proceeding through counsel of the Members' Representative' choice in the same
manner, and subject to the same limitations, as provided in Sections 9.2(a)
and 9.2(b); provided, however, that the Parent shall be entitled to
participate in any Tax Proceeding conducted by the Members' Representative, at
Parent's sole expense, and the Members' Representative may not settle or
compromise any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Neither Parent, the Buyer nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall enter into any agreement with the relevant Taxing Authority pertaining
to such income Tax Proceeding conducted by the Members' Representative without
the written consent of the Members' Representative, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent not
inconsistent with this Section 6.5, the provisions of Article IX shall govern
the manner in which Tax Proceedings are conducted and resolved.

  

  

6.6 Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any charge, complaint or other Proceeding by
any Person that is not a Party in connection with (i) any of the Transactions
or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity,
practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or
transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, each of the other Parties shall, and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with such Party or its counsel in
the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably requested
in connection with such contest or defense, including entering into a joint
defense agreement or confidentiality agreement with respect thereto, all at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (except to the
extent that the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor pursuant to Article IX below).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.7 Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

(a) Each Party and the Members' Representative agrees to use all reasonable
efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries to take, all actions and do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to (i)
obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all filings with and give
all notices to Governmental Authorities or any other public or private third
parties required to consummate the Equity Transfer and the other matters
contemplated hereby, (ii) provide such other information and communications to
such Governmental Authorities or other public or private Persons as the other
Party or such Governmental Authorities or other public or private Persons may
reasonably request in connection therewith, and (iii) consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of all
conditions hereto; provided that the foregoing shall not require acceptance by
the Buyer or the Seller Parties of any mitigation arrangement or any condition
required or imposed on the Buyer, the Buyer's Affiliates, the Members and/or
the Company or its Subsidiaries that are unacceptable to the Buyer or the
Members' Representative, each in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.7(a), Parent and the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Seller Parties, on the other hand, (i) shall each keep the other Party
reasonably and promptly informed of any and all material written and oral
communications from any Governmental Authority, or any such other public or
private Person, regarding the Extension and the Extension Documents and
regarding the Transactions or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents.

  

  

(b) Each of the Parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other in
connection with the performance of Section 6.7(a), and to the extent
reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law and the applicable
Governmental Authority, all discussions, telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions shall include
representatives of the Company and the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly understood and
agreed that (i) no Party shall have any obligation to litigate or contest any
administrative or judicial action or any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent brought by or before an
administrative tribunal, court or other similar tribunal or body and (ii)
nothing shall require the Buyer or any Seller Party to accept or permit any
Subsidiary of the Company to accept, without the Buyer's and the Members'
Representative's consent, any requirement, condition or arrangement imposed
upon the Members, the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective business operations as a condition to obtaining approval or
resolving any objection of a Governmental Authority or other public or private
Persons with respect to the Transactions, in each case to the extent that such
actions, requirements, conditions or arrangements are unacceptable to the
Buyer or the Members' Representative, each in its sole discretion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Parties and the Members' Representative shall make all other necessary
and appropriate filings with applicable agencies of the U.S. Government,
including submission of notification of the Transactions to the U.S.
Department of State at least sixty (60) days in advance of the Closing
pursuant to 22 C.F.R. § 122.4(b).

  

  

(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 6.7(a)-(c) above, none of the Parties
shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the
obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of any Governmental
Authority.

  

  

(e) Promptly following the date hereof, the Executive Employees and the Buyer
shall each negotiate the Employment Agreements in good faith consistent with
the terms set forth in Section 7.6(i).

  

  

6.8 Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

6.9 Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. Prior to the closing of the Warrant Tender Offer,
Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act entered into by Parent or
a subsidiary of Parent (including the Buyer and the Company and its
Subsidiaries) with any officer, director or employee pursuant to which
consideration is payable to such officer, director or employee to be approved
in accordance with the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth
in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

  

  

6.10 Payment of Obligations. Prior to the Closing, each of the Members and
their respective Affiliates and each of the officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall repay in full, in
accordance with their terms, all debts and other obligations, if any, owed to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case other than
as set forth on Schedule 6.10.

  

  

6.11 No Solicitation; No Trading.

  

  

(a) No Seller Party shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, and each Seller Party shall cause its Representatives not to, solicit or
encourage the initiation or submission of interest, offers, inquiries or
proposals (or consider or entertain any of the foregoing) from any Person
(including by way of providing any non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries, their businesses or assets to any Person or
otherwise), initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions, or
enter into, accept or authorize any agreement or agreement in principle, or
announce any intention to do any of the foregoing, with respect to any
expression of interest, offer, proposal to acquire, purchase, license or lease
(i) all or a substantial portion of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
business or assets, or (ii) the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
membership interest or other equity securities, in each case whether by equity
purchase, merger, consolidation, combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, purchase of assets, tender offer, lease, license or
otherwise (any of the foregoing, a "Seller Competing Transaction"). Each
Seller Party shall, and each Seller Party shall cause its Representatives to,
immediately discontinue any ongoing discussions or negotiations (other than
any ongoing discussions with the Buyer) relating to a possible Seller
Competing Transaction, and shall promptly provide the Buyer with an oral or a
written notice of any expression of interest, proposal or offer relating to a
possible Seller Competing Transaction that is received by such Seller Party,
any Subsidiaries of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company or the
knowledge of any Member, any of their respective Representatives from any
Person, which notice shall contain the nature of the proposal and the material
terms of the proposal. Each Seller Party represents and warrants to the Buyer
that this Section 6.11(a) does not and will not conflict with or violate any
agreement, understanding or arrangement, whether written or oral, to which any
Seller Party, its Affiliates or the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
officers, employees, agents or Affiliates are currently bound.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) Neither Parent nor the Buyer shall, and each shall cause its
Representatives not to, make or initiate any submission of interest, offer,
inquiry or proposal (or consider or entertain any of the foregoing) to any
Person, initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions or commence
or conduct any due diligence investigation, or enter into, accept or authorize
any agreement or agreement in principle, or announce any intention to do any
of the foregoing, with respect to the acquisition, purchase, license or lease
by Parent or the Buyer of (i) all or a substantial portion of the business or
assets of any Person, or (ii) the membership interests, capital stock or other
equity securities of any Person, in each case whether by equity purchase,
merger, consolidation, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, purchase
of assets, tender offer, lease, license or otherwise and in each case intended
by Parent to be an alternative to the Transactions (any of the foregoing, a
"Parent Competing Transaction"). Parent and the Buyer shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, immediately discontinue any ongoing
discussions or negotiations (other than any ongoing discussions with the
Selling Parties) relating to a possible Parent Competing Transaction, and
shall promptly provide the Members' Representative with an oral or written
notice of any expression of interest, proposal or offer relating to a possible
Parent Competing Transaction that is received by Parent, the Buyer or, to the
knowledge of Parent or the Buyer, any of their respective Representatives from
any Person, which notice shall contain the nature of the proposal and the
material terms of the proposal. Parent and the Buyer each represent and
warrant to the Selling Parties that this Section 6.11(b) does not and will not
conflict with or violate any agreement, understanding or arrangement, whether
written or oral, to which Parent, the Buyer or any of their officers,
employees, or agents is currently bound. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the foregoing prohibitions shall not apply to (i)
any activities taken by or on behalf of The Chart Group, L.P., Cowen Overseas
Investment LP or any of their Affiliates that are not on behalf of or with
respect to Parent or the Buyer or (ii) any activities taken by or on behalf of
Parent or the Buyer in connection with any transaction that would be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, the Transactions and with respect to which
neither Parent nor the Buyer has incurred, or become obligated to incur or
reimburse, any cost or expense.

  

  

(c) Each of the Seller Parties acknowledges and agrees that each is aware, and
that the Subsidiaries of the Company are aware, (and each of their respective
Representatives is aware or, upon receipt of any material nonpublic
information of the Buyer, will be advised) of the restrictions imposed by the
United States federal securities Laws and other applicable foreign and
domestic Laws on a Person possessing material nonpublic information about a
public company. The Members' Representative and each of the Seller Parties
hereby agrees that, while any of them are in possession of such material
nonpublic information, none of such Person or Persons shall purchase or sell
any securities of Parent, communicate such information to any third party,
take any other action with respect to Parent in violation of such Laws, or
cause or encourage any third party to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.12 Security Clearances. The Seller Parties (i) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each of DSS and any other Governmental
Authority responsible for the maintenance of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' facility security clearances shall not terminate, suspend,
revoke or in any way materially change either the Government Contracts with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
facility security clearance with respect to such Government Contracts as a
result of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii)
from the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, shall continue to
take any and all requisite steps to cause each of the Seller Parties (as
applicable) to retain the requisite facility and personnel security clearances
to own and operate the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any successor
thereto) and its business as currently conducted without delay or
interruption.

  

  

6.13 Proxy Statements; Special Meetings.

  

  

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after receipt by Parent from the
Company of all financial and other information relating to the Company as
Parent may reasonably request for its preparation, Parent shall prepare with
the assistance of the Company and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act,
and with all other applicable regulatory bodies, materials in the form of a
proxy statement to be used for the purpose of soliciting proxies (the "Proxy
Solicitation") from holders of Parent Common Stock for the matters to be acted
upon at the Special Meeting and providing such holders an opportunity to have
their shares of Parent Common Stock redeemed (the "Redemption Offer") in
conjunction with the stockholder vote on the Required Approval Matters (the
"Proxy Statement"). The Proxy Statement shall include proxy materials for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock to vote, at
a meeting of holders of Parent Common Stock to be called and held for such

Agreement and the Transactions, (ii) an amendment and restatement of Parent's

acceptable to the Members' Representative, for the benefit of the Company's
employees (including its executive officers) and non-employee directors, to
become effective upon the Closing and providing for the issuance of up to 7.5%
of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock and Class B Parent
Shares issued and outstanding immediately after the Closing, giving effect to
any stockholder redemptions occurring prior to or concurrently with the
Closing and the payment of the Per Company Unit Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.2(c), (iv) such other matters as the Parties shall hereafter
mutually determine to be necessary or appropriate in order to effect the
Transactions, (the approvals described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this
Section 6.13(a), collectively the "Required Approval Matters"), and (v) the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the
reasonable determination of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Voting
Matters"). Parent, with the assistance of the Company, shall promptly respond
to any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be approved by the SEC for
mailing to the holders of Parent Common Stock as promptly as practicable.
Parent shall also take any and all actions required to satisfy the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, Parent shall prepare with the
assistance of the Company and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and
with all other applicable regulatory bodies, materials in the form of a proxy
statement to be used for the purpose of soliciting proxies (the "Extension
Proxy Solicitation") from the holders of Parent Common Stock to approve, at a
Special Meeting (the "Extension Special Meeting"), an amendment to Parent's
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the deadline for
Parent to consummate its initial business combination (and, if applicable,
each amendment set forth therein) (the "Extension"), and providing such
holders with a Redemption Offer in connection witherewith (the "Extension
Proxy Statement"). Parent, with the assistance of the Company, shall promptly
respond to any SEC comments on the Extension Proxy Statement and shall
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the Extension Proxy Statement
to be approved by the SEC for mailing to the holders of Parent Common Stock as
promptly as practicable. Parent shall also take any and all actions required
to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

  

  

(c) Parent shall also take any and all actions required to satisfy the
requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in connection
therewith. Parent and the Company shall each promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Extension Proxy Statement and the Proxy
Statement (and other related materials) if and to the extent that such
information is determined to have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Laws. Parent shall amend or
supplement the Extension Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement and cause the
Proxy Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
to be disseminated to the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and Parent's Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws. Parent shall provide the Seller Parties with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any material oral
comments, that Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Representatives
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Extension Proxy
Solicitation, the Proxy Solicitation or Redemption Offer promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall give the Seller Parties a reasonable
opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed
written or material oral responses to such comments.

  

  

(d) As soon as practicable following approval by the SEC, Parent shall
distribute the Extension Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement to the
holders of Parent Common Stock and, pursuant thereto, shall call the
applicable Special Meeting in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as amended (the "DGCL") for a date no later than thirty (30) days
following the approval of the Extension Proxy Statement or the Proxy Statement
by the SEC. Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in

cash at a purchase price of $0.60 subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Appendix B. The Warrant Offerors have deposited an
aggregate of $2,250,000 with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company into a

Offerors all information concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries and Parent,

Documents and shall otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the SEC review process as promptly as practicable. The Warrant Offerors shall
promptly distribute the completed Warrant Tender Offer Documents to the
holders of the Parent Warrants and, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement and applicable Laws and SEC regulations, purchase the Parent
Warrants validly tendered pursuant to the Warrant Tender Offer. The Warrant
Offerors may, to the extent permitted by the applicable tender offer rules
promulgated by the SEC (the "Tender Offer Rules"), extend the Warrant Tender
Offer from time to time to a date no later than the then anticipated Closing
Date.

  

  

(b) On the date the Warrant Offerors file the Schedule TO with the SEC or as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, Parent shall (i) file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") and (ii)
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws. The Company, Parent and the
Warrant Offerors will correct promptly any information provided by any of them
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading, and
Parent will take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Parent
Warrants, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.
Parent shall give the Seller Parties, the Warrant Offerors and their
respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their
filing with the SEC. In addition, Parent shall provide the Seller Parties, the
Warrant Offerors and their respective counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. The Seller Parties, the Warrant Offerors and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses and Parent shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company, the Warrant Offerors
and their respective counsel.

proxy statement filed by Parent or the Warrant Offerors with the SEC
(including the Public Disclosure Documents), the Company shall cause the
applicable Required Financial Statements to be prepared and delivered to
Parent and the Warrant Offerors and shall cause each accounting firm auditing
the same to provide its consent to the use of such firm's audit report in

(b) The Parties, Parent and the Warrant Offerors shall comply in all material
respects with the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws, including the
Tender Offer Rules, in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Public
Disclosure Documents, the conduct of the Proxy Solicitation, the conduct of
the Warrant Tender Offer and the purchase of the Parent Warrants under the
Warrant Tender Offer. The Parties, Parent and the Warrant Offerors shall
ensure that the Public Disclosure Documents (i) do not, as of the date that
they are first distributed to holders of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Warrants, as applicable, and as of the date of the Special Meeting or the
closing of the Warrant Tender Offer, as applicable, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (ii) contain substantially the same
financial and other information about Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries
as is required under Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act
regulating the solicitation of proxies even if such information is not
required under the Tender Offer Rules.

  

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion of the Public
Disclosure Documents will include disclosures regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses, management, operations and financial
condition. Accordingly, the Company agrees to (i) provide, as promptly as
practicable, Parent and the Warrant Offerors with such information as shall be
reasonably requested by Parent and the Warrant Offerors for inclusion in or
attachment to the applicable Public Disclosure Document to be filed and/or
mailed as of and following the commencement of the Proxy Solicitation or
Warrant Tender Offer and (ii) ensure that such information is accurate in all
material respects, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The Company understands that such information shall be included in the Public
Disclosure Documents and/or responses to comments from the SEC or its staff in
connection therewith. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make its directors, officers and employees available to
Parent, the Warrant Offerors and their respective counsel in connection with
the drafting of such filings and mailings and responding in a timely manner to
comments from the SEC.

after the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the release of the guaranties by any Member or any Related Person of

equivalent organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses shall not
be amended or altered. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall

legal or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation incurred in connection therewith).

modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.18 applies without the consent of such DandO Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.18 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.18

books, records or other documents destroyed at the direction of any Member.

6.24 Disclosure Schedule Update. Within two (2) Business Days of items (i) and

For twelve (12) Business Days following such completion, the Company shall
have the right to deliver to the Buyer a supplement to the Company Schedules,
which supplement may only contain information obtained in connection with the
preparation of the Required Financial Statements and may not relate to any
matter resulting from a Willful Breach by a Seller Party. If the Company
delivers such a supplement to the Buyer (the date of such delivery, the
"Company Schedule Update Date"), the Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such supplement in which to (i) notify the Company in
writing that the Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement (with the failure of
the Buyer to deliver such a notification deemed to be an election by Buyer not
to terminate this Agreement) and (ii) if Buyer does not elect to terminate
this Agreement, either to waive any or all of the matters disclosed in such
supplement or notify the Company in writing that the Buyer refuses to waive
any or all of such matters (with the failure of the Buyer to deliver such a
notification deemed to be an election by Buyer to waive all such matters). If
the Buyer waives any of such matters, the applicable representations and
warranties of the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement
to be qualified by the matters so waived. If the Buyer notifies the Company in
writing that it refuses to waive any or all of such matters, the Company shall
have the right, for five (5) Business Days following receipt of such notice,
to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Buyer (with the failure
of the Company to deliver such a notification of termination deemed to
constitute the Company's agreement that the matters which Buyer has refused to
waive shall not for any purpose of this Agreement be deemed to qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if (x) Buyer does not elect to terminate this
Agreement and (y) Buyer waives any such matters relating to the
representations and warranties made in Section 3.5(a) as contemplated by the
foregoing (including by failure to elect to terminate this Agreement or to
waive such matters during the applicable five (5) Business Day period), then
the representations and warranties made in Section 3.5(a) shall be deemed to
have expired for all purposes under this Agreement.

Schedule 1.1 thereof in accordance with Section 6.7.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63

Parties shall cause the names of each Excluded Entity to be amended as

(a) No later than August 15, 2014, the Seller Parties shall cause the 351
Exposure Statement to be prepared and delivered to Parent.

  

  

(b) Unless an UP-C Notice is delivered or deemed delivered, prior to the
Closing, the Buyer shall file a Form 8832 (Entity Classification Election) and
any corresponding state and local income tax forms so that, on the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall be treated as an association taxable as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, if applicable, state and local
income tax purposes.

  

  

(c) If an UP-C Notice is delivered or deemed delivered, then (i) from and
after the Closing Date the Buyer shall elect to be treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, if applicable, state and local
income tax purposes, (ii) the Parties will negotiate in good faith an
amendment to the form of the Buyer LLC Agreement to give effect to the
foregoing clause (i), including tax distribution provisions based on pro rata
distributions to each of the members of the Buyer and the ability or inability
of Parent to distribute and/or reinvest in the Buyer any excess tax
distributions received by it, and (iii) the Parties will discuss in good faith
whether to include a tax receivable agreement and, if applicable, negotiate
the terms thereof in good faith.

  

  

6.28 Offer Letter. Prior to August 15, 2014, that certain Offer Letter by and
between R. Lee Priest and Tempus Jets dated as of March 10, 2014 shall have
been amended in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent to provide that (in
lieu of the matters contemplated by the section thereof entitled "Investment")
at the Closing Parent shall make a restricted stock grant to R. Lee Priest of
100,000 shares Parent Common Stock subject to 4-year annual cliff vesting (25%
per year on the anniversary of such grant). For avoidance of doubt, if the
Parent Board does not approve any such amendment reasonably agreed to between
R. Lee Priest and the Company, the Seller Parties shall not be deemed to be in
breach of this covenant.

agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Parent, the Buyer and
their respective officers, directors, employees, members, assigns, successors

9.2 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any
Proceeding (whether against an Indemnified Party or against any other Person)
with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such Proceeding on
its own (subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 9.2(a)). The
election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim shall constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party, as between it and
the Indemnified Party, of the right to dispute the obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in connection therewith, subject to the limitations set
forth herein. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim the defense of which has been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party and to employ counsel separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Party, it being agreed, subject to the following sentence,
that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense and shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) the named
parties (including any impleaded parties) to a Proceeding in connection
therewith include both the Indemnified Party (or any of its Related Persons)
and the Indemnifying Party (or any of its Related Persons) and the Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes, in consultation with counsel, that there is a
conflict of interest between it and the Indemnifying Party (or any of its
Related Persons), (iii) such Third Party Claim involves a charge of criminal
liability, (iv) the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that the
Damages which are reasonably likely to be incurred as a result of such Third
Party Claim would exceed the remaining amount available under the limitation
set forth in Section 9.4(b), (v) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to
or in lieu of monetary damages, specific performance or any injunctive or
other equitable relief; (vi) the Third Party Claim directly involves a
material customer or supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Governmental Authority, (vii) an insurance carrier requires, as a condition to
an Indemnified Party's eligibility to recover insurance proceeds on account of
such Third Party Claim, that such carrier control the defense of such Third
Party Claim (and such defense is controlled by such carrier), (viii) the
Indemnifying Party is not reasonably, diligently and in good faith conducting
a defense of the Third Party Claim or (ix) if the Indemnified Parties include
a Buyer Indemnified Party, the Third Party Claim involves a Proceeding
contemplated by Section 6.5(e) to be controlled by Parent; then, in any such
case, following written notice to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one separate counsel
(together with one local counsel) selected by the Indemnified Party to
represent the Indemnified Party in connection therewith.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not effect, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third
Party Claim unless the same (x) involves an unconditional release of all
claims against the Indemnified Party in form and substance satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, (y) is limited to the payment of monetary damages by the
Indemnifying Party and (z) does not include any statement or admission as to
fault, culpability, or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party effects any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, the amount of such settlement or compromise shall not be
determinative of any Damages payable by the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in the review, investigation and defense of any such claim, and shall,
upon reasonable prior written notice and during normal business hours, in a
manner so as not to unreasonably interfere in any material respect with normal
business operations, make available its personnel, and provide such access to
its books and records as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnified Party, as applicable, in connection therewith.

  

  

(d) In the event that any Indemnified Party desires to seek indemnification
under this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, which shall state the basis for such
indemnification claim and, to the extent known or reasonably calculable, an
estimate and calculation of the amount of Damages resulting therefrom;
provided, however, that any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the obligations of any of
the Indemnifying Party or any of the rights of any Indemnified Party, under
this Article IX (except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
failure adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying
Party disputes a claim for indemnification or any portion thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing (which
writing shall set forth the grounds for such objection) within ten (10)
Business Days after its receipt of notice of such claim for indemnification,
whereupon the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall meet and attempt
in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim or any
portion of such claim for indemnification. If the dispute has not been
resolved within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Party's notice of such
dispute, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may proceed
with pursuing the remedies provided herein to resolve such dispute. In the
event that no written notice disputing or objecting to such claim or any
portion of such claim for indemnification is delivered by the Indemnifying
Party prior to the expiration of the ten (10) Business Days in which the
Indemnifying Party may dispute such claim for indemnification, the claim(s)
stated by the Indemnified Party shall be conclusively deemed to be approved by
the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(e) All Damages indemnifiable hereunder shall be payable by the Indemnifying
Party to the Company in cash; provided, that, (A) if the Specified Members are
the Indemnifying Party, then at the election of the Indemnifying Party by
written notice to the Indemnified Party, the amount of any Damages
indemnifiable under Section 9.1(b)(i), 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(b)(iv) and 9.1(b)(v),
as applicable, (excluding any Damages resulting from a Willful Breach) may be
satisfied by adjusting the Schedule of Members (as defined in the Buyer LLC
Agreement) to reflect the cancellation of the number of Buyer Units held by
the Specified Members, and (B) if Parent and the Buyer are the Indemnifying
Party, then in all cases the amount of any Damages indemnifiable under Section
9.1(a), shall be satisfied by adjusting the Schedule of Members (as defined in
the Buyer LLC Agreement) to reflect the issuance of the number of Buyer Units
to the Specified Members, in each case representing the right to convert into
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock that, when valued at the VWAP, has a
value equal to the amount of such indemnifiable Damages, and, in accordance
with Article IV of the Third Amended and Restated Parent Certificate and the
Buyer LLC Agreement, Parent shall cancel Class B Parent Shares held by the
Specified Members or issue Class B Parent Shares to the Specified Members, as
applicable (and Parent shall cancel and/or issue certificates representing
such Class B Parent Shares as needed to evidence such issuances or
cancellations of such Class B Parent Shares), such that the number of Class B
Parent Shares held by a Member at all times equals the number of Buyer Units
held by such Member.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no exercise of, nor
failure to exercise, the rights set forth in this Section 9.2 shall constitute
an election of remedies or limit such Indemnified Party's other rights
hereunder or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) the aggregate liability of a Specified Member under, or related
to, this Agreement shall in no event exceed such Specified Member's Pro Rata
Percentage of the Base Company Value, (ii) except with respect to a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by a Specified Member in
Article IV or a failure of such Specified Member to perform a covenant or
agreement applicable to such Specified Member, no Specified Member shall have
any liability in excess of his, her or its Pro Rata Percentage of any Damages
recoverable under Section 9.1(b), and (iii) no Specified Member shall have any
liability for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
by any other Specified Member in Article IV or a failure of any other
Specified Member to perform a covenant or agreement applicable to such other
Specified Member. The term "Pro Rata Percentage" means with respect to each
Specified Member, the proportion of the number of issued and outstanding
Company Units held by such Specified Member immediately prior to the Closing
as compared to the total number of Company Units held by all Specified Members
immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this Section 9.2(f) shall prevent
or prohibit a Party from seeking and/or obtaining specific performance or any
other equitable remedy in accordance with Section 12.3. Any cash payment
required under this Section shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by the payee.

  

  

9.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each covenant and
agreement contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Closing and be enforceable until such
covenant or agreement has been fully performed. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and shall thereafter expire. The
limitations on survival set forth in this Section 9.3 shall not apply to (a)
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(a) (Organization
and Corporate Power), 3.2 (Authority for Agreement), 3.3 (No Violation to
Result), 3.4 (Capitalization), 3.10 (Taxes), 3.26 (Brokers), 4.1 (Authority

Result), 5.5 (Capitalization), and 5.13 (Taxes), all of which shall survive
until sixty (60) days after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.16
(Anti-Corruption Laws; Certain Regulatory Matters), which shall survive until
the date six (6) years from the Closing Date, (c) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.8 (Employee Benefit Plans), Section 3.14
(Government Contracts and Bids) and Section 3.18 (Environmental and Safety
Matters), which shall survive until the date three (3) years from the Closing
Date or (d) claims based on criminal matters, fraud or Willful Breach, which
shall survive without limitation. No claim may be made for indemnification
hereunder for breach of any representations, warranties or covenants after the
expiration of the survival period applicable to such representation, warranty
and covenant set forth above; provided that, any representation, warranty or
covenant with respect to which a claim has been made for a breach thereon
prior to any of the foregoing dates shall, only with respect to such claim,
survive until such claim is resolved.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) An Indemnifying Party shall have no liability to indemnify for Damages
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) or 9.1(b)(i), as applicable, unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Damages for all claims asserted by the Indemnified
Party exceeds Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000) (the "Deductible");
provided, however, that after the amount of such Damages exceeds the
Deductible, all such Damages in excess of the Deductible shall, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this Article IX, be recoverable by the
Indemnified Parties; provided, further, that the foregoing limitations shall
not apply to (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.1(a) (Organization and Corporate Power), 3.2 (Authority for Agreement), 3.3
(No Violation to Result), 3.4 (Capitalization), 3.10 (Taxes), 4.1 (Authority
for Agreement), 4.2 (No Violation to Result), 4.3 (Ownership), 5.1
(Organization), 5.2 (Authority for Agreement), 5.3 (No Violation to Result),
5.5 (Capitalization), 5.6 (Listing), 5.7 (Trust Fund) and 5.13 (Taxes) or (ii)
claims based on fraud or Willful Breach, with respect to which, in each case,
all Damages in connection therewith shall be recoverable from the first dollar
and shall be counted in determining whether the thresholds in this Section
9.4(a) have been exceeded. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Damages with respect to (but not for purposes of determining the existence of)
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant for purposes of
indemnification under this Article IX, any qualification or limitation of a
representation, warranty or covenant by reference to materiality of matters
stated therein or as to matters having or not having "Material Adverse
Effect," "materiality" or words of similar effect, shall be disregarded.

  

  

(b) The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)(i) or 9.1(b)(i), as applicable, shall be limited to an amount
equal to 15% of the Base Company Value (the "Cap"); provided (i) that to the
extent that any Damages indemnifiable under Section 9.1(b)(i) with respect to
the breach of Section 3.14 (Government Contracts and Bids) are otherwise
precluded by the Cap, such Damages, up to an aggregate amount equal to 50% of
the Base Company Value (which for avoidance of doubt shall include and not be
in addition to the amount of the Cap that would otherwise be applicable),
shall not be so limited by this sentence, and (ii) that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.1(a) (Organization and Corporate Power), 3.2 (Authority for
Agreement), 3.3 (No Violation to Result), 3.4 (Capitalization), 3.10 (Taxes),
4.1 (Authority for Agreement), 4.2 (No Violation to Result), 4.3 (Ownership),
5.1 (Organization), 5.2 (Authority for Agreement), 5.3 (No Violation to
Result), 5.5 (Capitalization), 5.6 (Listing), 5.7 (Trust Fund) and 5.13
(Taxes), which shall be limited to an amount equal to the Base Company Value,
or (iii) claims based on fraud or Willful Breach, which shall not be limited
in amount.

  

  

(c) Except with respect to claims based on fraud or willful misconduct or
actions seeking specific performance, the indemnification obligations of the
Parties pursuant to this Article IX shall be the Parties', any other Seller
Indemnified Parties' and any other Buyer Indemnified Parties' sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any claim related to or arising from this
Agreement, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the performance by
the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.5 Mitigation, etc.

  

  

(a) The Indemnified Party shall, and is obligated to, take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate all indemnifiable Damages upon and after becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Damages hereunder, and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to
seek recovery under all available insurance policies covering any Damages for
which such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification; provided, however,
that that exhaustion of all such efforts by the Indemnified Party shall not be
a precondition to recovery of Damages by such Indemnified Party in accordance
with this Article IX; provided, further, that if the Indemnified Party is a
Buyer Indemnified Party, then such Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be liable
for any failure to comply with its obligations under this sentence to the
extent that the Members (A) act to prevent or materially impede Parent or the
Buyer, as applicable, from complying, or (B) who are officers of Parent or
Buyer, fail to take the steps reasonably required hereunder to mitigate such
damages unless otherwise instructed by the Parent Board or such steps are not
within their scope of authority. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX
to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other Buyer Indemnified Party be obligated to seek
indemnification or otherwise recover any amounts from (nor shall the Members
be subrogated to the rights of Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any other Buyer Indemnified Party) a material customer or supplier of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Indemnified Party shall be obligated to
commence or threaten to commence a Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.5
unless the Indemnifying Party (i) shall have reasonably requested in writing
that the Indemnified Party commence such Proceeding, (ii) acknowledges in
writing that it is liable for all costs and expenses of such Proceeding and
(iii) pays all such costs and expenses as and when incurred in connection with
pursuing such Proceeding; it being acknowledged and agreed that, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to pay all such costs and expenses as and when
incurred, the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to continue to pursue
such Proceeding.

  

  

(b) The amount of any Damages indemnifiable under this Article IX shall be net
of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies, third party indemnities or other collateral sources with respect to
such Damages. In the event any amounts recovered from such sources are not
received before a claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to this Article
IX then the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to reimburse the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, on a pro rata basis, for any
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)
expended by them in pursuing such recovery or defending any claims arising
therefrom, second, to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Party which
would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such
payment (taking into account the first sentence of this Section 9.5(b)) and,
third, any excess to the Indemnified Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The amount of Damages with respect to which an Indemnified Party is to be
indemnified pursuant to this Agreement shall initially be determined without
regard to any Tax benefit or Tax detriment, and the indemnification payment
shall be made on such basis. To the extent, however, that the Indemnified
Party recognizes a Tax benefit or Tax detriment with respect to any Damages
for which payment is made hereunder, after taking into account the Tax effect,
if any, of such indemnification (the "Net Tax Effect"), the Indemnified Party
(in the case of a Tax benefit) or the Indemnifying Party (in the case of a Tax
detriment) shall pay to the Indemnifying Party (in the case of a Tax benefit)
or the Indemnified Party (in the case of a Tax detriment) the amount of such
Net Tax Effect at such time or times as and to the extent such Indemnified
Party or Indemnifying Party, as applicable, or any of their Affiliates
realizes such Net Tax Effect through a refund, reduction or increase in Tax
otherwise payable, calculated by computing the amount of Tax with and without
taking into account any Tax items attributable to such Damages and the
indemnification payment with respect to such Damages.

  

  

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement
or similar right against any Person with respect to such Indemnifying Party's
obligations under this Agreement. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives all
such rights, and agrees not to institute any Proceedings against any other
Person with respect to the same.

  

  

9.6 Waiver, Release and Discharge. Effective as of the Closing, except for any
rights, obligations or claims arising under any Transaction Document, each of
the Members, in each case for itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably
waives, releases and discharges (i) Parent, the Buyer and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers and employees (determined in each case prior
to the consummation of the Transaction) and (ii) the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their employees (other than the Members) from any and all Liabilities and
obligations to such Member of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as a
member, option holder, officer, director or Company Employee or otherwise
(including in respect of rights of contribution or indemnification), in each
case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown at law or equity, or otherwise and which are based on acts, events or
omissions occurring up to and including the Closing; provided, however, that
the Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 9.6 does not apply to, and
shall not constitute a waiver, release or discharge of, (i) to the extent that
such releasing party is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
such releasing party's right to any salary or wages, and entitlements to
employee expense reimbursements and contributions to Benefit Plans, in each
case to the extent accrued, earned or otherwise due to such releasing Party
prior to the Closing and (ii) the releasing party's or its Affiliates' rights
in connection with any matter listed on Schedule 7.6(d)(ii) or Schedule 6.10.

  

  

9.7 Members' Representative.

  

  

(a) Each of the Members designates Benjamin Scott Terry and John G. Gulbin III
as such Member's representative (acting together, or either of them acting
individually, the "Members' Representative") for purposes of this Agreement,
and Benjamin Scott Terry and John G. Gulbin III each agrees to act as the
Members' Representative as set forth herein. Each of the Members and each of
their respective successors shall be deemed to have approved, and shall be
bound by, any and all actions taken by the Members' Representative on their
behalf under or otherwise relating to this Agreement and the Transactions as
if such actions were expressly ratified and confirmed by each of them. In the
event that the Members' Representative is unable or unwilling to serve or
shall resign, a successor Members' Representative shall be selected by the
holders of a majority of the Acquired Units outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing. A Members' Representative may not resign, except upon thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to the Buyer. In the event of a notice of proposed
resignation, or any death, disability or other replacement of a Members'
Representative, a successor, if needed, shall be appointed effective
immediately thereafter, and the Buyer shall be notified promptly of such
appointment by such successor Members' Representative. No resignation, nor any
other replacement, of any Members' Representative is effective against the
Buyer until selection of a successor and prior written notice to the Buyer of
such selection. Each successor Members' Representative shall have all of the
power, rights, authority and privileges hereby conferred upon the original
Members' Representative.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any communication or writing
given or executed by the Members' Representative on behalf of the Members. All
communications or writings to be sent to the Members pursuant to this
Agreement may be addressed to the Members' Representative and any
communication or writing so sent shall be deemed notice to all of the Members
hereunder. Each Member hereby consents and agrees that the Members'
Representative is authorized to accept deliveries, including any notice, on
behalf of each Member pursuant hereto.

  

  

(c) The Members' Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the true
and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Member with full power of substitution in
such Member's name and on such Member's behalf to act according to the terms
of the Transaction Documents in the absolute discretion of the Members'
Representative; and in general to do all things and to perform all acts
including executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts,
instructions, notices and other instruments contemplated by or deemed
advisable in connection with this Agreement, including this Article IX and the
other Transaction Documents. This power of attorney and all authority hereby
conferred is granted subject to the interest of the other Members hereunder
and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements made herein, and
shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Member, by
operation of Law, by such Member's death or disability, or by any other event.

  

  

(d) The Members' Representative shall not have any liability to any of the
Members for any act done or omitted hereunder or otherwise in connection with
the performance of its duties under this Section 9.7 as the Members'
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment. The Members' Representative shall be indemnified by the Members for
and shall be held harmless against any loss, liability or expense (including
any out-of-pocket costs, legal fees and other legal costs) incurred by the
Members' Representative or any of its Affiliates and any of their respective
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling
persons, in each case, relating to the Members' Representative's conduct as
Members' Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses that have
been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to result from
the Members' Representative's fraud in connection with its performance under
this Section 9.7. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. The Members' Representative may, in all questions arising under
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, rely on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts it reasonably
determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to
any of the Parties hereto or to the Members for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Members' Representative in accordance with such
advice. In no event shall the Members' Representative be liable hereunder or
under any other Transaction Document for any indirect, punitive, special or
consequential damages.

(a) This Agreement may, by notice given on or prior to the Closing, in the

the Closing, as follows:

  

  

(i) by the Members' Representative if there has been a misrepresentation,
default or breach by Parent or the Buyer with respect any or their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in
any Transaction Document which would result in any of the conditions to the

such misrepresentation, default or breach;

  

  

(ii) by the Buyer if there has been a misrepresentation, default or breach by

warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any Transaction

misrepresentation, default or breach either (i) is the result of a Willful
Breach or (ii) shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt

misrepresentation, default or breach;

  

  

(iii) by mutual written agreement of the Members' Representative and the

not have occurred on or before the one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the
delivery to Parent of the Required Financial Statements; provided, however,
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not because of its
(and in the case of the Members' Representative, the Company's or any
Member's, and in the case of the Buyer, Parent's) breach or violation of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein have caused the Closing
not to have occurred;

Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and such effect, event or
change is continuing at the time of such termination, or (b) if by the
ninetieth (90th) day following the date hereof the Required Financial
Statements have not been delivered to Parent or the Reorganization has not
been consummated;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vii) by the Members' Representative, on the one hand, or by the Buyer, on the
other hand, if there shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or
state court in effect preventing the consummation of the Transactions; or
there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Transactions by any
Governmental Authority that would make the consummation of the transactions

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(a), (i) the Equity Transfer shall be abandoned; (ii) the provisions of
Sections 6.3(b) and (c), Section 9.7, this Article X and Article XI and

obligations under this Agreement after its termination in the absence of fraud
or Willful Breach of this Agreement by such Party.

  

  

ARTICLE XI

  

  

TRUST FUND WAIVER

  

  

11.1 Trust Fund Waiver. Reference is made to the final prospectus of Parent
dated December 13, 2012 (File No. 333-177280) (the "Prospectus"). Each of the
Seller Parties warrants and represents, jointly and severally, that such
Seller Party has read the Prospectus and understands that Parent has
established the Trust Fund containing the proceeds of the IPO initially in the
amount of at least Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) for the benefit
of Parent's public stockholders and certain other parties (including the
underwriters of the IPO) and that Parent may disburse monies from the Trust
Fund, including any proceeds therefrom, only as provided in the Prospectus.
For and in consideration of Parent agreeing to enter into this Agreement, each
of the Seller Parties agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions contained in
this Agreement, such Seller Party does not now have, and shall not at any time
prior to the Closing have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust
Fund or any asset contained therein, regardless of whether such claim arises
as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the business
relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, this Agreement or any other agreement or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. Each of the Seller
Parties (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and direct and indirect
subsidiaries and members, and its and their respective successors and assigns,
and any Person claiming by or through such Seller Party) hereby irrevocably
waives any and all rights, titles, interests and claims of any kind that such
Seller Party may have, now or in the future (in each case, however, prior to
the consummation of a business combination), and shall not take any action or
suit, make any claim or demand or seek recovery of any Liability or recourse
against, the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof. Each of
the Seller Parties agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is
material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it
to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Seller Parties further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable
Law. To the extent that any of the Seller Parties or the Members'
Representative commences any action or Proceeding based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Parent, which
Proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against Parent, each of
the Seller Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees such Seller Party's sole
remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Fund and that such
claim shall not permit such Seller Party (or any party claiming on such Seller
Party's behalf or in lieu of such Seller Party) to have any claim against the
Trust Fund or any amounts contained therein. In the event that any Seller
Party or the Members' Representative commences any action or Proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
Parent, which Proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust
Fund or Parent's public stockholders, whether in the form of money damages or
injunctive relief, Parent shall be entitled to recover from such Seller Party
or the Members' Representative, as applicable, the associated legal fees and
costs in connection with any such action, in the event Parent prevails in such
action or Proceeding.

ARTICLE XII

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

12.1 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Seller Parties and their respective successors and
assigns; provided, however, that no Party may make any assignment of this
Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Buyer and the Members' Representative. Any such purported assignment without
such prior written consent shall be void and of no force or effect.

  

  

12.2 Governing Law. All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall in all respects
be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

  

  

12.3 Specific Performance; Remedies.

  

  

(a) Each Party acknowledges that the other Parties shall be irreparably harmed
and that there shall be no adequate remedy at Law for any violation or breach,
or threatened breach, by any of them of any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, and that any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by a Party hereto, including such Party's failure to take all
actions as are necessary on such Party's part in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to consummate the Transactions, would not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. It is accordingly agreed,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, that,
subject to Section 12.3(b), in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other
remedies that may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or
agreements (including monetary Damages), each Party shall have the right to
obtain injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of, the other Parties' covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement. Each Party hereby agrees (i) to waive
the defense in any such suit that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at
law, (ii) not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other Parties under this Agreement, and (iii) to waive any
requirement to post any bond, in each case, in connection with obtaining such
relief. All rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement shall be
cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this
Agreement or applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including
Section 12.3(a)), the Parties explicitly agree that no Seller Party, on the
one hand, and neither Parent nor the Buyer, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or other form of specific performance or
equitable relief described in Section 12.3(a), to cause (x) the Closing to be
consummated or (y) the Per Company Unit Consideration to be issued, unless
each of the following conditions has been satisfied:

  

  

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Article VII and Article VIII shall have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions shall be capable of being
satisfied); and

  

  

(ii) Parent and the Buyer or the Seller Parties, as applicable, are required
to complete the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and fail to
complete the Closing in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

  

12.4 Severability. Each section, subsection and lesser section of this
Agreement constitutes a separate and distinct undertaking, covenant and/or
provision hereof. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall
finally be determined to be unlawful, such provision shall be deemed severed
from this Agreement, but every other provision of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Parties will attempt in
good faith to agree to replace such unlawful provision with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other potential purposes of such unlawful provision.

  

  

12.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only
by execution of a written instrument signed by the Buyer and the Members'
Representative.

  

  

12.6 Waiver. Either Parent and the Buyer, on the one hand, or any Seller Party
or the Members' Representative, on the other hand, may to the extent permitted
by applicable Law (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the Seller Parties, the Members' Representative
or Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Seller Parties, the Members'
Representative or Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the Seller Parties, the Members' Representative or Parent and
the Buyer, as applicable, contained herein. No such extension or waiver shall
be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party extending the time of performance or waiving any such
inaccuracy or non-compliance. No waiver by any Party of any term of this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as
a waiver of the same or any other term of this Agreement on any future
occasion.

or at such other address or addresses as the Party or the Members'
Representative addressed may from time to time designate in writing pursuant
to notice given in accordance with this Section 12.7.

  

  

12.8 Expenses. Without limiting the effect of Article IX, all Expenses of the
Parties shall be borne by the Person incurring such Expense, except that if
the Transactions are consummated, the Company shall pay all Expenses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Members and the Members'
Representative, including any broker fees and expenses.

  

  

12.9 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Service of Process. The Parties agree
that any proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, shall be brought in any Chancery Court of the State of Delaware,
provided, that if (and only after) such courts determine that they lack
subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding,
such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the Federal courts
of the United States located in the State of Delaware. Each Party hereby
irrevocably (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts sitting in Delaware; (b) waives, and agrees not to assert, any claim
that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of, or any objection to the laying
of venue in, any such courts or that such action has been commenced in an
improper or inconvenient forum; and (c) agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Party's address as
provided herein shall be effective with respect to any matter for which it has
submitted to jurisdiction hereby. The foregoing shall not constitute a general
consent to service of process and shall have no effect for any purpose except
as set forth in this Section 12.9. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each Party (x) certifies that no Representative of
the other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (y) acknowledges that it and the other Party has been induced to enter
into the agreements contemplated hereby by, among other things, the mutual
waivers, agreements and certifications in this Section 12.9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.10 Arbitration.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 12.3, Section 12.9 and Section 12.10(d)
hereof, any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising in connection
with or related or incidental to, or question occurring under, this Agreement
or the subject matter hereof after the Closing shall be finally settled under
the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"), unless otherwise agreed, by an arbitral tribunal composed
of three (3) arbitrators, at least one (1) of whom shall be an attorney
experienced in corporate transactions, appointed by agreement of the Buyer and
the Members' Representative in accordance with said Rules. In the event the
Buyer and the Members' Representative fail to agree upon a panel of
arbitrators from the first list of potential arbitrators proposed by the AAA,
the AAA will submit a second list in accordance with such Rules. In the event
the Buyer and the Members' Representative shall have failed to agree upon a
full panel of arbitrators from such second list, any remaining arbitrators to
be selected shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with such Rules. If at
the time of the arbitration the Buyer and the Members' Representative agree in
writing to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator, such single arbitrator
shall be appointed by agreement of the Buyer and the Members' Representative
in connection with the foregoing procedure or failing such agreement by the
AAA in accordance with such Rules. All arbitrators shall be neutral
arbitrators and subject to Rule 19 of the Rules.

  

  

(b) The arbitrators shall apply the Laws of the State of Delaware, shall not
have the authority to add to, detract from, or modify any provision hereof and
shall not award punitive damages to any injured Party or to the Members'
Representative. A decision by a majority of the arbitrators shall be final,
conclusive and binding. The arbitrators shall deliver a written and reasoned
award with respect to the dispute to each of the parties to the dispute,
difference, controversy or claim, who shall promptly act in accordance
therewith. Any arbitration Proceeding shall be held in the State of Delaware.

  

  

(c) The arbitration Proceedings conducted pursuant hereto shall be
confidential. No Party shall disclose any information about the arbitration
Proceedings or the evidence adduced by the other Parties in any arbitration
Proceeding or about documents provided by the other Parties in connection with
the Proceeding except in the course of a judicial, regulatory or arbitration
Proceeding or as may be requested by a Governmental Authority or as required
or advisable under Law or exchange rules. Before making any disclosure
permitted by the preceding sentence, the Party intending to make such
disclosure shall give the other Parties reasonable written notice of the
intended disclosure. The Parties shall sign, and the arbitrator, expert
witnesses and stenographic reporters shall be asked to sign, appropriate non-
disclosure agreements or orders in order to effectuate this Agreement of the
Parties as to confidentiality.

  

  

(d) The Parties hereby exclude any right of appeal to any court on the merits
of the dispute. The provisions of this Section 12.10 may be enforced in any
court having jurisdiction over the award or any of the Parties or any of their
respective assets, and judgment on the award (including equitable remedies)
granted in any arbitration hereunder may be entered in any such court. Nothing
contained in this Section 12.10 shall prevent any Party from seeking
injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction,
without the need to resort to arbitration.

  

  

12.11 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
other documents expressly referred to herein, including all appendices,
exhibits and schedules hereto, and the other documents of even date herewith,
embody the complete agreement and understanding among the Parties and
supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or among the Parties, written or oral, that may have related to the subject
matter hereof (including, for avoidance of doubt, the Confidential Term Sheet
executed by the Parties or their related entities on January 28, 2014 and the
Non-Disclosure Agreement). Notwithstanding the right of a Party to investigate
the assets, properties, books, records and financial condition of the other
Party, and notwithstanding any knowledge obtained or obtainable by such Party
as a result of such investigation, such Party has the unqualified right to
rely upon, and has relied upon, each of the representations and warranties
made by the other Party in this Agreement or pursuant hereto. No information
or knowledge obtained or capable of being obtained in any investigation by a
Party (or in any list, certificate, schedule or other instrument, document,
agreement or writing furnished or to be furnished to or made pursuant hereto)
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the
other Parties contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the Transactions. No claim by a Party in connection with
this Agreement shall be adversely affected by any investigation by or
opportunity to investigate afforded to such Party, nor shall such a claim be
adversely affected by such Party's knowledge on or before the Closing Date of
any breach or of any state of facts that may give rise to such a breach. The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, shall not adversely affect the right to indemnification, payment
of Damages or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.12 Absence of Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Except for Article IX (which
shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties) and Section 6.18, no
provision of this Agreement is intended, nor will be interpreted, to provide
or create any third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind
in any client, customer, Affiliate, member, option holder, employee or partner
of any Party or any other Person.

  

  

12.13 Mutual Drafting. This Agreement is the mutual product of the Parties,
and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual consultation,
negotiation and agreement of each of the Parties, and shall not be construed
for or against any Party, but according to the application of the rules of

of Parent, the Buyer and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Alston and Bird LLP representing the Members and/or
their Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated herein(the "Engagement"). In addition, all communications

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Alston and Bird LLP in the course of
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions (the

its Subsidiaries shall have access to any such communications, or to the files
of Alston and Bird LLP within the Scope, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
last sentence of this paragraph, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Members
and their Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such communications and files within the Scope, and

property of the client, only the Members and their Affiliates shall hold such
property rights and (iii) Alston and Bird LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Alston and Bird LLP and any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Engagement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be afforded access to the
communications and files within the Scope in connection with defending any
Third Party Claims in which there is not a conflict of interest between the
Members and Parent or the Buyer to the extent that such access would not
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, including the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product privilege.

interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 6.7 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without
the prior written consent of the other Party.

  

  

Section 6.8 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by

otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words

Section 6.11 Specific Performance; Remedies. Each Stockholder acknowledges
that the Company and the Members shall be irreparably harmed and that there
shall be no adequate remedy at Law for any violation or breach, or threatened
breach, by any Stockholder of any of the covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, and that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by
a Stockholder, would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone.
It is accordingly agreed, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, that the Company and the Members shall have the right to
obtain injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of, the Stockholders' covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby agrees (i) to
waive the defense in any such suit that the Company or the Members have an
adequate remedy at law, (ii) not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants and obligations of the Stockholders under this Agreement,
and (iii) to waive any requirement to post any bond, in each case, in
connection with obtaining such relief. All rights and remedies of the Parties
under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more
rights or remedies shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or
remedy available under this Agreement or applicable Law.

  

  

Section 6.12 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Service of Process. The
Parties agree that any proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement,
prior to the Closing, shall be brought in any United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Virginia located in Alexandria, Virginia, or if such
court does not have jurisdiction, any Virginia state court in the City of
Alexandria with jurisdiction. Each Party hereby irrevocably (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in such
jurisdiction; (b) waives, and agrees not to assert, any claim that it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of, or any objection to the laying of venue in,
any such courts or that such action has been commenced in an improper or
inconvenient forum; and (c) agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Party's address as provided
herein shall be effective with respect to any matter for which it has
submitted to jurisdiction hereby. The foregoing shall not constitute a general
consent to service of process and shall have no effect for any purpose except
as set forth in this Section 6.12. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each Party (x) certifies that no Representative of
the other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (y) acknowledges that it and the other Party has been induced to enter
into the agreements contemplated hereby by, among other things, the mutual
waivers, agreements and certifications in this Section 6.12.

  

  

Section 6.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(including by facsimile), each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

  

  

Section 6.14 No Partnership, Agency or Joint Venture. This Agreement is
intended to create a contractual relationship between the Stockholders, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Members, on the other hand, and is not
intended to create, and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint
venture or any like relationship between or among the Parties hereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each of the Stockholders
(a) is entering into this Agreement solely on its own behalf and shall not
have any obligation to perform on behalf of any other holder of Parent Common
Stock or any liability (regardless of the legal theory advanced) for any
breach of this Agreement by any other holder of Parent Common Stock and (b) by
entering into this Agreement does not intend to form a "group" for purposes of
Rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the Exchange Act or any other similar provision of
applicable law.

CAPITALIZATION

  

  

Section 4.1 Authorized Capital Stock. The total number of shares of all
classes of capital stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue is [●]
shares, consisting of (a) [●] shares of class A common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), (b) [●] shares of class B

together with the Class A Common Stock, the "Common Stock") and (c) 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Preferred
Stock"). Subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of
Preferred Stock then outstanding, the number of authorized shares of any of
the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be
increased or decreased, in each case by the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, and no vote of the holders of any of the Class A Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class
will be required therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of
authorized shares of any particular class may not be decreased below the
number of shares of such class then outstanding plus, in the case of Class A
Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable in
connection with (i) the exchange of Class B Common Stock and Units (as defined
in Article XI) pursuant to the Tempus LLC Agreement (as defined in Article XI)
and (ii) the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, exchange rights,
conversion rights or similar rights for Class A Common Stock.

  

  

Section 4.2 Reclassification of Existing Common Stock. Upon this Amended and
Restated Certificate becoming effective pursuant to the DGCL, each share of
the Corporation's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and
outstanding or held in treasury, shall automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof be reclassified as and become one shares of
Class A Common Stock.

  

  

Section 4.3 Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to
time in one or more series. The Board is hereby expressly authorized to
provide for the issuance of shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more
series and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included
in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special
rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included in
a certificate of designations (a "Preferred Stock Designation") filed pursuant
to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the authority to
the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any such
resolution or resolutions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 4.4 Common Stock.

  

  

(a) Voting Rights.

  

  

(1) Each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, will be entitled to one vote
for each share of Class A Common Stock held of record by the holder on all
matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote.

  

  

(2) Each holder of Class B Common Stock, as such, will be entitled to one vote
for each share of Class B Common Stock held of record by the holder on all
matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote.

  

  

(3) Except as otherwise required by the DGCL or this Amended and Restated
Certificate, the holders of Common Stock will vote together as a single class
on all matters (or, if any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote
together with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with the holders
of such Preferred Stock).

  

  

(4) Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the
Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of
directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by
law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including a Preferred Stock
Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on
any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any
amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms
of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of
such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

  

  

(b) Dividends and Distributions.

  

  

(1) Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends and other distributions (payable in cash, property or
capital stock of the Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the
Board from time to time out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor, and shall share equally on a per share basis in such
dividends and distributions.

  

  

(2) Except as set forth in Section 4.4(b)(3) with respect to stock dividends,
dividends and other distributions shall not be declared or paid on the Class B
Common Stock.

  

  

(3) In no event will any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits,
combinations of stock, reclassifications or recapitalizations be declared or
made on any Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be,
unless contemporaneously therewith (a) all shares of Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock at the time outstanding are treated in the same
proportion and the same manner and (b) the stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination of stock, reclassification or
recapitalization has been reflected in the same economically equivalent manner
with respect to all Units. Stock dividends with respect to Class A Common
Stock may be paid only with Class A Common Stock. Stock dividends with respect
to Class B Common Stock may be paid only with Class B Common Stock; provided,
that the deemed transfer and retirement of shares of Class B Common Stock to
the Corporation pursuant to Section 4.4(e)(3) shall not be a transaction
subject to this Section 4.4(b)(3).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Subject to the rights, if any, of
the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the
rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock to exchange their shares of
Class B Common Stock and Units for shares of Class A Common Stock in
accordance with the Tempus LLC Agreement (or for the consideration payable in
respect of shares of Class A Common Stock in such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up), in the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, after
payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the
Corporation, the holders of the Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of the
Class A Common Stock held by them. Except as otherwise provided above with
respect to the exchange rights of holders of the Class B Common Stock under
the terms of the Tempus LLC Agreement, the holders of shares of Class B Common
Stock, as such, will not be entitled to receive, with respect to such shares,
any assets of the Corporation, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

  

  

(d) Transfer of Class B Common Stock.

  

  

(1) A holder of Class B Common Stock may only transfer such Class B Common
Stock (or a fraction thereof) to a transferee if the holder also transfers a
corresponding number of Units to the transferee (as such number may be
adjusted to reflect equitably any stock split, subdivision, combination or
similar change with respect to the Units or Class B Common Stock).

  

  

(2) Any purported transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock in violation of
the restriction described in Section 4.4(d)(1) (the "Restriction") shall be
null and void. If, notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition, a person shall,
voluntarily or involuntarily, purportedly become or attempt to become, the
purported owner ("Purported Owner") of shares of Class B Common Stock in
violation of the Restriction, then the Purported Owner shall not obtain any
rights in and to such shares of Class B Common Stock (the "Restricted
Shares"), and the purported transfer of the Restricted Shares to the Purported
Owner shall not be recognized by the Corporation's transfer agent (the
"Transfer Agent").

  

  

(3) Upon a determination by the Board that a person has attempted or may
attempt to transfer or to acquire Restricted Shares in violation of the
Restriction, the Board may take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to
give effect to such transfer or acquisition on the books and records of the
Corporation, including without limitation to cause the Transfer Agent to

(e) Exchange.

  

  

(1) Pursuant to the Tempus LLC Agreement, the holder of each Unit and share of
Class B Common Stock will have the right to exchange such Unit and share of
Class B Common Stock for one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock, on and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Tempus LLC Agreement. In connection with the
exercise of such exchange right, the Corporation shall issue the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of Units and shares of
Class B Common Stock surrendered by such holder (subject to the right of the
holder to elect, with the consent of the Company, to receive the Cash Amount
(as defined in the Tempus LLC Agreement) in lieu of the issuance of shares of
Class A Common Stock). The Corporation at all times shall have reserved for
issuance upon exchange of Units a sufficient number of shares of Class A
Common Stock as may from time to time be required for the exchange of all
outstanding Units by the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock.

  

  

(2) Any holder of Units who exercises the exchange right under the Tempus LLC
Agreement (including any such exercise in which the holder offers to receive
the Cash Amount in lieu of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock)
shall present and surrender, or cause to be presented and surrendered, to the
Corporation, the certificate or certificates, if any, representing the number
of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to the holder's number of Units
surrendered for exchange (either for shares of Class A Common Stock or the
Cash Amount) during the Corporation's normal business hours at any office or
agency of the Corporation maintained for the transfer of Class B Common Stock.
If so required by the Corporation, any certificate for shares surrendered for
cancellation shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
holder of such shares or his, her or its duly authorized representative.

  

  

(3) In case any certificate for shares of Class B Common Stock shall be
surrendered for cancellation of only a portion of the shares represented
thereby, the Corporation shall deliver at such office or agency of the
Corporation maintained for the transfer of Class B Common Stock, to or upon
the written order of the holder thereof, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Class B Common Stock represented by such surrendered
certificate that are not being cancelled.

  

  

(4) All shares of Class B Common Stock that shall have been surrendered for
cancellation as herein provided shall be deemed to be retired and may be
reissued only in connection with future issuances, if any, of Units, and all
rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and to vote, shall thereupon cease and terminate.

  

  

(5) If the number of Units held by any person is reduced pursuant to the terms
of the Tempus LLC Agreement, including as a result of the exercise of exchange
rights thereunder, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock owned by such
person shall be simultaneously reduced (without duplication of any Class B
Common Stock surrendered in connection with an exchange of Class B Common
Stock and Units for Class A Common Stock) so that the number of shares of
Class B Common Stock owned by such person does not exceed the number of Units
then owned by such person, and the excess number of such shares over the
number of Units owned by such person shall automatically and without further
action on the part of the Corporation or any holder of Class B Common Stock be
deemed to have been transferred to the Corporation and retired and all rights
with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices
and to vote, shall thereupon cease and terminate. All shares of Class B Common
Stock deemed transferred to the Corporation under this Section 4.4(e)(5) may
be reissued only in connection with future issuances, if any, of Units.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Legends. All certificates or book entries representing shares of Class B
Common Stock (or fractions thereof), as the case may be, shall bear a legend
substantially in the following form:

  

  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS [CERTIFICATE][BOOK ENTRY] ARE SUBJECT TO
THE RESTRICTIONS (INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER) SET FORTH IN THE
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION (A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF
THE CORPORATION AND SHALL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO ANY STOCKHOLDER MAKING
A REQUEST THEREFOR).

  

  

(g) Fractional Shares. The Class B Common Stock may be issued and transferred
in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder to exercise voting
rights and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Class B
Common Stock. Subject to the Restriction, holders of shares of Class B Common
Stock (or fractions thereof) shall be entitled to transfer fractions thereof
and the Corporation shall, and shall cause any transfer agent with respect to
the Class B Common Stock to, facilitate any such transfers, including by
issuing certificates or making book entries representing any such fractional
shares.

  

  

(h) Transfer Taxes. The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon the
exchange of Units under the terms of the Tempus LLC Agreement will be made
without charge to the holders of the shares of Class B Common Stock for any
stamp or other similar tax in respect of the issuance, unless any such shares
of Class A Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that of the then
record holder of the shares of Class B Common Stock being purchased, in which
case the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof will pay to the
Corporation the amount of any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issuance or will establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Corporation that the tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

Section 4.5 Rights and Options. The Corporation has the authority to create
and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof to
purchase shares of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock or
other securities of the Corporation, and such rights, warrants and options
shall be evidenced by instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is
empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other
terms and conditions of such rights, warrants or options; provided, however,
that the consideration to be received for any shares of capital stock subject
thereto may not be less than the par value thereof.

ARTICLE V

  

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  

  

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers
and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Amended and
Restated Certificate or the Bylaws ("Bylaws") of the Corporation, the Board is
hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things
as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate and any Bylaws
adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter
adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that
would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

  

  

Section 5.2 Number, Election and Term.

  

  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board;
provided, that, for so long as the Orion Members (as such term is defined in
the Tempus LLC Agreement, the "Orion Members") hold at least 45% of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, the number of
directors of the Corporation shall be 7 unless otherwise consented to by the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation held by the Orion Members. For purposes of
this Amended and Restated Certificate, "Whole Board" shall mean the total
number of directors the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to Class I, Class II and Class III. The term of the initial
Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated
Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the
second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the
initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended
and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this
Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose
term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term.
Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any
increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as
to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible,
but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of
any incumbent director.

  

  

(c) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  

  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.3 Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies. Subject to Section 5.5
hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number
of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely by a
majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and any
director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the
class of directors to which the new directorship was added or in which the
vacancy occurred and until his or her successor has been elected and
qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal; provided, that, any vacancy created
by the removal of a director pursuant to Section 5.4 during the Specified
Period may be filled by the stockholders of the Corporation holding a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporations entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

  

  

Section 5.4 Removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class;
provided, that, for so long as the Orion Members hold a majority of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (such period, the
"Specified Period"), any or all of the directors may be removed from office
without cause.

  

  

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock -- Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the
holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right,
voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term
of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other
features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series
of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be
included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless
expressly provided by such terms.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

BYLAWS

  

  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board shall be required to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws pursuant to the preceding sentence.
The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the
stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or
by this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

  

  

Section 7.1 Meetings. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding
series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of applicable law,
special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, or the
Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, and
the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is hereby
specifically denied.

  

  

Section 7.2 Advance Notice. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the
election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner
provided in the Bylaws.

  

  

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be
taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called
annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by written
consent of the stockholders; provided, that, the actions contemplated by the
proviso to Section 5.3 and the proviso to Section 5.4 may be effected by
written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation (holding a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors) in lieu
of a meeting.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation
shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or
repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or
repeal.

  

  

Section 8.2 Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.

  

  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a
"proceeding") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
an employee benefit plan (an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The
Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay
the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in
defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable
law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the
proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf
of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this
Section 8.2 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses conferred by this Section 8.2 shall be contract rights and such
rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8.2(a), except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance
expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

BB-9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any
indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that
any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Amended and
Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  

  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2,
shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the
extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when
such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of,
or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment
or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  

  

(d) This Section 8.2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  

  

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall
not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors
or in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict
with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have currently
or in the future.

conditions of this Agreement and the Delaware Act. No provision of this
Agreement shall be in violation of the Delaware Act and to the extent any
provision of this Agreement is in violation of the Delaware Act, such
provision shall be void and of no effect to the extent of such violation
without affecting the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, that where the Delaware Act provides that a provision of
the Delaware Act shall apply "unless otherwise provided in a limited liability
company agreement" or words of similar effect, the provisions of this
Agreement shall in each instance control. Notwithstanding any provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Orion Members shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 18-210 of the Delaware Act, which provisions shall apply
to the Company and shall be incorporated into this Agreement; provided, that,

partner or joint venturer of any other Member by virtue of this Agreement, for
any purposes (including Section 303 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code), and

action to cause the Company to not be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, if applicable, state or
local income tax purposes, without the prior written consent of all of the
Orion Members. The Members intend that their Capital Contributions are to be
treated as part of an integrated transaction that qualifies as an exchange
under Code Section 351 and the Company and the Members shall file all tax
returns in a manner consistent with such treatment. The Company and the Parent
shall cooperate with the Orion Members, as reasonably requested by the
Members' Representative (as defined in the Equity Transfer and Acquisition
Agreement) or by the Orion Members holding a majority of the Units held by all
Orion Members, to allow them to exchange their Units for Class A Stock in

if any, shall be concurrently transferred by Parent to the Company; provided,

issue any new Units in connection therewith and Parent shall not be required
to transfer such net proceeds to the Company (it being understood that such
net proceeds shall instead be transferred to such Member as consideration for
such purchase). Except pursuant to Section 10.1, (x) the Company may not issue
any additional Units to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially
simultaneously Parent or such Subsidiary issues or sells an equal number of
shares of Parent's Class A Stock to another Person, and (y) the Company may
not issue any other Equity Securities of the Company to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously Parent or such Subsidiary
issues or sells, to another Person, an equal number of shares of a new class
or series of Equity Securities of Parent or such Subsidiary with substantially
the same rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
the Company. Without the consent of the Members other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries, the Company may not issue additional Units or other Equity
Securities of the Company to any Person other than (i) to Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) to the Members other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, in
each case, in accordance with this Section 3.2. This Section 3.2(d) shall not
apply to the issuance and distribution to holders of shares of Class A Stock
of rights to purchase Equity Securities of Parent under a "poison pill" or
similar shareholders rights plan (it being understood that upon exchange of
Units for Class A Stock as provided in Article X hereof, such Class A Stock
will be issued together with a corresponding right), or the issuance under
Parent's employee benefit plans of any warrants, options or other rights to
acquire Equity Securities of Parent or rights or property that may be
converted into or settled in Equity Securities of Parent, but this Section
3.2(d) shall in each of the foregoing cases apply to the issuance of Equity
Securities of Parent in connection with the exercise or settlement of such
rights, warrants, options or other rights or property.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-9  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Parent and any of its Subsidiaries may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of Class A Stock unless substantially simultaneously the
Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires (and the Company agrees to
so redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire) from Parent (and Parent agrees to
deliver to the Company) an equal number of Units for the same price per
security. Parent and any of its Subsidiaries may not redeem or repurchase any
other Equity Securities of Parent unless substantially simultaneously the
Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires (and the Company agrees to
so redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire) from Parent (and Parent agrees to
deliver to the Company) an equal number of Equity Securities of the Company of
a corresponding class or series with substantially the same rights to
dividends and distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and
other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of Parent for the
same price per security. Except pursuant to Section 10.1, (A) the Company may
not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Units from Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously Parent or such Subsidiary
redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires an equal number of shares of Class
A Stock for the same price per security from holders thereof, and (B) the
Company may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any other Equity
Securities of the Company from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries unless
substantially simultaneously Parent or such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or
otherwise acquires for the same price per security an equal number of Equity
Securities of Parent of a corresponding class or series with substantially the
same rights to dividends and distributions (including distribution upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any consideration
payable to or by Parent in connection with the redemption or repurchase of any
shares of Class A Stock or other Equity Securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries consists (in whole or in part) of shares of Class A Stock or such
other Equity Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with the cashless exercise of an option or warrant), then the redemption or
repurchase of the corresponding Units or other Equity Securities of the
Company shall be effectuated in an equivalent manner.

  

  

(f) The Company shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by any unit
split, unit dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the outstanding Units or other outstanding Equity Securities
unless accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable,
of the outstanding Parent Common Stock or other outstanding corresponding
Equity Securities, with corresponding changes made with respect to any other
exchangeable or convertible securities. Parent shall not in any manner effect
any subdivision (by any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Parent
Common Stock or other outstanding Equity Securities unless accompanied by an
identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding Units
or other outstanding corresponding Equity Securities, with corresponding
changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or convertible securities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-10  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(g) So long as the Orion Members (and Permitted Transferees) collectively
beneficially own at least 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock, Parent agrees (i) not to form any direct or indirect Subsidiary
other than (A) a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company or (B) a
Subsidiary that is a holding company (that does not itself conduct business)
of which Parent is the direct or indirect owner of 100% of its outstanding
Equity Securities; and (ii) that any Subsidiaries of Parent that are not
Subsidiaries of the Company shall not issue any of their Equity Securities to
any Person other than Parent or a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent. The provisions of this Section 3.2(g) may be waived by the consent
of the Members' Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

3.3 Capital Contributions; Unit Ownership; Issuance of Additional Units.

  

  

(a) Capital Contributions; Schedule of Unitholders. Each Member named on
Schedule I and the Capital Contributions made by each such Member are set
forth on Schedule I opposite such Member's name in respect of its Units
specified thereon. No Member shall be required to make additional Capital
Contributions. The Company may issue fractional Units.

  

  

(b) Issuance of Additional Units or Interests. To the extent, but only to the
extent, expressly permitted by Section 3.2, and subject to the limitations
thereof, the Manager shall have the right to authorize and cause the Company
to issue on such terms (including price) as may be determined by the Manager
additional Units or other Equity Securities in the Company (including creating
preferred interests or other classes or series of securities having such
rights, preferences and privileges as determined by the Managing Member);
provided that, at any time following the date hereof, in each case the Company
shall not issue Equity Securities in the Company to any Person unless such
Person shall have executed a counterpart to this Agreement and all other
documents, agreements or instruments deemed necessary or desirable in the
discretion of the Manager. In that event, the Manager shall amend Schedule I
to reflect such additional issuances and resulting dilution, which shall be
borne pro rata by all Members including Parent based on their Units and the
respective terms thereof.

  

  

3.4 Certificates Representing Units.

  

  

(a) Units shall not be certificated unless otherwise determined by the
Manager. If the Manager determines that one or more Units shall be
certificated, each such certificate shall be signed by or in the name of the
Company, by the Chief Executive Officer or any other officer designated by the
Manager, representing the number of Units held by such holder. Such
certificate shall be in such form (and shall contain such legends), consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, as the Manager may reasonably determine. Any
or all of such signatures on any certificate representing one or more Units
may be a facsimile, engraved or printed, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

  

  

(b) If Units are certificated, the Manager shall direct that a new certificate
representing one or more Units be issued in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon delivery to the Manager of an affidavit of the owner or owners
of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Manager may require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal
representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to indemnify it against
any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new
certificate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the Company, if
any, of a certificate for one or more Units, duly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, in
compliance with the provisions hereof, the Company shall issue a new
certificate representing one or more Units to the Person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

  

  

3.5 No Withdrawal. No Person shall be entitled to withdraw any part of such
Person's Capital Contribution or to receive any Distribution from the Company,
except as expressly provided herein.

  

  

3.6 Loans From Members. Loans by Members to the Company shall not be
considered Capital Contributions. The amount of any such advances shall be a
debt of the Company to such Member and shall be payable or collectible in
accordance with the terms and conditions upon which such advances are made. No
Member shall be required or, except as approved by the Manager and in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement, permitted to loan any
money or property to the Company or borrow any money or property from the
Company.

DISTRIBUTIONS

  

  

4.1 Distributions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder,
Distributions to Members may be declared by the Manager out of Distributable
Cash or other funds or property legally available therefor in such amounts and
on such terms (including the payment dates of such Distributions) as the
Manager shall determine using such record date as the Manager may designate;
such Distributions shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on
such record date on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Units held
by each Member as of the close of business on such record date. Promptly
following the designation of a record date and the declaration of a
Distribution pursuant to this Section 4.1, the Manager shall give notice to
each Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the Distribution
and the payment date thereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
4.1, the Manager, in its sole discretion, may authorize that cash be paid by
the Company to Parent or any Orion Member in exchange for the redemption,
repurchase or other acquisition of such Member's Units, provided that if such
non-pro rata cash payment is made to Parent, substantially simultaneously
therewith, such cash shall be used to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire
an equal number of shares of Class A Stock.

  

  

4.2 Restricted Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any Distribution to
any Member on account of any Units if such Distribution would render the
Company insolvent or otherwise violate any applicable Law.

ARTICLE V

  

  

MANAGEMENT

  

  

5.1 Authority of Manager.

  

  

(a) Except for situations in which the approval of any Member(s) is
specifically required by this Agreement, (i) all management powers over the
business and affairs of the Company shall be exclusively vested in one manager
(the "Manager") that shall be Parent (or its successor) and (ii) the Manager
shall conduct, direct and exercise full control over all activities of the
Company. The Manager shall be the "manager" of the Company for the purposes of
the Delaware Act. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein and
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Members hereby consent
to the exercise by the Manager of all such powers and rights conferred on the
Members by the Delaware Act with respect to the management and control of the
Company. Parent may not be removed as a Manager except as provided in Section
5.4. Any Manager that is properly removed pursuant to Section 5.4 shall be
replaced in the manner provided in Section 5.4.

  

  

(b) The day-to-day business and operations of the Company shall be overseen
and implemented by officers of the Company (each, an "Officer" and
collectively, the "Officers"), subject to the limitations imposed by the
Manager. An Officer may, but need not, be a Member. Each Officer shall be
appointed by the Manager and shall hold office until his or her successor
shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her death or until
he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided.
Any one Person may hold more than one office. Subject to the other provisions
in this Agreement (including in Section 5.7 below), the salaries or other
compensation, if any, of the Officers of the Company shall be fixed from time
to time by the Manager. The authority and responsibility of the Officers shall
include, but not be limited to, such duties as the Manager may, from time to
time, delegate to them and the carrying out of the Company's business and
affairs on a day-today basis.

  

  

(c) In connection with the performance of its duties as the Manager, the
Manager acknowledges that, in its capacity as Manager, it will owe to the
Members (including Parent on behalf of its stockholders) the same fiduciary
duties as it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware corporation if it
were a member of the board of directors of such a corporation and the Members
were stockholders of such corporation. The parties acknowledge that the
Manager will take action by direction from its board of directors, and that
the members of Parent's board of directors will owe comparable fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Parent. Parent will use all commercially
reasonable and appropriate efforts and means to minimize any conflict of
interest between the Members, on the one hand, and Parent's stockholders, on
the other hand, and to effectuate any transaction that involves or affects any
of Parent, the Company, the Manager, the Members and/or Parent's stockholders
in a manner that does not (i) disadvantage the Members or their interests
relative to those of Parent's stockholders, (ii) disadvantage Parent's
stockholders or their interests relative to those of the Members or (iii)
advantage Parent's stockholders or their interests relative to those of the
Members, or (iv) advantage the Members or their interests relative to those of
Parent's stockholders, except in each case, as would arise from the express
provisions of this Agreement or as contemplated by the Equity Transfer and
Acquisition Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, (A) Parent's board of
directors shall establish one or more committees composed entirely of
independent directors with the authority to act on behalf of the board with
respect to any matters relating to (i) any transaction between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and a Related Person, (ii) the enforcement of any
rights or remedies of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Equity
Transfer and Acquisition Agreement and the other documents contemplated
thereby (including the Transaction Documents and the Employment Agreements, as
defined therein), including the pursuit or defense of any claim for
indemnification, and (iii) agreeing to any consent under, waiver of, or
amendment to any of such agreements, and (B) Parent shall not avail itself of
the "controlled company" exemption from certain corporate governance
requirements under Nasdaq Rule 5615(c), even if Parent is eligible to do so.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-13  

  

 

 

  

 

  

5.2 Restriction on Authority of Manager. So long as the Orion Members
beneficially own at least 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock, the approval of Orion Members holding a majority of the Units
then held by all Orion Members will be required before the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries may take any of the following actions:

  

  

(a) entering into any agreement to effect or consummate a Change of Control
Transaction or a change in the Manager;

  

  

(b) entering into any agreement to effect or consummate any merger or
consolidation of the Company or any merger or consolidation of any Subsidiary
of the Company, except, only for purposes of this clause (b), that (x) any
Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve or merge or consolidate into the Company
in a transaction in which the Company is the surviving corporation, (y) any
Subsidiary may merge into or consolidate with any other Subsidiary in a
transaction in which the surviving entity is a Subsidiary and (z) any
Subsidiary may merge or consolidate with another Person in a transaction in
which the surviving entity is such Subsidiary;

  

  

(c) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of
property or assets (including capital stock of any Subsidiary), whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person
other than the Company or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries in any one transaction
or series of related transactions outside of the ordinary course of business
for aggregate consideration in an amount in excess of $5,000,000;

  

  

(d) entering into any agreement with respect to or consummating any
acquisition by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any business or assets
having a fair market value in excess of $5,000,000 taken as a whole, in any
one transaction or series of related transactions, whether by purchase and
sale, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or otherwise;

  

  

(e) changing the purpose of the Company, or the entering into of any
materially different line of business or substantially changing the strategic
business plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries from those in effect on the
date hereof;

  

  

(f) incurring any funded indebtedness (including the refinancing of any funded
indebtedness) or repaying before due any funded indebtedness (other than a
working capital revolving line of credit) with a fixed term in either case, in
a single transaction or in two or more transactions (related or unrelated) in
an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000 per year;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-14  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(g) settling claims or suits in which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a
party for an amount that exceeds the relevant provision in the budget by more
than $5,000,000 (including any related litigation expenses) or where equitable
or injunctive relief is included as part of such settlement or entering into
any consent decree or similar binding order with any governmental agency;

  

  

(h) entering into any agreement, or the modification or termination of any
agreement, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with, or for the benefit
of, any holder of Class A Stock of the Parent who beneficially owns five
percent or more of the Class A Stock of the Parent or any affiliate of such a
shareholder;

  

  

(i) except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, declaring, setting
aside or paying any redemption of, or distributions with respect to,
membership interests, payable in cash, property or otherwise;

  

  

(j) dissolving of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, adopting a plan of
liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or effecting any action
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to commence any suit, case,
proceeding or other action: (x) under any existing or future law of any
jurisdiction relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of
debtors seeking to have an order for relief entered with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or seeking to adjudicate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment winding up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or
other relief with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (y)
seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar
official for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for all or any
material portion of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
making a general assignment for the benefit of the creditors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

5.3 Actions of the Manager. The Manager may act through any Person or Persons
to whom authority and duties have been delegated pursuant to Section 5.6.

  

  

5.4 Resignation or Termination of the Manager. Parent shall not, by any means,
resign as, cease to be or be replaced as the Company's Manager except in
compliance with this Section 5.4. No termination or replacement of Parent as
the Company's Manager shall be effective unless any such new Manager is also a
Subsidiary of Parent (or its successor in a transaction in which Parent ceases
to exist) or acting under the contractual direction and control of Parent or
any such Subsidiary and proper provision is made, in compliance with this
Agreement, so that the obligations of Parent, its successor (if applicable)
and any new Manager and the rights of all Members under this Agreement and
applicable Law remain in full force and effect. No appointment of a Person
other than Parent (or its successor) as the Company's Manager shall be
effective unless Parent (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Manager
(as applicable) provide all other Members with contractual rights, directly
enforceable by such other Members against Parent (or its successor, as
applicable) and the new Manager (as applicable), to cause (a) Parent (or its
successor) to comply with all of Parent's obligations under this Agreement
other than those that must necessarily be taken in its capacity as the
Company's Manager and (b) the new Manager to comply with all of the Manager's
obligations under this Agreement including those obligations of Parent that
relate to its exercise of authority as Manager.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.5 No Inconsistent Obligations. The Manager represents that it does not have
any contracts, other agreements, duties or obligations that are inconsistent
with its duties and obligations (whether or not in its capacity as the
Manager) under this Agreement and covenants that it will not enter into any
contracts or other agreements or undertake or acquire any other duties or
obligations that are inconsistent with such duties and obligations.

  

  

5.6 Delegation of Authority. The Manager (a) may, from time to time, delegate
to one or more Persons such authority and duties as the Manager may deem
advisable, and (b) may assign titles (including, without limitation, chief
executive officer, president, principal, vice president, secretary, assistant
secretary, treasurer, or assistant treasurer) and delegate certain authority
and duties to such Persons as the same may be amended, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time. Any number of titles may be held by the same
individual. The salaries or other compensation, if any, of such agents of the
Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Manager, subject to the other
provisions in this Agreement.

  

  

5.7 Limitation of Liability of Manager. Except as otherwise provided herein or
in an agreement entered into by such Person and the Company, neither the
Manager nor any of the Manager's Affiliates shall be liable to the Company or
to any Member for any act or omission performed or omitted by the Manager in
its capacity as the Manager of the Company pursuant to authority granted to
the Manager by this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the duties and obligations of the Manager under the provisions of
Section 5.1(c) hereof, and, except as otherwise provided herein, such
limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent the act or omission was
attributable to the Manager's gross negligence, willful misconduct, knowing
breach of this Agreement, or knowing violation of law. The Manager may
exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of
the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its
agents, and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the
part of any such agent (so long as such agent was selected in good faith and
with reasonable care). The Manager shall be entitled to rely upon the advice
of legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts, including
financial advisors, and any act of or failure to act by the Manager in good
faith reliance on such advice shall in no event subject the Manager to
liability to the Company or any Member except to the extent Manager or its
Affiliates received an improper personal benefit.

  

  

5.8 Investment Company Act. The Manager shall use its best efforts to ensure
that the Company shall not be subject to registration as an investment company
pursuant to the Investment Company Act.

  

  

5.9 Parent Dividends and Distributions. Except as otherwise determined by
Parent with the consent of the Orion Members, Parent shall not make any
dividend or other distribution on any shares of Class A Stock (other than a
dividend payable entirely in shares of capital stock of Parent that is made in
accordance with Section 3.2) except solely with the proceeds of distributions
received by Parent in respect of Units pursuant to Section 4.1 that are paid
pro rata to all holders of Units.

ARTICLE VI 
 

  

  

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

  

  

6.1 Limitation of Liability of Members.

  

  

(a) Except as provided in this Agreement or in the Delaware Act, the debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort
or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the
Company and no Member (including without limitation, the Manager) shall be
obligated personally for any such debts, obligation or liability solely by
reason of being a Member or acting as the Manager of the Company. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Member's liability (in its capacity as
such) for Company liabilities and Losses shall be limited to the Company's
assets. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the failure
of the Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the
exercise of its powers or management of its business and affairs under this
Agreement or the Delaware Act shall not be grounds for imposing personal
liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.

  

  

(b) In accordance with the Delaware Act and the laws of the State of Delaware,
a Member may, under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts
previously distributed to such Member. It is the intent of the Members that no
Distribution to any Member pursuant to ARTICLE IV shall be deemed a return of
money or other property paid or distributed in violation of the Delaware Act.
The payment of any such money or Distribution of any such property to a Member
shall be deemed to be a compromise within the meaning of Section 18-502(b) of
the Delaware Act, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Member
receiving any such money or property shall not be required to return any such
money or property to the Company or any other Person. However, if any court of
competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Agreement, any Member is obligated to make any such payment, such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member.

  

  

6.2 Lack of Authority. No Member, other than the Manager, in its capacity as
such, has the authority or power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do
any act that would be binding on the Company or to make any expenditure on
behalf of the Company. The Members hereby consent to the exercise by the
Manager of the powers conferred on them by law and this Agreement.

  

  

6.3 No Right of Partition. No Member, other than the Manager, shall have the
right to seek or obtain partition by court decree or operation of law of any
Company property, or the right to own or use particular or individual assets
of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-17  

  

 

 

  

 

  

6.4 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Person (each
an "Indemnified Person") to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware
Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, substituted or
replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement
only to the extent that such amendment, substitution or replacement permits
the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than the Company is
providing immediately prior to such amendment), against all expenses,
liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise
taxes or penalties) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or one or
more of such Person's Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such Person is or
was a Member or is or was serving as the Manager, Officer, principal, employee
or other agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the
Company as a manager, officer, director, principal, member, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise; provided, however, that no Indemnified Person shall
be indemnified for any expenses, liabilities and losses suffered that are
attributable to such Indemnified Person's or its Affiliates' gross negligence,
willful misconduct or knowing violation of law or for any present or future
breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants by such Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates contained herein. Expenses, including attorneys'
fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding shall
be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding,
including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company.

  

  

(b) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in
this Section 6.4 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, by-law, action by
the Manager or otherwise.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including in
this Section 6.4), any indemnity by the Company relating to the matters
covered in this Section 6.4 shall be provided out of and to the extent of
Company assets only and no Member (unless such Member otherwise agrees in
writing or is found in a final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
to have personal liability on account thereof) shall have personal liability
on account thereof or shall be required to make additional Capital
Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company.

  

  

(d) If this Section 6.4 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person pursuant to
this Section 6.4 to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Section 6.4 that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

  

  

6.5 Members Right to Act. For matters that require the approval of the
Members, the Members shall act through meetings and written consents as
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) below:

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, the vote of
Members (or a subset thereof) holding a majority of the Units (or a majority
of the Units held by such subset), voting together as a single class, shall be
the act of the Members (or subset thereof). Any Member entitled to vote at a
meeting of Members or to express consent or dissent to Company action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
it by proxy. An electronic mail, telegram, telex, cablegram or similar
transmission by the Member, or a photographic, photostatic, facsimile or
similar reproduction of a writing executed by the Member shall (if stated
thereon) be treated as a proxy executed in writing for purposes of this
Section 6.5(a). No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven (11) months
from the date thereof, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy
shall be revocable unless the proxy form conspicuously states that the proxy
is irrevocable and that the proxy is coupled with an interest. Should a proxy
designate two or more Persons to act as proxies, unless that instrument shall
provide to the contrary, a majority of such Persons present at any meeting at
which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise
all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or, if only one
be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even
number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, the Company
shall not be required to recognize such proxy with respect to such issue if
such proxy does not specify how the votes that are the subject of such proxy
are to be voted with respect to such issue.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The actions by the Members permitted hereunder may be taken at a meeting
called by the Manager or by the Members holding a majority of the Units on at
least 48 hours' prior written notice to the other Members, which notice shall
state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is being called. Actions
taken by the Members at any meeting (as opposed to by written consent),
however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting
duly held after regular call and notice if (but not until), either before, at
or after the meeting, the Members as to whom it was improperly held signs a
written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an
approval of the minutes thereof. Actions by the Members may be taken by vote
of the Members at a meeting or by written consent, so long as such consent is
signed by Members having not less than the minimum number of Units that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
Members were present and voted. Prompt notice of the action so taken, which
shall state the purpose or purposes for which such consent is required and may
be delivered via email, shall be given to those Members who have not consented
in writing; provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice shall
not affect the validity of the action taken by such written consent. Any
action taken pursuant to such written consent of the Members shall have the
same force and effect as if taken by the Members at a meeting thereof.

  

  

6.6 Inspection Rights. The Company shall permit each Member and each of its
designated representatives to (i) visit and inspect any of the properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, all at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice, (ii) examine the corporate and financial records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom, (iii)
consult with the managers, officers, employees and independent accountants of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the affairs, finances and
accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The presentation of an
executed copy of this Agreement by any Member to the Company's independent
accountants shall constitute the Company's permission to its independent
accountants to participate in discussions with such Persons and their
respective designated representatives.

7.1 Records and Accounting. The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept,
appropriate books and records with respect to the Company's business,
including all books and records necessary to provide any information, lists
and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to Section 7.3 or
pursuant to applicable laws. All matters concerning (a) the determination of
the relative amount of Distributions among the Members pursuant to ARTICLE IV
and (b) accounting procedures and determinations, and other determinations not
specifically and expressly provided for by the terms of this Agreement, shall
be determined by the Manager, whose determination shall be final and
conclusive as to all of the Members absent manifest clerical error.

each year or such other date as may be established by the Manager.

authority to cause the Company to prepare its tax returns using such
permissible methods and elections as it determines in its reasonable
discretion.

  

  

ARTICLE IX 
 

  

  

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF UNITS

  

  

9.1 Transfers by Members. No holder of Units may Transfer any Units or any
interest therein, except for Transfers (each, a "Permitted Transfer") (a) to
one or more Permitted Transferees, (b) in accordance with the provisions of
Article X, (c) in the form of a pledge, hypothecation or encumbrance of Units
to the extent permitted by Section 4(a)(ii) of the Registration Rights
Agreement or (d) approved in writing by the Manager. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, "Transfer" shall not include an event that terminates the existence
of a Member for income tax purposes (including, without limitation, a change
in entity classification of a Member under Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3, termination of a partnership pursuant to Code Section
708(b)(1)(B), a sale of assets by, or liquidation of, a Member pursuant to an
election under Code Section 338, or merger, severance, or allocation within a
trust or among sub-trusts of a trust that is a Member), but that does not
terminate the existence of such Member under applicable state law. In the
event of any Permitted Transfer by an Orion Member, such Orion Members shall
be required to also transfer the number of such Orion Member's Class B Stock
equal to the number of such Orion Member's Units that were transferred in the
transaction to such transferee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-20  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not Transfer any of the Units acquired by them other than
to Parent or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

  

  

9.2 Restricted Units Legend. The Units have not been registered under the
Securities Act and, therefore, in addition to the other restrictions on
Transfer contained in this Agreement, cannot be sold unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
then available. To the extent such Units have been certificated, each
certificate evidencing Units and each certificate issued in exchange for or
upon the Transfer of any Units (if such securities remain Units as defined
herein after such Transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form:

  

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED ON [ ],
AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"ACT"), AND, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR AN EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SPECIFIED IN THE
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF THE TEMPUS GROUP
HOLDINGS, LLC, AS MAY BE AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE
TEMPUS GROUP HOLDINGS, LLC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH
SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO ANY
TRANSFER. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS SHALL BE FURNISHED BY THE TEMPUS GROUP
HOLDINGS, LLC TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE."

  

  

The Company shall imprint such legend on certificates (if any) evidencing
Units. The legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificates (if
any) evidencing any units which cease to be Units in accordance with the
definition thereof.

  

  

9.3 Transfer. Prior to Transferring any Units, the Transferring holder of
Units shall cause the prospective Transferee to be bound by this Agreement and
any other agreements executed by the holders of Units and relating to such
Units in the aggregate (collectively, the "Other Agreements"), and shall cause
the prospective Transferee to execute and deliver to the Company and the other
holders of Units counterparts of this Agreement and any applicable Other
Agreements. Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Units in violation of
any provision of this Agreement (including any prohibited indirect Transfers)
(a) shall be void, and (b) the Company shall not record such Transfer on its
books and shall only treat a purported Transferee of such Units as an Assignee
thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-21  

  

 

 

  

 

  

9.4 Assignee's Rights.

  

  

(a) The Transfer of a Unit in accordance with this Agreement shall be
effective as of the date of its assignment (assuming compliance with all of
the conditions to such Transfer set forth herein), and such Transfer shall be
shown on the books and records of the Company. Distributions made before the
effective date of such Transfer shall be paid to the transferor, and
Distributions made after such date shall be paid to the Assignee.

  

  

(b) Unless and until an Assignee becomes a Member pursuant to ARTICLE XI, the
Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Member
hereunder or under applicable law, other than the rights granted specifically
to Assignees pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that, without
relieving the transferring Member from any such limitations or obligations as
more fully described in Section 9.5, such Assignee shall be bound by any
limitations and obligations of a Member contained herein that a Member would
be bound on account of the Assignee's membership interest in the Company
(including the obligation to make Capital Contributions on account of such
membership interest).

  

  

9.5 Assignor's Rights and Obligations. Any Member who shall Transfer any Units
in a manner in accordance with this Agreement shall cease to be a Member with
respect to such Units and shall no longer have any rights or privileges of a
Member with respect to such Units (it being understood, however, that the
applicable provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.4 shall continue to inure to such
Person's benefit), or any duties, liabilities or obligations, of a Member with
respect to such Units, except that unless and until the Assignee (if not
already a Member) is admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with the
provisions of ARTICLE XI (the "Admission Date"), such assigning Member shall
retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member with respect
to such Units, and nothing contained herein shall relieve any Member who
Transfers any Units from any liability of such Member to the Company with
respect to such Units that may exist on the Admission Date or that is
otherwise specified in the Delaware Act or for any liability to the Company or
any other Person for any materially false statement made by such Member (in
its capacity as such) or for any present or future breaches of any
representations, warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity as
such) contained herein or in any other agreement with the Company.

  

  

9.6 Overriding Provisions.

  

  

(a) Any Transfer in violation of this ARTICLE IX shall be null and void ab
initio, and the provisions of Sections 9.4 and 9.5 shall not apply to any such
Transfers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person to whom a Transfer is made
or attempted in violation of this ARTICLE IX shall not become a Member, shall
not be entitled to vote on any matters coming before the Members and shall not
have any other rights in or with respect to any rights of a Member of the
Company. The approval of any Transfer in any one or more instances shall not
limit or waive the requirement for such approval in any other or future
instance. The Manager shall promptly amend the Schedule of Members to reflect
any Permitted Transfer pursuant to this ARTICLE IX.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section 9.1 and ARTICLE XI), in
no event shall any Member Transfer (excluding for purposes of this Section 9.6
an exchange or other transaction provided in Article X hereof) any Units to
the extent such Transfer would:

  

  

(i) result in the violation of the Securities Act, or any other applicable
federal, state or foreign laws;

  

  

(ii) cause an assignment under the Investment Company Act;

  

  

(iii) be a violation of or a default (or an event that, with notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in an
acceleration of any indebtedness under, any note, mortgage, loan agreement or
similar instrument or document to which the Company or the Manager is a party;
or

  

  

(iv) be a Transfer to a Person who is not legally competent or who has not
achieved his or her majority under applicable Law (excluding trusts for the
benefit of minors).

  

  

ARTICLE X 
 

  

  

REDEMPTION AND EXCHANGE RIGHTS

  

  

10.1 Exchange of Units.

  

  

(a) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10.1(d) and subject to
Parent's rights described in Section 10.1(g), each of the Members shall be
entitled to exchange with Parent at any time and from time to time, any or all
of such Member's Units (and an equal number of shares of Class B Stock), as
follows: one Unit (and one share of Class B Stock) will be exchangeable for
one share of Class A Stock. Each such exchange shall be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a sale of the exchanging Member's Units and Class B
Stock to Parent in exchange for Class A Stock.

  

  

(b) In order to exercise the exchange right under Section 10.1(a), the
exchanging Member shall present and surrender the certificate or certificates
representing such Units (if certificated) during usual business hours at the
principal executive office of Parent accompanied by written notice (the
"Exchange Notice") to Parent and (if there is one) the Transfer Agent stating
that the exchanging Member elects to exchange with Parent a stated number of
Units represented, if applicable, by such certificate or certificates, to the
extent specified in such notice, and (if the Class A Stock to be received is
to be issued other than in the name of the exchanging Member) specifying the
name(s) of the Person(s) in whose name or on whose order the Class A Stock is
to be issued.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If required by Parent, any certificate for Units (if certificated)
surrendered for exchange with Parent shall be accompanied by instruments of
transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, duly executed by the
holder of such Units or such holder's duly authorized representative. As
promptly as practicable after the receipt of such notice and the surrender to
the Transfer Agent (or Parent if no Transfer Agent exists) of the certificate
or certificates, if any, representing such Units and shares of Class B Stock
(but in any event by the Exchange Date, as defined below), Parent shall issue
and deliver at such office to such holder, or on such holder's written order,
a certificate or certificates, if applicable, for the number of full shares of
Class A Stock issuable upon such exchange. Each exchange of Units and shares
of Class B Stock shall be deemed to have been effected on (i) the Business Day
after the date on which the Exchange Notice shall have been received by Parent
or the Transfer Agent, as applicable (subject to receipt by Parent or the
Transfer Agent, as applicable, within three (3) Business Days thereafter of
any required instruments of transfer as aforesaid) or (ii) such later date
specified in or pursuant to the Exchange Notice (such date identified in
clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, the "Exchange Date"), and the Person or
Persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of
Class A Stock (which certificates shall bear any legends as may be required in
accordance with applicable Law) shall be issuable upon such exchange as
aforesaid shall be deemed to have become, on the Exchange Date, the holder or
holders of record of the shares represented thereby. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any Member giving notice under Section 10.1(b) may
withdraw or amend such exchange request, in whole or in part, prior to the
effectiveness of the exchange, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Exchange Date (or any such
later time as may be required by applicable Law) by delivery of a written
notice of withdrawal to Parent or the Transfer Agent, specifying (1) the
certificate numbers of the withdrawn Units and shares of Class B Stock, (2) if
any, the number of Units and shares of Class B Stock as to which the Exchange
Notice remains in effect and (3) if the holder so determines, a new Exchange
Date or any other new or revised information permitted in an Exchange Notice.
An Exchange Notice may specify that the exchange is to be contingent
(including as to timing) upon the consummation of a purchase by another Person
(whether in a tender or exchange offer, an underwritten offering or otherwise)
of shares of the Class A Stock into which the Units and shares of Class B
Stock are exchangeable, or contingent (including as to timing) upon the
closing of an announced merger, consolidation or other transaction or event in
which the Class A Stock would be exchanged or converted or become exchangeable
for or convertible into cash or other securities or property or upon the
closing or occurrence of any other event, in which case the exchange shall be
consummated immediately prior to and contingent upon such closing or
occurrence.

  

  

(d) In the event one class or series of Parent Common Stock (the "Existing
Securities") is converted into another class or series of Parent Common Stock
(the "New Securities"), then a Member otherwise entitled to receive Existing
Securities upon exchange shall instead be entitled to receive on exchange the
amount of the New Securities that such Member would have received if the
exchange of Units and shares of Class B Stock had occurred immediately before
the effective date of such event and the Existing Securities received by such
Member had been converted into the New Securities. No adjustments in respect
of dividends or distributions on any Unit will be made on the exchange of any
Unit, but if the Exchange Date with respect to a Unit occurs after the record
date or date of entitlement pursuant to this Agreement for the payment of a
dividend or other distribution on Units but before the date of the payment,
then the registered Member holding the Unit at the close of business on the
record date or such other date of entitlement will be entitled to receive the
dividend or other distribution payable on the Unit on the payment date
(without duplication of any other distribution to which such holder may be
entitled) notwithstanding the exchange of the Unit or the default in payment
of the dividend or distribution due on the Exchange Date

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Parent shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued Equity Securities, solely for the purpose of issuance upon
exchange of Units, such number of shares of Class A Stock that shall be
issuable upon the exchange of all such outstanding Units; provided that
nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude Parent from satisfying
its obligations in respect of the exchange of the Units for shares of Class A
Stock by delivery of purchased shares of Class A Stock which are held in the
treasury of Parent. Parent covenants that all shares of Class A Stock that
shall be issued upon exchange of Units shall, upon issuance thereof, be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free and clear of any lien
or encumbrance (other than those arising under applicable securities laws

  

  

(f) The issuance of Class A Stock upon exchange of Units shall be made without
charge to the exchanging Members for any stamp or other similar tax in respect
of such issuance; provided, however, that if any such shares are to be issued
in a name other than that of the exchanging Member, then the Person or Persons
requesting the issuance thereof shall pay to Parent the amount of any tax that
may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in such issuance or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Manager that such tax has been paid or is
not payable.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.1, but subject
to Section 10.1(h), an exchanging Member may, in lieu of exchanging Units for
Class A Stock, offer to sell all or a portion of such Member's Units and Class
B Stock as described in any particular Exchange Notice for the Cash Amount.
Upon the delivery of an Exchange Notice that includes an offer to sell for the
Cash Amount, the Company shall have the option, exercisable in its sole and
absolute discretion by delivery of a written notice (a "Cash Redemption
Notice"), to elect to purchase for the Cash Amount all or a portion of the
Units so offered. Parent may, it is sole and absolute discretion, deliver
written notice (a "Cash Election Notice") in accordance with, and subject to
the terms of, this Section 10.1(g), to elect to purchase for the Cash Amount
all of such offered Units and shares of Class B Stock described in the
Exchange Notice that the Company has not elected to purchase pursuant to a
Cash Redemption Notice. The Company and/or Parent shall each pay to the
exchanging Member the portion of the Cash Amount (in immediately available
funds) allocable to the Units to be purchased by it, whereupon the Company
and/or Parent shall acquire the Units and Class B Stock offered for exchange
by the exchanging Member and the Company and/or Parent shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of the number of such Units
allocable to the portion of the Cash Amount paid by it. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not have an option to deliver a Cash Redemption
Notice and Parent may not deliver a Cash Election Notice or otherwise elect to
purchase the Units that are the subject of an Exchange Notice for the Cash
Amount without such exchanging Member's consent. Any Class A Stock delivered
to the exchanging Member in connection with such exchange shall comply with
the provisions of Sections 10.1(e) and (f) above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any acquisition by Parent of Units and shares of Class B Stock that
would otherwise be exchanged for shares of Class A Stock in connection with
and sold in a Parent Offer shall be for the same amount and type of
consideration that the Member would have received in such Parent Offer. For
purposes of this Section 10.1, "Cash Amount" means (A) only if the Exchange
Notice for the relevant exchange provides that the exchange is to be
contingent upon the consummation of a purchase by another Person (whether in a
tender or exchange offer, underwritten offering or otherwise) of shares of the
Class A Stock, the amount and type of cash or other property (or combination
of types of property) to which the exchanging Member would be entitled to
receive in such purchase; or (B) otherwise, the amount of cash per share of
Class A Stock equal to the Volume Weighted Average Price of such share of
Class A Stock on the date that the Exchange Notice is delivered to the
Company. Parent may only pay the Cash Amount from (i) proceeds of offerings of
a number of shares of Class A Stock equal to the number of Units covered by
such Exchange Notice or (ii) Distributions under Section 4.1.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a Disposition
Event is approved and consummated in accordance with applicable Law, at the
request of the Company (or following such Disposition Event, its successor) or
Parent (or following such Disposition Event, its successor), each Member shall
be required to exchange with Parent, at any time and from time to time after,
or simultaneously with, the consummation of such Disposition Event, all of
such Member's Units and shares of Class B Stock as provided herein; provided
that, in the event of a Disposition Event intended to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or as a
transfer described in Section 351(a) or Section 721 of the Code the Members
shall not be required to exchange their Units and shares of Class B Stock in
connection with such Disposition Event unless the holders (other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries) of Units are permitted to exchange their Units in a
transaction that is expected to permit such exchange without current
recognition of gain in excess of gain that would be recognized if their Units
had been previously exchanged for Class A stock in a non-taxable transaction,
based on a "should" or "will" level opinion from independent tax counsel of
recognized standing and expertise. For the avoidance of doubt in connection
with a Disposition Event, in no event shall the holders (other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries) of Units be entitled to receive aggregate consideration for
each Unit that is greater or less than the consideration payable in respect of
each share of Class A Stock.

  

  

(i) No exchange pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall impair the right of the
exchanging Member to receive any Distributions payable on the Units so
exchanged in respect of a record date or other date of entitlement pursuant to
this Agreement that occurs prior to the Exchange Date for such exchange. For
the avoidance of doubt, no exchanging Member shall be entitled to receive both
Distributions on Units exchanged by such Member and distributions on Parent
Common Stock received by such Member in such exchange, in respect of a single
record date.

  

  

10.2 Tender Offers and Other Events with Respect to Parent. In the event that
a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid,
recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to Class A Stock (a
"Parent Offer") is proposed by Parent or is proposed to Parent or its
stockholders and approved by the board of directors of Parent or is otherwise
effected or to be effected with the consent or approval of the board of
directors of Parent, the holders (other than Parent) of Units and shares of
Class B Stock shall be permitted to participate in such Parent Offer by
delivery of a contingent Exchange Notice in accordance with the last sentence
of Section 10.1(c). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts expeditiously and in good faith to take all such
actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to enable and
permit the holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of Units and
shares of Class B Stock to participate in such Parent Offer to the same extent
or on an economically equivalent basis as the holders of shares of Class A
Stock without discrimination; provided that, without limiting the generality
of this sentence, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts expeditiously
and in good faith to permit such holders of Units to participate (at their
option) in each such Parent Offer (or, if so required, to cause any exchange
of Units in connection therewith to be effective only upon, and conditioned
upon, the closing of such Parent Offer and, only to the extent necessary, to
require the tender or deposit Units and shares of Class B Stock pursuant to a
Parent Offer in accordance with the last sentence of Section 10.1(c), or, as
applicable, to the extent necessary to exchange the number of Units being
repurchased). Nothing in this Section 10.2 shall affect the ability of the
parties to effect a purchase of Units by Parent as provided in Section
10.1(g), upon the closing of such Parent Offer for the amount per share and
type of cash or other property as is paid for the Class A Stock in a Parent
Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the holders (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries) of Units and shares of Class B Stock be entitled
to receive in such Parent Offer aggregate consideration for each Unit and
corresponding share of Class B Stock that is greater or less than the
consideration payable in respect of each share of Class A Stock in connection
with a Parent Offer.

ADMISSION OF MEMBERS

  

  

11.1 Substituted Members. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE IX hereof, in
connection with the Permitted Transfer of a Unit hereunder, the transferee
shall become a substituted Member ("Substituted Member") on the effective date
of such Transfer, which effective date shall not be earlier than the date of
compliance with the conditions to such Transfer, and such admission shall be
shown on the books and records of the Company.

  

  

11.2 Additional Members. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE IX hereof, a
Person may be admitted to the Company as an additional Member ("Additional
Member") only upon furnishing to the Manager (a) counterparts of this
Agreement and any applicable Other Agreements and (b) such other documents or
instruments as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such
Person's admission as a Member. Such admission shall become effective on the
date on which that such condition has been satisfied.

WITHDRAWAL AND RESIGNATION OF MEMBERS

  

  

12.1 Withdrawal and Resignation of Members. No Member shall have the power or
right to withdraw or otherwise resign as a Member from the Company prior to
the dissolution and winding up of the Company pursuant to this ARTICLE XII.
Any Member, however, that attempts to withdraw or otherwise resign as a Member
from the Company without the prior written consent of the Manager upon or
following the dissolution and winding up of the Company pursuant to this
ARTICLE XII, but prior to such Member receiving the full amount of
Distributions from the Company to which such Member is entitled pursuant to
this ARTICLE XII shall be liable to the Company for all damages (including all
lost profits and special, indirect and consequential damages) directly or
indirectly caused by the withdrawal or resignation of such Member. Upon a
Transfer of all of a Member's Units in a Transfer permitted by this Agreement,
subject to the provisions of Section 9.5, such Member shall cease to be a
Member.

ARTICLE XIII 
 

  

  

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

  

  

13.1 Dissolution. The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of
Additional Members or Substituted Members or the attempted withdrawal or
resignation of a Member. The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be
wound up, upon:

  

  

(a) the unanimous decision of the Members that then hold Units to dissolve the
Company; or

  

  

(b) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under Section
35-5 of the Delaware Act or an administrative dissolution under Section 18-802
of the Delaware Act. Except as otherwise set forth in this ARTICLE XIII, the
Company is intended to have perpetual existence. An Event of Withdrawal shall
not cause a dissolution of the Company and the Company shall continue in
existence subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

13.2 Liquidation and Termination. On dissolution of the Company, the Manager
shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more Persons as liquidator. The
liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of the Company and
make final distributions as provided herein and in the Delaware Act. The costs
of liquidation shall be borne as a Company expense. Until final distribution,
the liquidators shall continue to operate the Company properties with all of
the power and authority of the Manager. The steps to be accomplished by the
liquidators are as follows:

  

  

(a) as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final
liquidation, the liquidators shall cause a proper accounting to be made by a
recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Company's assets,
liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which
the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;

  

  

(b) the liquidators shall cause the notice described in the Delaware Act to be
mailed to each known creditor of and claimant against the Company in the
manner described thereunder;

  

  

(c) the liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from Company funds, or
otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof
(including, without limitation, the establishment of a cash fund for
contingent liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidators may
reasonably determine): first, all expenses incurred in liquidation; and
second, all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members in
accordance with Section 4.1 by the end of the Taxable Year during which the
liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, by ninety (90) days after the
date of the liquidation).

  

  

13.3 Deferment; Distribution in Kind. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 13.2, but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if
upon dissolution of the Company the liquidators determine that an immediate
sale of part or all of the Company's assets would be impractical or would
cause undue loss (or would otherwise not be beneficial) to the Members, the
liquidators may, in their sole discretion, defer for a reasonable time the
liquidation of any assets except those necessary to satisfy Company
liabilities (other than loans to the Company by Members) and reserves. Subject

the provisions of Section 13.2(d), (b) as tenants in common and in accordance

Distributions in kind shall be subject to (a) such conditions relating to the
disposition and management of such assets as the liquidators deem reasonable
and equitable and (b) the terms and conditions of any agreements governing
such assets (or the operation thereof or the holders thereof) at such time.

assets as provided herein, the Company is terminated (and the Company shall
not be terminated prior to such time), and the Manager (or such other Person
or Persons as the Delaware Act may require or permit) shall file a certificate
of cancellation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, cancel any other
filings made pursuant to this Agreement that are or should be canceled and
take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company. The
Company shall be deemed to continue in existence for all purposes of this
Agreement until it is terminated pursuant to this Section 13.4.

  

  

13.5 Reasonable Time for Winding Up. A reasonable time shall be allowed for
the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company and the
liquidation of its assets pursuant to Sections 13.2 and 13.3 in order to
minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

  

  

13.6 Return of Capital. The liquidators shall not be personally liable for the

being understood that any such return shall be made solely from Company
assets).

otherwise authorized separately in writing by the Manager. "Confidential
Information" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, ideas, financial
product structuring, business strategies, innovations and materials, all
aspects of the Company's business plan, proposed operation and products,

proposed partners, software code and system and product designs, employees and
their identities, equity ownership, the methods and means by which the Company
plans to conduct its business, all trade secrets, trademarks, tradenames and

to the Manager and each Member, Confidential Information does not include
information or material that: (a) is rightfully in the possession of the
Manager or such Member at the time of disclosure by the Company; (b) becomes
part of public knowledge, not as a result of any action or inaction of the
Manager or such Member, respectively, in violation of this Agreement; (c) is

party not, to the knowledge of the Manager or such Member, respectively, in

Manager or such Member or their respective representatives without use or
reference to the Confidential Information; or (f) as is required to be
disclosed by order of a Governmental Entity, or by subpoena, summons or legal
process, or by Law (provided that, to the extent permitted by Law, any Member
required to make such disclosure shall provide to the Manager prompt notice of
such disclosure).

  

  

15.2 Amendments. Subject to the following sentence, this Agreement may be
amended or modified only in writing signed by both the Manager and the Members
holding a majority of the Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no
amendment or modification to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
which terms and conditions expressly require the approval or action of certain
Persons (or a requisite number or specified percentage thereof) may be made
without obtaining the consent of the requisite number or specified percentage
of such Persons who are entitled to approve or take action on such matter and
(B) without the consent of each Member affected thereby, no amendment shall:

  

  

(i) modify the limited liability of any Member, or increase the liabilities or
obligations of any Member;

  

  

(ii) alter or change any rights, preferences, privileges, duties, liabilities
or obligations relative to any Units (other than immaterial changes) in a
manner that is different or prejudicial relative to those of any other Units;
or

  

  

(iii) alter or change (A) any rights of holders of Units under Section 10.1 or
Section 10.2, or (B) the terms of Section 3.2, in each case without the prior

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.2, (i) the
Manager, acting alone, may amend this Agreement, including Schedule I, to
reflect the admission of new Members, Transfers of Units and the issuance of
additional Units or Equity Securities, each as provided by the terms of this
Agreement, and, subject to Section 10.1(a), subdivisions or combinations of
Units made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) any
amendment that adversely affects the right, preferences, privileges, duties,
liabilities or obligations of a group or class of the Members relative to any
other Members will require the consent of a majority in interest of the
Members so affected.

  

  

No waiver of any provision or default under, nor consent to any exception to,
the terms of this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby shall be
effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only
to the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.

the Company as an entity, and no Member, individually or collectively, shall
have any ownership interest in such Company assets or any portion thereof. The
Company shall hold title to all of its property in the name of the Company and
not in the name of any Member. All Company assets shall be recorded as the
property of the Company on its books and records, irrespective of the name in
which legal title to such Company assets is held. The Company's credit and
assets shall be used solely for the benefit of the Company, and no asset of
the Company shall be transferred or encumbered for, or in payment of, any
individual obligation of any Member.

15.5 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, executors, administrators,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

  

  

15.6 Creditors. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the
benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, and no creditor who makes a loan to the Company or any of its
Affiliates may have or acquire (except pursuant to the terms of a separate
agreement executed by the Company in favor of such creditor) at any time as a
result of making the loan any direct or indirect interest in Company
Distributions, capital or property other than as a secured creditor.

  

  

15.7 Waiver. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of
any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver
of any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

  

  

15.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which will be an original and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same agreement binding on all the parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

CC-32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

15.9 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Any dispute
relating hereto shall be heard in the state or federal courts of the State of
Delaware, and the parties agree to jurisdiction and venue therein.

  

  

15.10 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any
other jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein.

  

  

15.11 Further Action. The parties shall execute and deliver all documents,
provide all information and take or refrain from taking such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

15.12 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement or
contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of an electronic transmission, including by a
facsimile machine or via email, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of electronic
transmission by a facsimile machine or via email to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through such electronic transmission as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

  

  

15.13 Right of Offset. Whenever the Company is to pay any sum to a Member, any
amounts that such Member owes to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
previously determined pursuant to a final judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction not otherwise subject to appeal may be deducted from that sum
before payment.

  

  

15.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, those documents expressly referred to
herein (including the Equity Transfer and Acquisition Agreement and the other
documents contemplated thereby) embody the complete agreement and
understanding among the parties and supersede and preempt any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written
or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

  

  

15.15 Remedies. Each Member shall have all rights and remedies set forth in
this Agreement and all rights and remedies which such Person has been granted
at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which
such Person has under any law. Any Person having any rights under any
provision of this Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby shall
be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or
other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision
of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law.

pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. The use of the word "including" in
this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than by limitation. Reference
to any agreement, document or instrument means such agreement, document or
instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no amendment or other
modification to any agreement, document or instrument that requires the
consent of any Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other
agreement will be given effect hereunder unless such Person has consented in
writing to such amendment or modification. Wherever required by the context,
references to a Fiscal Year shall refer to a portion thereof. The use of the
words "or," "either" and "any" shall not be exclusive. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(a) Requests for Registration. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the holders of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to direct
that the Company register the sale of all or any portion of their Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act. Short-Form Registrations shall be
unlimited in number, but the Company shall not be obligated to effect more
than two (2) Long-Form Registrations in any eighteen (18) month period.

  

  

(b) Short-Form Registrations. Demand Registrations shall be Short-Form
Registrations whenever the Company is permitted to use any applicable short
form and if the managing underwriters (if any) agree to the use of a Short-
Form Registration. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
Short-Form Registrations available for the sale of Registrable Securities. If
the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities request that a Short-
Form Registration be filed pursuant to Rule 415 (a "Shelf Registration") and
the Company is qualified to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as soon as practicable after filing, and once effective, the
Company shall cause the Shelf Registration to remain effective for a period
ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities
included in such registration have been sold or distributed pursuant to the
Shelf Registration or (ii) the date as of which all of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration are able to be sold without
limitation or restriction within a three (3) month period in compliance with
Rule 144. If thereafter for any reason the Company becomes ineligible to
utilize Form S-3, the Company shall prepare and file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a registration statement or registration statements on
such form that is available for the sale of Registrable Securities.

  

  

(c) Long-Form Registrations. A registration shall not count as a Long-Form
Registration for purposes of the last sentence of Section 2(a) unless (i) at
least 75% of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by the requesting holders have been registered and (ii) such
registration has become effective in accordance with the Securities Act;
provided, that if a Long-Form Registration is withdrawn by the holders of
Registrable Securities who requested such registration prior to the time it
has become effective for reasons other than the disclosure of information
concerning the Company that is materially adverse to the Company or the
trading price of the Class A Common Stock (which disclosure is made by the
Company after the date that such registration is requested pursuant to Section
2(a)), such Long-Form Registration shall count as a Long-Form Registration for
purposes of the last sentence of Section 2(a) unless the holders of
Registrable Securities who requested such registration reimburse the Company
for all of the Registration Expenses incurred by the Company prior to such
withdrawal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Priority on Demand Registrations. If a Demand Registration is an
underwritten offering and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable Securities and other
securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number of
Registrable Securities and other securities, if any, which can be sold therein
without adversely affecting the marketability, proposed offering price, timing
or method of distribution of the offering, the Company shall include in such
registration prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not
Registrable Securities the number of Registrable Securities requested to be
included which, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold, without any
such adverse effect, pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the
basis of the amount of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder.

  

  

(e) Procedures and Restrictions on Demand Registrations. Each request for a
Demand Registration shall specify the approximate number of Registrable
Securities requested to be registered and the intended method of distribution.
Within ten (10) days after receipt of any such request, the Company shall give
written notice of the Demand Registration to all other holders of Registrable
Securities and, subject to the terms of Section 2(d), shall include in such
Demand Registration (and in all related registrations and qualifications under
state blue sky laws and in any related underwriting) all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for
inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Company's
notice. The Company shall not be obligated to effect any Demand Registration,
including any Shelf Registration, if (i) the holders of Registrable
Securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the
public (net of any underwriters' discounts or commissions) of less than
$5,000,000; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not be applicable to
a Demand Registration during the Lock-Up Period to effect the rights of
holders to register the sale of Registrable Securities up to the Lock-Up
Liquidity Amount, or (ii) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
effective date of a previous Demand Registration or a previous registration in
which Registrable Securities were included pursuant to Section 3 in which, in
either case, there was no reduction in the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included. The Company may postpone, for up to ninety (90) days
from the date of the request, the filing or the effectiveness of a
registration statement for a Demand Registration, if the Company's board of
directors determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that not postponing
such Demand Registration (i) would interfere with a material corporate
transaction or (ii) would require the disclosure of material non-public
information concerning the Company that at the time is not, in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Company's board of directors, in the best interest
of the Company to disclose and is not, in the opinion of the Company's legal
counsel, otherwise required to be disclosed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Other Registration Rights. The Company represents and warrants that it is
not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any other agreement, except for the
Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of December 13, 2012, by and among the
Company, Chart Acquisition Group LLC, Cowen Overseas Investment LP and certain
other security holders, granting registration rights to any other Person with
respect to any Class A Common Stock. Except as provided in this Agreement, the
Company shall not grant to any Persons the right to request the Company to
register any Class A Common Stock, or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Class A Common Stock, without the prior
written consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities;
provided, that the Company may grant rights to other Persons to participate in
Piggyback Registrations so long as such rights are subordinate in all respects
to the rights of the holders of Registrable Securities with respect to such
Piggyback Registrations as set forth in Section 3(c) and Section 3(d).

  

  

Section 3. Piggyback Registrations.

  

  

(a) Right to Piggyback. Whenever the Company proposes to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act (other than (i) pursuant to a Demand
Registration, or (ii) in connection with registrations on Form S-4 or S-8
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any successor or
similar forms) and the registration form to be used may be used for the
registration of Registrable Securities (a "Piggyback Registration"), the
Company shall give prompt written notice to all holders of Registrable
Securities of its intention to effect such Piggyback Registration and, subject
to the terms of Section 3(c) and Section 3(d), shall include in such Piggyback
Registration (and in all related registrations or qualifications under blue
sky laws and in any related underwriting) all Registrable Securities with
respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion
therein within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Company's notice.

  

  

(b) Piggyback Expenses. The Registration Expenses of the holders of
Registrable Securities shall be paid by the Company in all Piggyback
Registrations, whether or not any such registration became effective.

  

  

(c) Priority on Primary Registrations. If a Piggyback Registration is an
underwritten primary registration on behalf of the Company, and the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability, proposed offering price, timing or method of distribution of
the offering, the Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the
securities the Company proposes to sell, (ii) second, the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration which, in the opinion
of the underwriters, can be sold without any such adverse effect, pro rata
among the holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the number of
shares owned by each such holder, and (iii) third, other securities requested
to be included in such registration which, in the opinion of the underwriters,
can be sold without any such adverse effect.

  

  

(d) Priority on Secondary Registrations. If a Piggyback Registration is an
underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Company's
Securities (who have registration rights with respect thereto permitted under
the terms of this Agreement), and the managing underwriters advise the Company
in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be
included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering without adversely affecting the marketability, proposed offering
price, timing or method of distribution of the offering, the Company shall
include in such registration (i) first, the securities requested to be
included therein by the holders requesting such registration which, in the
opinion of the underwriters, can be sold without any such adverse effect, (ii)
second, the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration, pro rata among the holders of such Registrable Securities on the
basis of the number of shares owned by each such holder which, in the opinion
of the underwriters, can be sold without any such adverse effect and (iii)
third, other securities requested to be included in such registration which,
in the opinion of the underwriters, can be sold without any such adverse
effect.

dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading
days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the
date hereof, or (2) the date on which the Company consummates a liquidation,
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the
Company's stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A

(x) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge,
encumber, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to

(z) agree or publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction
specified in the foregoing (x) or (y).

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), (w) each holder may transfer
shares of Registrable Securities to a Permitted Transferee thereof prior to
the expiration of the Lock-Up Period if such Permitted Transferee agrees in
writing for the benefit of the Company to be bound by the transfer
restrictions set forth in this Section 4(a), (x) each holder may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, hypothecate, pledge or encumber

Consideration in connection with the consummation of the Equity Transfer (as
each such term is defined in the Equity Transfer and Acquisition Agreement (as
defined in the LLC Agreement), (y) each holder may, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, hypothecate, pledge or encumber Registrable Securities prior
to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, to secure borrowings used to make

Lock-Up Period up to a number of Registrable Securities (in the form of Class
A Common Stock), in aggregate, as is equal to such holder's pro rata portion
of the Lock-Up Liquidity Amount on the basis of the amount of Registrable
Securities owned by each such holder on the date hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Holdback Agreements.

  

  

(i) Holders of Registrable Securities. If requested by the Company, each
holder of Registrable Securities participating in an underwritten Public
Offering shall enter into lock-up agreements or arrangements with the managing
underwriter(s) of such Public Offering (in addition to the arrangement set
forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in such form as is reasonably requested by such
managing underwriter(s). In addition to any such lock-up agreement or
arrangement with the managing underwriter(s), each holder of Registrable
Securities agrees as follows:

  

  

(A) In connection with any underwritten Public Offering and without the prior
written consent of the underwriters managing such Public Offering, such holder
shall not, for a period ending one hundred eighty (180) days following the
date of the final prospectus (the "Holdback Period") relating to such Public
Offering, (x) offer, hypothecate, pledge, encumber sell, contract, sell any

arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of owning Class A Common Stock or other securities of

is to be settled by delivery of Class A Common Stock or such other securities,
in cash or otherwise (each such transaction, a "Sale Transaction").

  

  

(B) The foregoing clause (i)(A) shall not apply to (w) transactions relating

provisions substantially the same as the lock-up provisions agreed to by such
holder and (2) no such transfer or distribution in (x), (y), or (z) shall be
permitted if it shall require a filing under Section 16(a) or Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act, reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of
Class A Common Stock, and no such filing under Section 16(a) or Section 13(d)

EE-7

this Agreement (other than in a Public Offering) and (y) each of its directors
and executive officers, to agree not to effect any Sale Transaction during any
Holdback Period, except as part of such underwritten registration, if
otherwise permitted, unless the underwriters managing the Public Offering
otherwise agree in writing.

  

  

(iii) The foregoing limitations of this Section 4 shall not apply to a

subject to the provisions of Section 11 hereof applicable to the Transfer of
Registrable Securities), neither this Section 4, nor any other provision of
this Agreement shall restrict or limit the right or ability of any Investor or
Permitted Transferee under the LLC Agreement to effect a Transfer of Units
(and Class B Stock), including, but not limited to, an exchange of Units (and
Class B Stock) for Class A Stock (as such terms are defined in the LLC
Agreement) as and to the extent permitted under the terms and provisions of
the LLC Agreement.

as possible:

(iii) prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration

such registration statement have been disposed of in accordance with the
intended methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such
registration statement (but in any event not before the expiration of any
longer period required under the Securities Act or, if such registration
statement relates to an underwritten Public Offering, such longer period as in
the opinion of counsel for the underwriters a prospectus is required by law to
be delivered in connection with sale of Registrable Securities by an
underwriter or dealer) and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration
statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement;

  

  

(iv) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities thereunder such number
of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement

disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller;

  

  

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable

consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities
owned by such seller; provided, that the Company shall not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph or (B) consent to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) notify each seller of such Registrable Securities (A) promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the date and time when such registration statement
and each post-effective amendment thereto has become effective or a prospectus
or supplement to any prospectus relating to a registration statement has been
filed and when any registration or qualification has become effective under a
state securities or blue sky law or any exemption thereunder has been
obtained; (B) promptly after receipt thereof, of any request by the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the amendment or supplementing of such
registration statement or prospectus or for additional information and (C) at
any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, the
Company shall prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
provided, that at any time, upon written notice to the participating holders
of Registrable Securities, the Company may delay the filing or effectiveness
of any registration statement or suspend the use or effectiveness of any
registration statement (the "Suspension Period") (and the holders of
Registrable Securities hereby agree not to offer or sell any Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement during the Suspension
Period) if the Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that
postponement of such registration would be in the best interest of the Company
including where the registration might require disclosure of any matter such
as a potential business transaction or other matter; provided, that the
Company may only exercise its right to institute a Suspension Period twice in
any calendar year and for no more than one hundred twenty (120) days in the
aggregate in any calendar year;

  

  

(vii) use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to
be listed on any securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed;

  

  

(viii) use reasonable best efforts to provide a transfer agent and registrar
for all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such
registration statement;

  

  

(ix) enter into and perform a customary underwriting agreement, if applicable;

  

  

(x) make available for inspection by any seller of Registrable Securities, any

statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such
seller or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
and business documents and properties of the Company as shall be necessary to
enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the
Company's officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and
independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with
such registration statement;

  

  

(xi) take all reasonable actions to ensure that any Free-Writing Prospectus
utilized in connection with any registration hereunder complies in all
material respects with the Securities Act, is filed in accordance with the
Securities Act to the extent required thereby, is retained in accordance with
the Securities Act to the extent required thereby and, when taken together
with the related prospectus, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(xii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12) months
beginning with the first day of the Company's first full calendar quarter
after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings
statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
and Rule 158;

  

  

(xiii) permit any holder of Registrable Securities to participate in the
preparation of such registration or comparable statement and to allow such
holder to propose language for insertion therein, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Company, which in the reasonable judgment of such holder
and its counsel should be included;

  

  

(xiv) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement, or the issuance of any order
suspending or preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending the
qualification of any Registrable Securities included in such registration
statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use reasonable best efforts promptly
to obtain the withdrawal of such order;

  

  

(xv) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by
such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable
the sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

  

  

(xvi) cooperate with the holders of Registrable Securities covered by the
registration statement and the managing underwriter or agent, if any, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing
any restrictive legends) representing securities to be sold under the
registration statement and enable such securities to be in such denominations
and registered in such names as the managing underwriter, or agent, if any, or
such holders may request;

  

  

(xvii) cooperate with each holder of Registrable Securities covered by the
registration statement and each underwriter or agent, if any, participating in
the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in
connection with any filings required to be made with FINRA;

  

  

(xviii) use its reasonable best efforts to make available the executive
officers of the Company to participate with the holders of Registrable
Securities and any underwriters in any "road shows" or other selling efforts
that may be reasonably requested by the holders in connection with the methods
of distribution for the Registrable Securities;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(xix) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more cold comfort
letters from the Company's independent public accountants in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by cold comfort
letters; and

  

  

(xx) use its reasonable best efforts to provide a legal opinion of the

  

  

Company's outside counsel in customary form and covering such matters of the
type customarily covered by such legal opinion, dated the effective date of
such registration statement.

  

  

(b) The Company shall not undertake any voluntary act that could be reasonably
expected to cause a Violation or result in delay or suspension under Section
5(a)(vi). During any Suspension Period, and as may be extended hereunder, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to correct or update any
disclosure causing the Company to provide notice of the Suspension Period and
to file and cause to become effective or terminate the suspension of use or
effectiveness, as the case may be, the subject registration statement. In the
event that the Company shall exercise its right to delay or suspend the filing
or effectiveness of a registration hereunder, the applicable time period
during which the registration statement is to remain effective shall be
extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period.
The Company may extend the Suspension Period for an additional consecutive
sixty (60) days with the consent of the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities registered under the applicable registration statement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If so directed by the
Company, all holders of Registrable Securities registering shares under such
registration statement shall (i) not offer to sell any Registrable Securities
pursuant to the registration statement during the period in which the delay or
suspension is in effect after receiving notice of such delay or suspension and
(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the
Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
holders' possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice.

  

  

Section 6. Registration Expenses.

  

  

(a) The Company's Obligation. All expenses incident to the Company's
performance of or compliance with this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all registration, qualification and filing fees, fees and expenses
of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, printing expenses, messenger
and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians, and fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and all independent certified public
accountants, underwriters (excluding underwriting discounts and commissions)
and other Persons retained by the Company) (all such expenses being herein
called "Registration Expenses"), shall be borne by the Company except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing the Company shall, in any event, pay its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of
any annual audit or quarterly review and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed. Each Person that sells
securities pursuant to a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration
hereunder shall bear and pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, if
any, applicable to the securities sold for such Person's account.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Counsel Fees and Disbursements. In connection with each Demand
Registration and each Piggyback Registration, the Company shall reimburse the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration for the
reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel chosen by the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities included in such registration.

  

  

(c) Security Holders. To the extent any Registration Expenses are to be borne
by the holders of Registrable Securities and not the Company under the terms
of this Agreement, each holder of securities included in any registration
hereunder shall pay those Registration Expenses allocable to the registration
of such holder's securities so included, and any Registration Expenses not so
allocable shall be borne by all sellers of securities included in such
registration (including the Company, as applicable) in proportion to the
aggregate selling price of the securities to be so registered.

  

  

Section 7. Indemnification and Contribution.

  

  

(a) By the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Securities, such holder's
officers, directors employees, agents and representatives, and each Person who
controls such holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, actions, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including with respect to actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, and including reasonable attorney fees and
expenses) caused by, resulting from, arising out of, based upon or related to
any of the following statements, omissions or violations (each a "Violation")
by the Company: (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in (a) any registration statement, prospectus, preliminary
prospectus or Free-Writing Prospectus, or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or (b) any application or other document or communication (in this
Section 7, collectively called an "application") executed by or on behalf of
the Company or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify any securities covered
by such registration under the securities laws thereof; (ii) any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any violation or
alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any other similar
federal or state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction
required of the Company in connection with any such registration,
qualification or compliance. In addition, the Company will reimburse such
Indemnified Party for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be liable in any such
case to the extent that any such losses result from, arise out of, are based
upon, or relate to an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
omission or alleged omission, made in such registration statement, any such
prospectus, preliminary prospectus or Free-Writing Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in
conformity with, written information prepared and furnished in writing to the
Company by an Indemnified Party expressly for use therein or by an Indemnified
Party's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto after the Company has furnished such
Indemnified Party with a sufficient number of copies of the same.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) By Each Security Holder. In connection with any registration statement in
which a holder of Registrable Securities is participating, each such holder
shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the
Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration
statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify
the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting
from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the
registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by or on behalf of such holder; provided, that the
obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each
holder and shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds (before taxes)
received by such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such registration statement.

  

  

(c) Claim Procedure. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
(i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with
respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided, that the failure to give
prompt notice shall impair any Person's right to indemnification hereunder
only to the extent such failure has prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified
party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any
other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. In such
instance, the conflicted indemnified parties shall collectively have a right
to retain one separate counsel, chosen by the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities of the conflicted indemnified parties, at the expense
of the indemnifying party.

  

  

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to, or is
insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party or is otherwise
unenforceable with respect to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action
referred to herein, then the indemnifying party in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party hereunder shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the
other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations; provided, that the maximum amount of liability in
respect of such contribution shall be limited, in the case of each seller of
Registrable Securities, to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually
received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities effected
pursuant to such registration. The relative fault of the indemnifying party
and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
or equitable if the contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
does not take into account such equitable considerations. The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses referred to herein shall be deemed to include any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which
is the subject hereof. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Release. No indemnifying party shall, except with the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 7, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for
any amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability, or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the indemnifying
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(f) Non-exclusive Remedy; Survival. The indemnification and contribution
provided for under this Agreement shall be in addition to any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any indemnified party may have pursuant
to law or contract and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer,
director or controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of Registrable Securities and the termination or expiration of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in
conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall control.

  

  

Section 8. Underwritten Registrations.

  

  

(a) Selection of Underwriters. The Company shall determine whether the
offering pursuant to any registration under this Agreement is underwritten. In
any Piggyback Registration, the Company shall have the right to select the
investment banker(s) and manager(s) of the offering in its sole discretion
and, in any Demand Registration, the Company shall have the right to select
the investment banker(s) and manager(s) of the offering subject to the consent
of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be included in
such offering, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

(b) Participation. No Person may participate in any registration hereunder
which is underwritten unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements
(including, without limitation, pursuant to any over-allotment or "green shoe"
option requested by the underwriters; provided, that no holder of Registrable
Securities shall be required to sell more than the number of Registrable
Securities such holder has requested to include) and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Suspended Distributions. Each Person that is participating in any
registration under this Agreement, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(a)(vi)(C),
shall immediately discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to the registration statement until such Person's receipt of the
copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by Section
5(a)(vi)(C). In the event the Company has given any such notice, the time
period during which a Registration Statement is to remain effective shall be
extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date
of the giving of such notice pursuant to this Section 8(c) to and including
the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus.

  

  

Section 9. Additional Investors. The Company may require or permit any Person
who acquires Class A Common Stock or rights to acquire Class A Common Stock
from the Company after the date hereof to become a party to this Agreement by
obtaining an executed Joinder from such Person (each, an "Additional
Investor"). Upon the execution and delivery of a Joinder by an Additional
Investor, the Class A Common Stock so acquired by or issuable to such Person
(the "Specified Common") shall be Registrable Securities.

  

  

Section 10. Current Public Information. At all times after the Company has
filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the requirements of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
the Company shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall take such further action as any
holder or holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the
extent required to enable such holders to sell Registrable Securities pursuant
to Rule 144. Upon request, the Company shall deliver to any holder of
Restricted Securities a written statement as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

  

  

Section 11. Transfer of Registrable Securities.

  

  

(a) Restrictions on Transfers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except in the case of (i) a transfer to the Company, (ii) a
transfer by an Investor to one of its Permitted Transferees, (iii) a Public
Offering, or (iv) a sale pursuant to Rule 144, prior to transferring any
Registrable Securities to any Person (including, without limitation, by
operation of law), the transferring Investor shall cause the prospective
transferee to execute and deliver to the Company a Joinder agreeing to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement. Any transfer or attempted transfer of
any Registrable Securities in violation of any provision of this Agreement
shall be void, and the Company shall not record such transfer on its books or
treat any purported transferee of such Registrable Securities as the owner
thereof for any purpose.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Legend. Each certificate evidencing any Registrable Securities and each
certificate issued in exchange for or upon the transfer of any Registrable
Securities (unless such Registrable Securities would no longer be Registrable
Securities after such transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form:

  

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON
TRANSFER AND OTHER PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT
DATED AS OF _________ AMONG THE ISSUER OF SUCH SECURITIES (THE "COMPANY") AND
CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS, AS AMENDED. A COPY OF SUCH REGISTRATION
RIGHTS AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE COMPANY TO THE HOLDER
HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST."

  

  

The Company shall imprint such legend on certificates evidencing Registrable
Securities outstanding prior to the date hereof. The legend set forth above
shall be removed from the certificates evidencing any securities that have
ceased to be Registrable Securities.

  

  

Section 12. General Provisions.

  

  

(a) Termination. Except with respect to the indemnification and contribution
provisions contained in Section 7, the rights granted to an Investor (or a
Permitted Transferee) pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate and forthwith
become null and void in full on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which
such Investor (or Permitted Transferee) ceases to beneficially own any
Registrable Securities and (ii) the later of (x) the seventh anniversary of
the date of this Agreement, and (y) the date Rule 144 or another similar
exemption under the Securities Act is available for the sale of all of the
shares beneficially owned by such Investor (or Permitted Transferee) without
limitation and restriction during a three (3) month period without
registration.

  

  

(b) Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
provisions of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only with the
prior written consent of the Company and holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities. The failure or delay of any Person to enforce any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of
such provisions and shall not affect the right of such Person thereafter to
enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms. A waiver or consent to or of any breach or default by any Person in the
performance by that Person of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or
default in the performance by that Person of the same or any other obligations
of that Person under this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Remedies. The parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce their
rights under this Agreement specifically (without posting a bond or other
security), to recover damages caused by reason of any breach of any provision
of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in their favor.
The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that a breach of this Agreement would
cause irreparable harm and money damages would not be an adequate remedy for
any such breach and that, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing hereunder, any party shall be entitled to specific performance and/or
other injunctive relief from any court of law or equity of competent
jurisdiction (without posting any bond or other security) in order to enforce
or prevent violation of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EE-17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited, invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or regulation
in any jurisdiction, such prohibition, invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or in any other
jurisdiction, but this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in
such jurisdiction as if such prohibited, invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein.

  

  

(e) Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement
contains the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and preempts any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof
in any way.

  

  

(f) Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit and be enforceable by the
Company and its successors and assigns and the holders of Registrable
Securities and their respective successors and permitted assigns (whether so
expressed or not). In addition, whether or not any express assignment has been
made, the provisions of this Agreement which are for the benefit of purchasers
or holders of Registrable Securities are also for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, any subsequent holder of Registrable Securities.

  

  

(g) Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to be given under or
by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been given (i) when delivered personally to the recipient; (ii)
when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal
business hours of the recipient but, if not, then on the next business day;
