adjustment to the Seller financial statements which would, if implemented, materially and adversely affect the Business Financial Statements. All of the Liabilities reflected on the Business Balance Sheet are related to the Business and arose out of
or were incurred in the ordinary course of business. Except as set forth on <U>Schedule 2.7</U>, Seller does not have and will not have any obligation or liability relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due and regardless of when or by whom asserted) arising out of any transaction entered at or prior to the date hereof, or any action or inaction at or prior to the date hereof, or any
