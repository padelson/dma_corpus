ALL WARRANTIES PERTAINING THERETO, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

1.2 Purchase Price and Payment Terms.

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets and the rights
granted to the Licensed Assets in Section 1.1(b) (the "Cash Purchase Price")
is $200,000,000 _adjusted_ by the amount (if any) by which the Businesss
Working Capital as shown on the Closing Statement (the "Closing Working
Capital") is more or less than $28,000,000 (not more than $20,000,000 of which
will be cash at Buyers election not less than 10 days prior to the Closing).
"Working Capital" means the net book value as of the Closing Date of (i) cash
plus Accounts Receivable (as such term is defined in _Exhibit B_ ) minus (ii)
the Accounts Payable. Working Capital shall be calculated in the manner set
forth on _Schedule 1.2(a)_.

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall purchase from Seller the Purchased Assets and
the rights to the Licensed Assets described in Section 1.1(b), and shall
assume the Assumed Liabilities.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller $200,000,000 in immediately
available funds.

(d) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement (in its final and binding form as determined below, the
"Closing Statement") setting forth the Closing Working Capital as of the
close of business on the day before the Closing Date. The Closing Statement
shall include all known adjustments required in a year-end closing of the
books and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Seller shall cooperate as
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Statement. During the 30-day period immediately following Sellers receipt of
the Closing Statement, Seller shall be permitted to review Buyers working
papers related to the preparation of the Closing Statement and determination
of the Closing Working Capital. The Closing Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt thereof,
unless Seller shall give written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of
Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement
so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then
the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below)
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earliest of (x) the
date the parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date all
matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
During the  



 

4  twenty (20) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and
Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. Following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and its
agents and representatives shall be permitted to review Sellers and its
representatives working papers relating to the Notice of Disagreement. If,
at the end of the 20-day period referred to above, the matters in dispute have
not been fully resolved, then the parties shall submit to a mutually agreed
upon independent accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") for review and
resolution of all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute, and
the Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of the Closing Working
Capital to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. The parties will
cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. In
resolving any matters in dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value
to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned
by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on
the other hand. The Accounting Firms determination will be based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review). The Closing Statement and the determination of the
Closing Working Capital shall become final and binding on the parties on the
date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the
parties (which the Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver not more
than forty-five (45) days following submission of such disputed matters). The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shall be paid by the party
determined by the Accounting Firm to be the non-prevailing party in
connection with the dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Accounting
Firm shall determine in its reasonable discretion that neither party shall be
the non-prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be borne 50%
by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer.

(e) If $200,000,000 is greater than the Cash Purchase Price, Seller shall,
within three (3) business days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer to Buyer, in immediately
available funds the amount of such difference.

(f) If the Cash Purchase Price is greater than $200,000,000, Buyer shall,
within three (3) business days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer to Seller, in
immediately available funds the amount of such difference.

1.3 Sales, Use and Transfer Taxes. To the extent that the Transfer Taxes do
not exceed $1,000,000, Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for one half
of any sale or use, transfer, value added, real property gains, excise, stamp
or other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") imposed by reason of the transfer of
the Purchased Assets, the license rights granted in Section 1.1(b) and the
Assumed Liabilities provided hereunder and any deficiency, interest or
penalty asserted with respect thereto. The party which is obligated by law to
remit the Transfer Tax to the applicable governmental agency shall pay the
entire Transfer Tax when due, and shall be reimbursed one-half of the Transfer
Tax using the reimbursement procedures set forth in Section 4.7(f). Buyer and
Seller agree to cooperate to the extent legally permitted to minimize any
transfer taxes arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation by Buyer accepting delivery of
software assets located in the State  



 

5  of California by electronic transmission from Sellers place of business to
Buyers computers in accordance with California Sales and Use Tax Regulation
1502(f)(1)(D), with Seller having no obligation to deliver any tangible assets
in connection with the delivery of such software. To the extent that the
Transfer Taxes exceed $1,000,000 (such amount, the "Excess Transfer Taxes"),
Seller shall be responsible for paying, shall promptly discharge when due, and
shall reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from, any such Excess
Transfer Taxes imposed by reason of the transfer of the Purchased Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities provided hereunder and any deficiency, interest
or penalty asserted with respect thereto.

1.4 Transfer of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities. The Purchased
Assets shall be sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, and the
Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed, pursuant to transfer and assumption
agreements, deeds, endorsements, consents or other instruments in such form
as is necessary to effect a conveyance of good right, title and interest in,
to and under the Purchased Assets and an assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
in the jurisdictions in which such transfers are to be made, and which shall
be satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller, to be executed and delivered
(upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof) on the Closing Date by
the Seller and/or its applicable subsidiaries and the Buyer. 

1.5 Procedures for Assets and Contracts Not Transferable. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the
sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery or attempted sale,
conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery to the Buyer of any Purchased
Asset is prohibited by applicable law or would require any governmental or
third-party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers (collectively,
"Consents") or would constitute a breach or would in any way adversely affect
the rights of the Buyer to any Purchased Asset, each of the Seller and the
Buyer shall use its, and shall cause its subsidiaries and Affiliates to use
their respective, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents
prior to the Closing and if any such Consents shall not have been obtained
prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
sell, convey, transfer, assign or deliver (or a sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment or delivery of) such Purchased Asset if any of the foregoing would
constitute a breach of applicable Law or the rights of any third party;
provided, however, that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Closing shall occur
notwithstanding the foregoing on the terms set forth herein; and provided
further, however, that the Seller shall not be relieved of its obligation to
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, and the Buyer of its obligation to
purchase, such Purchased Assets. Following the Closing, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with each other to
obtain promptly such Consents. If such Consent is obtained, Seller shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries and Affiliates to, promptly convey, transfer,
assign and deliver, or cause to be conveyed, transferred, assigned and
delivered, such Purchased Asset to the Buyer. The provisions of this Section
1.5 shall not in any way limit the Buyers rights under this Agreement in the
event that the conditions to Closing are not satisfied.

1.6 Payments Post-Closing. If, following the Closing Date, the Seller or any
of its subsidiaries receives any payment or other proceeds (including the
benefit of a mistaken payment) (i) relating to any Purchased Assets, or (ii)
otherwise relating to the conduct or operation of the Business after the
Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, promptly
remit to the Buyer the amount of any such payments to the extent relating to
the Purchased Assets.

representations and warranties as if made hereunder, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date. The Disclosure Schedule exceptions shall
be arranged according to specific sections in this Article II and shall
provide exceptions to, or otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, only
the corresponding section in this Article II and any other section in this
Article II where it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure would

conducted and to sell and convey the Purchased Assets to Buyer. With respect
to the Business, Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign company in each of the jurisdictions in
which Seller currently operates, and there are no other jurisdictions in which
the conduct of its business or the ownership or lease of its assets requires
such qualification under applicable law.

2.2 Authorization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
agreement, instrument, certificate and document being or to be executed and
delivered by a Party pursuant to this Agreement (each a "Transaction
Agreement") by Seller and the performance of all obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been duly authorized and no other action or approval is
necessary for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and
each Transaction Agreement by Seller. Seller has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, each Transaction
Agreement and such other agreements and instruments as are contemplated

approvals as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Transaction

otherwise complete the transactions contemplated hereunder, or (ii) materially
affect the Business or the Buyers ability  



 

7  to conduct the Business following the Closing, conflict with or result in a
breach by Seller, or constitute default by Seller under, or create an event
that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would be a

license agreement, or any other material Contract to which any of the

Entity") to which any of the Purchased Assets are subject;

(b) result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, mortgage,
pledge, security interest, charge or encumbrance of any kind, whether
voluntary or involuntary, (including any conditional sale or other title
retention agreement, any lease in the nature thereof, and any agreement to
give any security interest) (collectively, an "Encumbrance") upon the
Purchased Assets;

making necessary filings and giving required notices, violate any provision
of applicable law relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets (other than
such conflicts, violations or breaches which would not, in any material
respect, adversely affect (i) the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements, or (ii) Sellers ability to
convey the Purchased Assets free and clear of any claims or Encumbrances or
otherwise complete the transactions contemplated hereunder). As used in this
Agreement, any reference to any fact, circumstance, event, effect or change

fact, circumstance, event, effect or change that is materially adverse to the
Business, or when used in reference to a party, the business or financial
condition of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall not
include events or effects relating to or resulting from (A) changes in
general economic or political conditions on the securities, credit or
financial markets to the extent such changes do not have a materially
disproportionate impact on the Business or such party and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (B) changes or developments in the industries in which the
Business operates to the extent such changes or developments do not
disproportionately impact the Business; (C) changes in law to the extent such

revenue or earning predictions for any period (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not the underlying facts and circumstances).



  

8 2.4 Judgments; Litigation. There is no (a) outstanding judgment, order,
decree, award, stipulation or injunction of any Governmental Entity against
Seller, the Purchased Assets or the Business which seeks to or is reasonably
likely to have the effect of preventing Seller from conveying the Purchased
Assets, or (b) action, suit, arbitration, hearing, inquiry, proceeding,
complaint, charge or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative
("Action"), by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator or any appeal
from any of the foregoing pending against Seller, the Purchased Assets or the
Business which, if resolved adversely to Seller would be reasonably likely to
impair Sellers ability to convey the Purchased Assets or materially adversely
affect the Business.

2.5 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights.

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean all
worldwide (i) patents (including but not limited to continuations,
continuations-in-part, divisionals, renewals, reissues, and extensions
thereof) and inventions or discoveries (whether patentable or not and whether
reduced to practice or not), (ii) works of authorship and any copyrights
therein (including but not limited to databases and computer software,
records and data, and all media on which any of the foregoing is recorded),
(iii) trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, URLs, logos, trade
names and trade dress, brand names and other source indicators, and all
goodwill related thereto, (iv) trade secrets and confidential information
(including confidential ideas, research and development, know-how, formulas,
compositions, manufacturing and production processes and techniques, technical
data, designs, drawings, specifications, customer, sales prospect and
supplier lists, pricing and cost information, and marketing plans and
proposals), (v) all other intellectual property rights under any laws or
international conventions throughout the world, and (vi) any registrations
and applications for registration of any of the foregoing, including all
renewals, reissues and extensions thereof.

(b) Except as described in _Schedule 2.5(b)_ , to the Sellers knowledge,
Seller either has the exclusive right, title and interest in, or a valid and
binding right under an Assumed Contract to use, all Intellectual Property
used in the Business as currently conducted (collectively, the "Seller
Intellectual Property"). Other than with respect to patents, the Licensed
Assets, the Purchased Intellectual Property (as defined in  _Exhibit B_ ) and
the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to an Assumed Contract constitutes
all of the Intellectual Property necessary to operate the Business in the
manner currently conducted. To the Sellers knowledge, the patents necessary
to use the Licensed Assets, the patents constituting the Purchased
Intellectual Property and the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to an
Assumed Contract together constitute all of the patents necessary to operate
the Business in the manner currently conducted. _Schedule 2.5(b)_ contains,
to the extent included in the Purchased Assets and the Licensed Assets, an
accurate (i) description of all patents, registered trademarks, registered
trade names, registered Internet domain names and registered copyrights and
all applications and registration statements therefor, (any such registered
intellectual property rights being referred to herein as "Registered Seller
Proprietary Rights") including the jurisdictions in which each such
Registered Seller Proprietary Right has been issued or registered or in which
any application for such issuance or registration has been filed and the
applicable registration or  



 

9  application numbers and dates, used in the operation of the Business, and
(ii) list of all material licenses and other material agreements with
third parties related to third party Intellectual Property used in the
operation of the Business (the "Third Party Licenses"), other than
commercially available off-the-shelf software licenses or non-exclusive
customer agreements entered into in the ordinary course of the Business,
indicating for each such Third Party License if it is not also an Assumed
Contract (as defined in _Exhibit B_ ). All registrations with Governmental
Entities in respect of Registered Seller Proprietary Rights other than issued
patents and, to the Sellers knowledge, issued patents are valid and in full
force and effect. Seller is not in default (or with the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both, would be in default) in any material respect under any
Contract involving Intellectual Property used in the Business, nor, to
Sellers knowledge, is any counterparty thereto. To the Sellers knowledge,
the Intellectual Property of the Business is not being infringed or
misappropriated by any other Person. No cancellation, termination, expiration
or abandonment of any of the registrations and applications in respect of
Registered Seller Proprietary Rights (except natural expiration or termination
at the end of the full possible term) is anticipated by Seller and Seller is
not aware of any questions or challenges with respect to the patentability,
validity of any claims of, or enforceability of any such registrations and
applications. Seller has not received written notice that Seller is
infringing or misappropriating any Intellectual Property of any other Person,
and to Sellers knowledge no claim is pending or has been made or asserted to
such effect that has not been resolved. 

(c) Seller has taken reasonable steps to protect and preserve the
confidentiality of all Seller Intellectual Property not otherwise disclosed
in published patents or patent applications or registered copyrights ("Seller
Confidential Information"). Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.5(c)_, all use
by and disclosure to employees or others of Seller Confidential Information
has been pursuant to the terms of valid and binding written confidentiality
and nonuse/restricted-use agreements or agreements that contain similar
obligations.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.5(d)_, each current and former
employee and contractor of Seller who is or was involved in, or who has
contributed to, the creation or development of any Seller Intellectual
Property has executed and delivered (and to the Sellers knowledge, is in
compliance with) an agreement which provides a valid written assignment to
Seller of all title and rights to all Seller Intellectual Property. No third
party has "moral rights" or rights to terminate any assignment or license with
respect thereto.

(e) To the Sellers knowledge, all Software is free of all viruses, worms,
trojan horses and other infections or harmful routines. Seller uses

10  materials covered thereby in any manner or (B) challenging the ownership,
validity or enforceability of any Seller Intellectual Property. No
Seller Intellectual Property owned by Seller and, to the knowledge of Seller,
no material in-licensed Intellectual Property that is incorporated into
products or services of the Business ("In-Licensed IP") is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement related to or
restricting in any manner the licensing, assignment, transfer, use or
conveyance thereof by the Seller or any of its subsidiaries.

any of its subsidiaries has brought any actions or lawsuits alleging (A)
infringement or misappropriation of any of the Seller Intellectual Property or
(B) breach of any license, sublicense or other agreement authorizing another
party to use any Seller Intellectual Property, and, to the knowledge of the
Seller, there does not exist any facts which could currently form the basis of
any such action or lawsuit. Neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries has
entered into any agreement granting any third party the right to bring
infringement or misappropriation actions with respect to, or otherwise to
enforce rights with respect to, any of the Seller Intellectual Property.

(h) To the extent that any Seller Intellectual Property has been developed or
created independently or jointly by an independent contractor or other third
party for the Seller or any of its subsidiaries, the Seller or one of its
subsidiaries has a written agreement with such independent contractor or third
party and has thereby obtained ownership of, and is the exclusive owner of all
such independent contractors or third partys Intellectual Property in such

its subsidiaries to license, assign or otherwise grant rights to additions,
modifications or improvements to material In-Licensed IP made by or for the
Seller or any of its subsidiaries back to the licensor of any Third Party
License; and (D) all licenses and other agreements entered into during the
five (5) year period prior to the Closing pursuant to which a third party has
been granted, with respect to Purchased Intellectual Property, rights to
access, possess or use source code. The Seller has delivered or
made available to the Buyer copies of all licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements listed on _Schedule 2.5(i)_. The Seller and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with all material terms and conditions of all such licenses,
sublicenses, and other agreements, except where the failure to comply would
not have a material adverse effect.

(j) No Software covered by or embodying any Seller Intellectual Property or
Product has been or is being distributed, in whole or in part, or was used, or
is being used in conjunction with any Public Software in a manner which would
require that such software or Product (excluding the original Public
Software) be disclosed or distributed in source code form or made available at
no charge. "Public Software" means any software that contains, or is derived
in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software that is distributed as
free software, open source software (e.g., Linux) or similar licensing or
distribution models.



 

11 (k) To the knowledge of Seller, the operation of the Business does not
infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any third party,
violate any right of any third party (including any right to privacy or
publicity), or constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws
of any jurisdiction, nor has Seller received notice from a third party
alleging any of the foregoing with regard to the Business.

(l) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
neither violate nor result in a breach, modification, cancellation,
termination, suspension of any material Contracts relating to Seller
Intellectual Property or relating to In-Licensed IP; or any acceleration of
or increase in, or loss of, any payments or benefits thereunder.

2.7 Financial Statements; Absence of Liabilities. As of the Closing,
_Schedule 2.7_ of the Disclosure Schedule shall contain a true and complete
copy of the unaudited balance sheet for the Business and the related unaudited
consolidated statement of income for the Business as of and for the twelve
month period ended December 31, 2007 (collectively, the "Business Financial
Statements"). The unaudited December 31, 2007 balance sheet is referred to
herein as the "Business Balance Sheet." The Business Financial Statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition and results
of operations of the Business, and the income statement fairly presents the
income of the Purchased Assets, as of their respective dates and for the
respective periods indicated therein. The Business Financial Statements were
prepared in good faith and derived from the Sellers financial statements. The
Seller is not aware of, is not contemplating, nor has it been notified, in
writing or orally, by its auditors or by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") of any fact or circumstance, or proposed or potential
adjustment, that might require an adjustment to the Seller financial
statements which would, if implemented, materially and adversely affect the
Business Financial Statements. All of the Liabilities reflected on the
Business Balance Sheet are related to the Business and arose out of or were
incurred in the ordinary course of business. Except as set forth on _Schedule
2.7_ , Seller does not have and will not have any obligation or liability
relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due
and regardless of when or by whom asserted) arising out of any transaction
entered at or prior to the date hereof, or any action or inaction at or prior
to the date hereof, or any state of facts existing at or prior to the date
hereof, other than (a) liabilities reflected on the Business Financial
Statements, (b) liabilities and obligations which have arisen after the date
of the Business Financial Statements in the ordinary course of business (none
of which is a liability for breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort,
infringement, violation of law, claim or lawsuit),  



 

13  (c) obligations under contracts and commitments described on _Schedule 2.20_
or under contracts and commitments entered into in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice which are not required to be
disclosed on such Schedule pursuant to Section 2.20 below (but not liabilities
for any breach of any such contract or commitment occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date), and (d) other liabilities and obligations expressly disclosed
in the other Schedules referred to in this Article II.

2.8 Changes. Since January 1, 2007, except as contemplated by or as disclosed
in this Agreement, Seller has conducted the Business only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such date, (a)
there has not been any material adverse change in the Business or its
financial results, (b) Seller has not taken or committed to take any of the
actions specified in Section 4.3 and (c) Seller has continued to provide the
business with all financial and operational support necessary to continue to
operate in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice.

2.9 Assumed Contracts. Each Assumed Contract that is currently in effect and
material to the Business (materiality for the purpose of this sentence being
determined based on the Business as of December 31, 2007) (i) is in full
force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and to the Sellers
knowledge, of each other party thereto, (ii) upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall continue in full force
and effect without penalty or other adverse consequence subject to the need to
obtain the consents and approvals set forth in _Schedule 2.3_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) neither Seller nor, to the Sellers knowledge,
any other party to such Assumed Contract, is in material violation or breach
of or default under such Assumed Contract (or with notice or lapse of time or
both, would be in violation or breach of or default under such Assumed
Contract in any material respect). To the Sellers knowledge, no event has
occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without
notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to, (i) result
in a material breach or violation of, or default under, any such Assumed
Contract, (ii) give any entity the right to declare a default, seek damages or
exercise any other remedy under any such Assumed Contract, (iii) give any
entity the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any such Assumed
Contract or (iv) give any entity the right to cancel, terminate or modify any
such Assumed Contract.

2.10 Compliance with Laws. Seller is not in violation of or in default in any
material respect under any foreign or domestic (Federal, state or local) law,
statute, treaty, rule, regulation, ordinance, franchise, permit, concession,
license, order, decree, consent decree or similar instrument or determination
or award (collectively a "Law") applicable to it by which any of the
Purchased Assets or the Business is bound or affected.

2.11 Taxes.

(a) The Purchased Assets are not subject to any liens for Taxes, except liens
for Taxes not yet due, and Buyer will not become directly or indirectly
liable for, and no lien, claim or encumbrance will be placed upon the
Purchased Assets with respect to, (i) any Taxes attributable to the ownership
or use of the Purchased Assets with respect to periods prior to and including
the Closing Date or (ii) any other Taxes attributable to the actions or
activities of the Seller on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case other
than Transfer Taxes as provided in Section 1.3.



 

14 (b) "Tax" or, collectively, "Taxes" shall mean (i) any and all federal,
state, local, or non-US income, sales and use taxes, real and personal
property (tangible and intangible) taxes, gross receipts taxes, documentary
transfer taxes, excise taxes, employment taxes, withholding
taxes, unemployment insurance contributions, value added taxes and any other
taxes or governmental charges of any kind, however denominated, including any
interest, penalties and additions to tax in respect thereto, for which Buyer
could become liable as a result of acquiring the Business, the Purchased
Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities or which could result in a lien on or
charge against the Purchased Assets, and (ii) any liability for the payment of
any amounts of the type described in clause (i) as a result of any express or
implied obligation to indemnify any other person as a result of any
obligations under any agreements or arrangements with any other person with
respect to such amounts. "Tax Returns" means any return or report in respect
of Taxes.

(c) All Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the Business have
been timely filed. All Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown to be
due on such Tax Returns), the non-payment of which would result in an
Encumbrance on any Purchased Asset, have been timely paid. All such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Except as
otherwise disclosed on _Schedule 2.11(c)_ , there is no proceeding,
investigation, audit or examination proposed in writing or currently ongoing
in connection with the Business or the Purchased Assets in respect of any
Tax. Except as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule 2.11(c)_ , no deficiencies for
any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed in connection with the
Business or the Purchased Assets. Neither the Seller nor any of
its subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to pay any Tax, the non-payment of which would result in an Encumbrance
on any Purchased Asset, or to file any Tax Return with respect to such Taxes.
Neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes, the non-payment of which would result in an
Encumbrance on any Purchased Asset, or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, the non-payment of which would
result in an Encumbrance on any Purchased Asset. All Taxes required to have
been withheld in connection with the Business have been withheld and paid over
to the proper Governmental Authority. To the knowledge of the Seller, no
claim has ever been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the
Seller does not file Tax Returns that the Seller is or may be subject to
imposition of Taxes by that jurisdiction.

2.12 Brokers. Except for Cowen and Company, LLC, whose fees, commissions and
expenses are the sole responsibility of Seller, all negotiations relative to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been carried out
by Seller directly with Buyer without the intervention of any Person on behalf
of Seller in such manner as to give rise to any valid claim by any Person
against Buyer for a finders fee, brokerage commission or similar payment.

2.13 Purchased Assets. The Purchased Assets together with the Licensed Assets
constitute all of the assets related to, belonging to, used in or held for use
in the Business. Seller or its applicable subsidiaries have good and valid
title to, or in the case of any leased Purchased Assets have a valid
leasehold interest in, all of the Purchased Assets and Licensed Assets, and at
 



 

15  the Closing will transfer and deliver to Buyer good and valid title in, to
and under the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances except
the Buyer Field of Use Restrictions (as described in Schedule 1.1(b))
contained in the license granted in Section 1.1(b). Except for the Purchased
Assets, Licensed Assets or as set forth on _Schedule 2.13(i)_ , there are no
assets which either are reflected in the Business Balance Sheet or are
otherwise used primarily in the operation of the Business.

2.14 Customers. Listed in _Schedule 2.14_ are the names of the fifteen most
significant customers (by revenue) of each of the major solution segments of
the Business for the twelve-month period ended December 31,
2007 ("Significant Customers"). Seller has not received any written notice
and has no reason to believe that any Significant Customer has ceased, or will
cease, to use the products, equipment, goods or services of the Business or
has substantially reduced, or will substantially reduce, the use of such
products, equipment, goods or services.

2.15 Suppliers.  _Schedule 2.15_ contains a complete list of each of the ten
most significant suppliers of raw materials, supplies, merchandise, services
and other goods for the Business for the twelve-month period ended December
31, 2007 ("Significant Suppliers") and the amount for which each such
Significant Supplier invoiced Seller during such period. Seller has not
received any notice and has no reason to believe that any Significant Supplier
will not sell raw materials, supplies, merchandise, services and other goods
to the Business at any time after the Closing Date on terms and conditions
similar to those imposed on current sales to the Business, subject only to
general and customary price increases. 

2.16 Legal Proceedings. _Schedule 2.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, as of the date hereof, all proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Seller, threatened against, the Seller or any of its subsidiaries
involving the Business or any of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities or challenging the validity of this Agreement or any of the

subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject to any

complaints pending or threatened exclusively relating to or involving the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

16 (iii) the Business has been operated in material compliance with (A) all terms
and conditions of the Licenses and Permits and (B) all Laws applicable to the

24 4.4 Employees.

(a) _Employment_. On the tenth business day preceding the anticipated Closing
Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a revised version of _Schedule 2.6(a)_ ,
updated to reflect all changes in such Schedule that have occurred prior to
such day. No later than the fifth business day preceding the anticipated
Closing Date but effective as of the Closing Date and contingent on
the Closing and Sellers compliance with the provisions of Section 4.3
applicable to Employees, Buyer shall offer employment to all of the Employees
listed on revised _Schedule 2.6(a)_. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) provide Buyer with access to such Employees and
(ii) assist Buyer in extending offers of employment to such Employees. The
Buyer shall offer such employment on an "at-will" basis and at a wage and
salary level (excluding performance-based or incentive compensation, bonuses
and equity-based compensation, as applicable) that is the same as that
provided to the applicable Employee on the day preceding the Closing Date;
_provided_ that each offer to an Employee outside of the United States shall
be an offer at such compensation and benefit levels as required by applicable
local law or regulation and as to not constitute a constructive dismissal.
Each such offer that is made to an Employee who is actively employed in the
Business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date shall be an offer
to commence employment on the Closing Date. Each such offer that is made to an
Employee who is not actively at work with the Seller or any of
its subsidiaries due to a short- or long-term disability leave or other leave
of absence (but not including vacation), will be deemed to offer employment
with Buyer effective as of the date such Employee is willing and able to
return to active work status (the "Start Date"); _provided_ that in no event
will the Buyer be obligated to offer a Start Date that is later than three
months after the Closing Date. The Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer if
any Employees employed by the Seller or any of its subsidiaries either (i)
commences a short- or long-term disability leave or other leave of absence
(but not including vacation) during the period of time commencing with the
date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing Date, or (ii) returns to
active employment from any such leave. Each Employee to whom an offer of
employment is made pursuant to this Section 4.5(a) and who accepts such offer
and commences such employment with Buyer as of the Closing Date or Start
Date, as applicable, shall be referred to as a "Retained Employee" and
collectively as the "Retained Employees." In furtherance of the foregoing,
Seller shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Closing all
employment agreements and other arrangements with all Retained Employees.

(b)  _Benefit Plans_. During the period between the execution of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller, upon Buyers request, shall provide
reasonable assistance to Buyer with respect to the establishment of employee
benefit plans intended to replace the coverage provided to the Retained
Employees by their existing plans. From and after the Closing Date or, if
later, the Start Date of the Retained Employees, as applicable, the Buyer
shall recognize the prior service with the Seller or its subsidiaries of each
Retained Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or
policies of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which any Retained Employees
are eligible to participate following the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and levels of vacation and severance benefits (but not
for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
whether or not qualified under the Code, or any similar plan, or to the extent
that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From and
after the Closing Date or, if later, the Start Date of the Retained Employees,
as applicable, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and/or applicable
insurance providers, the Buyer  



 

25  will cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be
inapplicable, taking into account service with the Seller and any of its
Affiliates), under any group health plans of the Buyer or its Affiliates in
which Retained Employees are otherwise to become eligible to participate in
after the Closing Date, to be waived with respect to Retained Employees and
their eligible dependents. The Buyer shall give each Retained Employee credit
for any deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses paid
during the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs under any welfare
plans maintained or contributed to by the Seller or any of the Business
subsidiaries prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles and annual
out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses for the same plan year under any
welfare plans maintained or contributed to by the Buyer or its Affiliates in
which Retained Employees participate during such year.

(c) _Seller s Obligations and Liabilities_.

(i) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall file all Tax Returns with respect to its
employment of any Seller employee through the Closing Date and pay all Taxes
shown as due thereon.

(ii)  _Employees Terminated Prior to Closing_. Buyer shall not assume any
liabilities with respect to Sellers termination of employment of any Seller
employee on or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, all
accrued and unpaid wages and accrued vacation.

(iii) _Certain Benefit Payments_. Seller shall pay or otherwise discharge
any liability for claims filed with respect to any employee of Seller
eligible for coverage, reimbursement and/or benefits under the terms of any of
Sellers benefit plans, provided such liability (A) accrued or became payable
during the period of such employees employment with Seller prior to the
Closing Date or (B) arose out of Sellers termination of such employees
employment on or prior to the Closing Date.

(d) _No Rights Conferred Upon Employees_. The Parties hereby acknowledge that,
except as otherwise provided in clause (a) of this Section, Buyer is under no
obligation to employ any current or future employee of Seller. Further, Buyer
shall be under no obligation to (i) continue the employment of any Retained
Employee after Closing and nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights
or remedies under this Agreement on any such employee or (ii) continue any
Retained Employees coverage under any employment benefit plan.

4.5 Use of Intellectual Property. Following the Closing, Seller shall not use
any trade names, trade and service marks, logos and other designations
contained in the Purchased Assets, nor shall it use or put into use any
materials that bear any such trade name, trade or service mark, logo or other
designation contained in the Intellectual Property.

4.6 Excluded Liabilities. Seller will pay and discharge the Excluded
Liabilities as and when the same become due and payable.



 

26 4.7 Filing of Tax Returns; Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes; Cooperation.

(a) Subject to subsection (c) below, Seller will be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns of Seller (including Tax Returns
required to be filed after the Closing Date) to the extent such Tax Returns
include or relate to Sellers operation of the Business or Sellers use or
ownership of the Purchased Assets on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers
Tax Returns to the extent they relate to the Business or Purchased Assets
shall, in all material respects, be true, complete and correct and prepared in
accordance with applicable law. Except as provided in Section 1.3, Seller
will be responsible for and make all payments of Taxes shown to be due on such
Tax Returns.

(b) Buyer will be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns it is required to file with respect to Buyers ownership or use of the
Purchased Assets or its operation of the Business attributable to taxable
periods (or portions thereof) commencing after the Closing Date. Buyers Tax
Returns, to the extent they relate to the Purchased Assets or the Business,
shall be true, complete and correct and prepared in accordance with applicable
law in all material respects. Buyer will make all payments of Taxes shown to
be due on such Tax Returns.

(c) In the case of any real or personal property taxes, ad valorem taxes, or
other similar Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets for which Taxes are
reported on a Tax Return covering a period commencing before and ending after
the Closing (a "Straddle Period Tax"), any such Straddle Period Taxes shall
be prorated between Buyer and Seller on a per diem basis. The party required
by law to pay any such Straddle Period Tax shall file the Tax Return related
to such Straddle Period Tax within the time period prescribed by law
and shall timely pay such Straddle Period Tax, but the other party shall
reimburse the paying party for such other partys share of such Straddle
Period Taxes as provided herein.

(d) To the extent relevant to the Business or the Purchased Assets, each party
shall (i) provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be
required in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return and the conduct
of any audit or other examination by any taxing authority or in connection
with judicial or administrative proceedings relating to any liability
for Taxes and (ii) retain and provide the other with all records or other
information that may be relevant to the preparation of any Tax Returns, or the
conduct of any audit or examination, or other proceeding relating to Taxes.

(e) Seller and Buyer shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding (a "Tax Proceeding") relating
to any Straddle Period Taxes covered by Section 4.7(c) and each party shall
cooperate with the other party at its own expense. There shall be no
settlement or closing or other agreement with respect to any Tax Proceeding
relating to any Straddle Period Taxes without the consent of the other party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall
promptly notify the other party if it decides not to participate in
the defense or settlement of any such Tax Proceeding, in which case the other
party shall be permitted to defend and settle such Tax Proceeding.



 

27 (f) Straddle Period Taxes and Transfer Taxes shall be timely paid, and all
applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by
applicable law. The paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
non-paying party in accordance with Section 1.3 and Section 4.7(c), as the
case may be. Upon payment of any such Straddle Period Taxes and Transfer
Taxes, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled under Section 1.3 or Section 4.7(c), as the case may be, together
with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement
promptly but in no event later than 10 days after the presentation of such
statement. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the
London Inter Bank Offer Rate for six (6) month deposits in U.S. dollars as
quoted on Telerate page 3750 on the Closing Date for each day until paid.

(g) Buyer will be responsible for Taxes (and other taxes not included in the
definition of Taxes) accrued after the Closing Date in connection with the
ownership of the Business, Purchased Assets, and Assumed Liabilities,
including Taxes due to jurisdictions not part of the United States, and the
operation of the Business after the Closing Date, and Buyers share
of Transfer Taxes in accordance with Section 1.3.

4.8 Allocation of Consideration. The Parties agree that for income
tax purposes the consideration received by Sellers for the Purchased Assets
hereof shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that all financial reports
and income tax returns and reports, including IRS Form 8594, as applicable,
and any corresponding state or foreign tax forms, will be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with such allocation, and no party hereto will take any
position inconsistent with such allocation in any subsequent income tax
returns, reports, or proceedings. In addition, the Parties agree that
_Schedule 4.8(A)_ shall govern the allocation of such consideration among the
various Sellers of the Purchased Assets (the "Geographic Allocation"), which
allocation shall similarly be binding on the Parties for all income tax and
financial reporting purposes. Seller shall, within 30 days of execution of
this Agreement, prepare and furnish to Buyer  _Schedule 4.8(A)_. Buyer shall
have 14 days to object in writing to the Geographic Allocation, which
objection shall be made only if the allocation as proposed by the Seller is
unreasonable, and after which time (and assuming no such objection is made),
the Geographic Allocation shall be final. Seller shall, within one hundred
twenty (120) days of the Closing, prepare and furnish to Buyer _Schedule
4.8(B)_ (the "Section 1060 Allocation"). Buyer shall have sixty (60) days to
object in writing to the Section 1060 Allocation after which time (and
assuming no such objection is made) the Section 1060 Allocation shall be final
(the "Final Allocation"). If Buyer provides written notice to the Seller
prior to the end of such period that it objects to either the Geographic
Allocation or the Section 1060 Allocation, and Buyer and Seller cannot agree
on the Allocation within twenty (20) days of the provision of such notice
(the "Settlement Period"), such dispute shall be settled by an accounting firm
mutually selected by Seller and Buyer, provided that such accounting firm
shall apply the principles and methods set forth in this Section 4.8, after
which time the allocation determined by such accounting firm shall become the
Final Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall submit any such dispute to such
accounting firm within ten (10) days of the expiration of the Settlement
Period, and shall instruct such accounting firm to reach its determination of
such dispute within thirty (30) days of such submission. The Final Allocation
may be redetermined, consistent with the principals and methods set forth
in this Section 4.8, upon the happening of any event requiring such re-
determination. The Final Allocation, once determined, shall be annexed to this
Agreement as an exhibit, and any redetermination of the Final Allocation
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall likewise be annexed to this
Agreement with an appropriate designation.



 

28 4.9 Enforceability of Confidentiality Agreements. At Buyers request, Seller
shall assign to Buyer any confidentiality agreements relating exclusively to
the Business. If Seller is unable to assign such confidentiality agreements
because they do not relate exclusively to the Business or otherwise, Seller
shall enforce or permit Buyer to enforce on Sellers behalf any and all
rights of Seller relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets against the
other party thereto arising out of the breach thereof by such other party.

4.10 Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with any
applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction ("Bulk Sales
Laws") in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyer. Seller
agrees to pay and discharge in due course all claims made by creditors of
Seller, except those expressly assumed by Buyer in this Agreement.

4.11 Financial Statements. Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer an unaudited balance sheet for the Business and the
related unaudited consolidated statements of income for the Business as of and
for the period between January 1, 2008 and the Closing Date, each of which
shall be prepared in prepared in good faith and be derived from the Sellers
financial statements and be prepared in a manner consistent with the Business
Financial Statements.

4.12 Delivery of Schedules to the Agreement. As promptly as practical
following the date hereof, but in no event later than ten business days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer complete _Schedule A4_
 (Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, etc.) and _Schedule A5_ (Other Items of
Property) setting forth such assets to be transferred at Closing, which
schedules shall include the net book value and current location of such
assets.

4.13 Standstill Period. Buyer hereby agrees that, for a period of three (3)
years following the date hereof (the "Standstill Period"), Buyer will not
(and will ensure that Buyers Affiliates (and any person acting on behalf of
or in concert with Buyer or any of its Affiliates) will not), directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of
Seller, (i) acquire, agree to acquire, propose, seek or offer to acquire, or
facilitate the acquisition or ownership of, any securities or assets of Seller
or any of its subsidiaries, any warrant or option to purchase such securities
or assets, any security convertible into any such securities, or any other
right to acquire such securities, (ii) enter, agree to enter, propose, seek or
offer to enter into or facilitate any merger, business
combination, recapitalization, restructuring or other extraordinary
transaction involving Seller or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) make, or in any
way participate or engage in, any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to
advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting
securities of Seller, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group"
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to
any voting securities of Seller, (v) call, request the calling of, or
otherwise seek or assist in the calling of a special meeting of the
shareholders of Seller, (vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others,
to seek to control or influence the management or the policies of Seller,
(vii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement prohibited by, or
inconsistent with, the foregoing or (viii) advise, assist or encourage or
enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements or arrangements with
any other persons in connection with the foregoing. Buyer  



 

29  further agrees that during the Standstill Period Buyer will not (and Buyer
will ensure that Buyers Affiliates (and any person acting on behalf of or
in concert with Buyer or any of its Affiliates) will not), directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of
Seller, (x) make any request directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any
provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) in a manner that would
require public disclosure, or (y) take any action that might require Seller to
make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business
combination, merger or other type of transaction described in this paragraph.
The provisions of this paragraph shall be inoperative and of no force or
effect if any other person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act) shall have acquired or entered into a definitive agreement
(approved by the Board of Directors of Seller) to acquire more than 50% of the
outstanding voting securities of Seller or assets of Seller or its
subsidiaries representing more than 50% of the consolidated earning power
of Seller and its subsidiaries.

4.14 Non-Solicit. The Seller and the Buyer agree that for a period of one (1)
year from and after the Closing Date each party shall not, and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the
other party, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire (or cause to leave the
employ of a party or its subsidiaries) any employee of the other party unless
such Person ceased to be an employee of the other party or its subsidiaries
prior to such action by the soliciting party or any of its subsidiaries, or,
in the case of such Persons voluntary termination of employment with the
other party or its subsidiaries, at least three months prior to such action by
the soliciting party or any of its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.14 shall not apply to
general bona fide public advertisements for employment placed by the either
party or its subsidiaries and not specifically targeted at the employees of
either party or its subsidiaries or the hiring of any Persons who respond
to such advertisements. In addition, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall directly, or indirectly through another Person, for so long as Sellers
have continuing obligations under Section 4.15 below, call on, solicit or
service any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in order to induce or attempt to induce such
Person to cease doing business with Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Business, or in any way interfere with the relationship
between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation with
respect to the Business and Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including making
any negative statements or communications with respect to the Business about
Buyer or any of its Affiliates), or enter into any transaction, contract or
arrangement with any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation
relating to the Business.

4.15 Competition. In consideration of the Buyer entering into this Agreement
and in order that the Buyer may enjoy the full benefit of the Purchased
Assets and the Business, for a period of three (3) years from and after the
Closing Date (the "Noncompetition Period"), neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall carry on a business which is directly in competition with
the Business; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 4.15 none
of the existing businesses of the Sellers, as currently conducted or as
contemplated to be conducted, nor any of the existing businesses to
be acquired in the acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. shall
be considered to be competing with the Business. In addition, notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Seller of one of its Affiliates acquires any
Person during the Noncompetition Period whose business includes, but does not
primarily consist of, a business (the "Specified Division") which is directly
in competition with the Business (any such acquisition of a Specified
Division, a "Subsequent Acquisition"), such Subsequent Acquisition  



 

30  shall not be deemed to result in a breach or violation of the provisions of
this Section 4.15, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer hereby
irrevocably waives any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of this Section
4.15 in connection with any such Subsequent Acquisition. In the event of any
such Subsequent Acquisition, Seller shall, promptly following the closing of
such Subsequent Acquisition, provide written notice (the "Acquisition
Notice") of such Subsequent Acquisition, including (i) a detailed description
of the Specified Division acquired by Seller and (ii) an invitation to make an
offer to purchase the Specified Division from Seller. Within twenty days
after receipt of the Acquisition Notice, Seller may provide a written offer
(the "Offer") to Buyer to purchase the Specified Division. In the event an
Offer is not provided by Buyer to Seller within such twenty-day period, Buyer
shall have no further right with respect to the Specified Division and, for
the avoidance of doubt, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives any noncompliance or
alleged noncompliance by Seller with this Section 4.15 in connection with the
operation and management of the Specified Division by Seller or its Affiliates
from and after the closing of such Subsequent Acquisition. Upon receipt of any
Offer, Buyer and Seller hereby agree to work together in good faith to reach
mutually agreeable terms regarding the sale by Buyer to Seller of the
Specified Division. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this
Section 4.15 will be inadequate and, accordingly, the Seller covenants and
agrees that the Buyer shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies
which the Buyer may have at Law, be entitled to seek equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, and to seek the remedy of specific performance
with respect to any breach or threatened breach of such covenant, as may be
available from any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the Seller
and the Buyer agree that the terms of the covenant in this Section 4.15 are
fair and reasonable in light of the Buyers plans for the Purchased Assets and
the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill
and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the
covenants contained in this Section 4.15 shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any
such provision or provisions shall not be deemed void, and the parties hereto
agree that said limits may be modified by the court and that said covenant
contained in this Section 4.15 shall be amended in accordance with said
modification, it being specifically agreed by the parties that it is their
continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to the full extent of its
terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope of the covenant
unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to comply with

any Proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of the Seller or the knowledge

discussions with all Persons (other than Buyer) regarding all of the
foregoing, and that no Seller nor any Sellers officers, directors,

7.1 Indemnification by Seller. After the Closing Date and subject to the
additional provisions set forth in this Article VII, Seller shall indemnify
Buyer and Buyers stockholders, officers, directors, employees and
representatives (each a "Buyer Indemnitee") against, and hold each Buyer
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
payments and obligations, and all expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable legal fees and costs of settlement (collectively "Losses"),
incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly,
by, or imposed upon, such Buyer Indemnitee resulting from, related to or
arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy as of the date hereof or the
Closing Date of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements  



 

36  (in each case, determined without regard to any qualifications therein
referencing the terms "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or other
terms of similar import or effect); (ii) any breach by the Seller or any
failure of Seller to perform any of the covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements; (iii) the
Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities; and (iv) Losses from breach of
contract or other claims made by any party alleging to have had a contractual
or other right to acquire the Business or the Purchased Assets.

7.2 Indemnification by Buyer. After the Closing Date and subject to
the additional provisions set forth in this Article VII, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller and Sellers stockholders, officers, directors, employees and
representatives (each a "Seller Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Seller Indemnitee harmless from, any and all Losses, incurred, suffered,
sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly, by, or imposed upon,
such Seller Indemnitee resulting from, related to or arising out of (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements delivered to Seller pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements (in each case,
determined without regard to any qualifications therein referencing the terms
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or other terms of similar import or
effect); (ii) any breach by the Buyer or any failure of Buyer to perform any
of the covenants contained in this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements
delivered to Seller pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the
Transaction Agreements; and (iii) the Assumed Liabilities.

7.3 Losses. As used herein, "Losses" are not limited to matters asserted by
third parties, but include Losses incurred or sustained by an Indemnitee in
the absence of claims by third parties.

7.4 Third Party Claims.

(a) If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (each referred to as an
"Indemnitee") receives notice of the assertion by any third party of any
claim or of the commencement by any such third party of any action (any such
claim or action being referred to herein as an "Indemnifiable Claim") with
respect to which Seller or Buyer (each referred to as "Indemnitor") are or
may be obligated to provide indemnification, the Indemnitee shall promptly
notify the Indemnitor in writing (the "Claim Notice") of the Indemnifiable
Claim; provided, that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Indemnitor to provide indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent that any Losses directly resulted or were
caused by such failure.

(b) The Indemnitors shall have thirty days after receipt of the Claim Notice
(unless the claim or action requires a response before the expiration of such
thirty-day period, in which case the Indemnitors shall have until the date
that is ten days before the required response date) to acknowledge
responsibility and undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own
choosing, and at its expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the
Indemnitees shall cooperate with the Indemnitors in connection therewith;
provided, that (i) the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnitee to participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee,
provided that the fees and expenses of such Indemnitees counsel shall not be
borne by the Indemnitors, (ii) the Indemnitor shall not settle any
Indemnifiable Claim without the  



 

37  Indemnitees consent if the settlement (A) requires the Indemnitee to admit
wrongdoing, pay any fines or refrain from any action, (B) does not include a
full release of Indemnitee or (C) may reasonably be expected to impact the
ongoing operations of the Business, and (iii) if, in the opinion of counsel to
the Indemnitor, either (x) the Indemnitee has separate defenses from the
Indemnitor or (y) there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and
Indemnitee or (z) there is any danger of criminal liability of the Indemnitee,
then the Indemnitee shall be permitted to retain special counsel of its
own choosing at the expense of the Indemnitor. So long as the Indemnitor is
vigorously contesting any such Indemnifiable Claim in good faith, the
Indemnitee shall not pay or settle such claim without the Indemnitors
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty days after
receipt of the Claim Notice (or before the date that is ten days before the
required response date, if the claim or action requires a response before the
expiration of such thirty day period), that it acknowledges responsibility and
elects to undertake the defense of the Indemnifiable Claim described therein,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
Indemnifiable Claim in the exercise of its reasonable discretion; provided,
that the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of any compromise or
settlement of any such Indemnifiable Claim.

7.5 Survival Period. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, schedule or document delivered hereunder
shall survive the Closing Date as follows:

(a) the representations and warranties in Section 2.1 (Organization), Section
2.2 (Authorization), Section 2.12 (Brokers), Section 3.1 (Organization and
Qualification), and Section 3.2 (Authorization) shall terminate on the date
that is 30 days following the expiration date of the applicable statute of
limitations; and

(b) all other representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate, schedule or document delivered hereunder shall survive the
Closing Date until 11:59 p.m. California time on the date that is 12 months
following the Closing Date.

The indemnification obligations under Section 7.1(iii) and 7.2(iii) and the
covenants of Buyer set forth in Section 1.2 of this Agreement shall survive
the Closing indefinitely and all other covenants to be performed after the
Closing Date under this Agreement, including without limitation, the
indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 (ii), 7.1(iv) and 7.2(ii),
shall survive the Closing Date until 11:59 p.m. California time on the date
that is 30 days following the later of the expiration date of the applicable
statute of limitations or the time for performance thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would
otherwise terminate will continue to survive if a Claim Notice shall have been
timely given in good faith based on facts reasonably expected to establish a
valid claim under this Article VII on or prior to such termination date,
until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
resolved as provided in this Article VII. Neither the period of survival nor
the liability of Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) with respect to Buyers
or Sellers representations and warranties shall be affected by any
investigation made at any time (whether before or after the Closing Date) by
or on behalf of Seller or Buyer or by any actual, implied or constructive
knowledge or notice of any facts or circumstances that Seller or Buyer may
have as a result of any such investigation or otherwise. The Parties hereto
agree that reliance shall not be an element of any claim for misrepresentation
or indemnification under the Agreement.



 

38 7.6 Limits on Indemnification. Except with respect to Excluded Liabilities (in
the case of Seller) and Assumed Liabilities (in the case of Buyer), and
except with respect to claims for equitable remedies and claims based on
fraud, neither Buyer nor Seller shall have an indemnification obligation for
any amount for Losses arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated
in Sections 7.1(i) or 7.2(i), as appropriate, in excess of fifty percent (50%)
of the Cash Purchase Price, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any
indemnification obligation arising out of or resulting from the causes
enumerated in Section 7.1(i) or 7.2(i), as appropriate, until the amount of
all claimed indemnity payments exceeds $2,000,000, after which time Buyer or
Seller, as appropriate, shall be liable for all such indemnity payments above
such amount; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply
to recovery for an inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained in Section 2.1 (Organization), Section 2.2 (Authorization), Section
2.12 (Brokers), Section 3.1 (Organization and Qualification) or Section 3.2
(Authorization).

7.7 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to
treat any payment made under this Article VII as an adjustment to the Cash
Purchase Price.

7.8 Pre-Closing Infringement Indemnification.

(a) Seller will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any damages from any third party (other than any Affiliates of
Buyer) suit, claim or proceeding (including any court costs, reasonable
attorneys fees, and related litigation or arbitration expenses) brought
against Buyer between the Closing Date and the third anniversary of the
Closing Date arising out of or related to infringement or misappropriation by
the Business Products sold by Seller prior to the Closing Date of third-party
intellectual property rights, including without limitation patent, copyright
and trade secret rights ("Special Indemnification Matters").

(b) Seller will not have liability under this Section 7.8 to the extent the
infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights
arises from (i) Buyers modification of the Business Products, or (ii) the
combination of the Business Products with programs, data, equipment or
materials not supplied by Seller (if such infringement would have been
avoided by the use of the Business Products without such programs, data
equipment or materials).

(c) Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall
only arise if: (i) Buyer promptly notifies Seller in writing of the claim;
(ii) Seller has sole control of the defense and of any negotiations for
its settlement; and (iii) Buyer provides Seller with reasonable assistance
(at Sellers expense), information, and authority necessary to perform the
above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Buyer shall
be entitled to engage its own counsel at its own expense to participate in
such defense and any negotiations, and Seller shall not make any admission
that would be binding upon or detrimental to Buyer or make any compromise or
settlement that would result in liability to Buyer without Buyers express
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.



 

39 (d) Without limiting Sellers obligations pursuant to Section 7.8(a),
Seller shall have the right but not the obligation, to procure for the
benefit of Buyer, at Sellers expense, the right or license to any
intellectual property alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated.

(e) THIS SECTION 7.8 SETS FORTH SELLERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL INDEMNIFICATION MATTERS. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 7.8(e) is not intended to limit Sellers liability for breaches
of Section 2.5.

(f) SELLERS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS SECTION 7.8 SHALL NOT EXCEED TWENTY PERCENT
(20%) OF THE CASH PURCHASE PRICE.

ARTICLE VIII

_Miscellaneous_

8.1 Further Actions. From time to time, as and when requested by any party
hereto, each other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, such further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Agreement, to transfer, assign and deliver the Purchased Assets to Buyer and
its respective successors and assigns effective as of the Closing (or to
evidence the foregoing) and to consummate and give effect to the other
transactions, covenants and agreements contemplated hereby. To the extent that
the rights of Seller under any Contract may not be assigned without the
consent of another person which has not been obtained by Seller prior to the
Closing, neither this Agreement nor the Bill of Sale and Assumption Agreement
shall constitute an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment
would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful. If any such consent has not
been obtained or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would
impair Buyers rights under the instrument in question so that Buyer would
not effectively acquire the benefit of all such rights, then Seller, to the
maximum extent permitted by law and the instrument, shall, at Buyers request
and expense, act as Buyers agent in order to obtain for Buyer the benefits
thereunder and cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted by law and the
instrument, with Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide
such benefits to Buyer (including, without limitation, by entering into an
equivalent arrangement). Notwithstanding Buyers decision to consummate the
Closing in the absence of any such consent, after the Closing Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such consents and, if and
when any is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign the instrument in question
to Buyer.

8.2 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein, Seller and Buyer shall
each bear their own legal fees and other costs and expenses with respect to
the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

8.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, which includes the Schedules and the
Exhibits hereto and the other documents, agreements and instruments executed
and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, contains the entire agreement
between the Parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and supersedes all prior arrangements, understandings,
proposals, prospectuses, projections and related materials with respect
thereto, other than the Non-Disclosure Agreements between Buyer and Seller.
