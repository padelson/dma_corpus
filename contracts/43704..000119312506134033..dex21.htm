Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Sub shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.2. _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_.
Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to be amended in their entirety to
read as set forth in Exhibit A hereto, until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

Section 2.3. _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The Bylaws of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time.

Section 2.4. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
parties shall take all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time, (i)
the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of such directors to hold office,
subject to the applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors shall
be duly elected or appointed and qualified and (ii) the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, subject to the
applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, be the officers of, and hold the same positions with,
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall be duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation

of the Board designated by the Company who are members of the Board as of the

Section 2.5. _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of capital stock of
the Company:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares which are held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company or in the treasury of the Company, or which are held by Parent or Sub,
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, all  



 

11  of which shall cease to be outstanding and be canceled and none of which
shall receive any payment with respect thereto, and Dissenting Shares, which
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.9 hereof) and all rights in
respect thereof shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into and represent the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Price; and

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub, then
issued and outstanding, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.6. _Paying Agent; Surrender of Certificates_. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall (after consultation with the Company) designate
a bank or trust company located in the United States to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive funds in trust in order to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.5(a). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail and/or make available to each holder of a certificate which, prior to
the Effective Time, represented Shares or any portion of a Share (the "
_Certificates_ ") (other than those which are held by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the Company, or which are
held by Parent or Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent) a notice and letter of transmittal advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Paying
Agent such Certificate or Certificates in exchange for the aggregate Merger
Price deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II. Upon the
surrender for cancellation to the Paying Agent of such Certificates, together
with a letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions thereon, and any other items specified by the letter of
transmittal, the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Person entitled
thereto the product of the Merger Price and the number of Shares and any
portion of a Share represented by such Certificates. Until so surrendered,
each Certificate shall be deemed, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only
the right to receive upon such surrender the aggregate Merger Price
deliverable in respect thereof to which such Person is entitled pursuant to
this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrued in respect of such cash
payments.

(b) If the aggregate Merger Price (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of
such Merger Price that the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or
 



 

12  establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the aggregate Merger Price
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article
II.

(d) _Uncertificated Shares_. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
promptly following the Effective Time, to each holder of Shares registered in
the stock transfer books of the Company, but for which no certificates have
been issued (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Price multiplied by the number of Uncertificated Shares held by
such holder.

Section 2.7. _Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited in trust with the Paying Agent cash in United States
dollars in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (a) the number of
Shares reasonably expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares which are held by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the Company, or which are held
directly or indirectly by Parent, Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, or Dissenting Shares) and (b) the Merger Price (such amount, together
with any funds thereafter added being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Sub (i) in direct obligations of the United States, obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper of an issuer
organized under the laws of a state of the United States rated of the highest
quality by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Group,
or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of a United States commercial bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in assets
(collectively, " _Permitted Investments_ ") or (ii) in money market funds
which are invested in Permitted Investments, and any net earnings with respect
thereto shall be paid to Sub as and when requested by Sub. The Paying Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments referred to in
Section 2.5(a) out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Promptly following the date which is one year after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall return to the Surviving Corporation all
cash, certificates and other instruments in its possession that constitute any
portion of the Payment Fund, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate may surrender such Certificate to the
Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar Laws) receive in exchange therefor the aggregate Merger Price
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II,  



 

13  without interest, but shall have no greater rights against the Surviving
Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Certificates
for any Merger Price with respect to such Certificates delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws.

Section 2.8. _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective
Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of
the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except for, in
the case of a holder of a Certificate (other than Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.5(a)), the right to surrender his or her Certificate in
exchange for payment in accordance with this Article II, and no transfer of
Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.
Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in this Article II. As of
the Effective Time the stock ledger of the Company with respect to the Shares
shall be closed.

 

Section 2.9. _Dissenting Shares_. Each Share the holder of which has perfected
its right to dissent under Section 13.01 et seq. of the VBCA and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive any payment under this Article II, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the VBCA; provided, however,
that any Dissenting Share held by a Person at the Effective Time who shall,
after the Effective Time, withdraw the demand for payment for shares or lose
the right to payment for shares, in either case pursuant to the VBCA, shall
be deemed to be converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
payment pursuant to this Article II. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice upon receipt by the Company of any such written demands for payment of
the fair value of such Shares and of withdrawals of such notice and any other
instruments provided pursuant to applicable Law and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the demand for
payment of fair value for such Shares under the VBCA. Any payments made in
respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. The
Company shall not, prior to the Effective Time, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for payment of fair value, offer to settle or settle any such demands without
the written consent of Parent.

Section 2.10. _Stock Options and Deferred Stock Units_. (a) Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option and other right to
purchase Shares (each, an " _Option_ " and, collectively, the " _Options_ ")
heretofore granted under any stock option or stock-based compensation plan of
the Company or otherwise (the " _Stock Plans_ "), whether or not then vested
or exercisable shall no longer be exercisable for the purchase of Shares, but
shall entitle each holder thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to
payments in cash (the " _Cash Payment_ "), at the Effective Time, equal to
the  



 

14  product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Option, whether or
not then vested or exercisable and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the
Merger Price exceeds the exercise price per Share subject to such Option; each
such Cash Payment to be paid to each holder of an outstanding vested Option
promptly following the Effective Time, and such Option shall at such time be
cancelled. The Company shall terminate, as of the Effective Time, the Stock
Plans and amend, as of the Effective Time, the provisions of any other
Employee Benefit Plans providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
capital stock of the Company, or any interest in respect of any capital stock
of the Company, to provide no continuing rights to acquire, hold, transfer or
grant any capital stock of the Company or any interest in the capital stock of
the Company.

(b) _Deferred Stock Units_. Each DSU granted under a Stock Plan and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in lieu of such cancelled DSU
equal to product of (i) the number of Shares subject to such deferred stock
units and (ii) the Merger Price.

Section 2.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take all such reasonable steps as may be permitted through resolutions of
the Board to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the
Company by each individual who is at the Effective Time subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 2.12. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Article VII, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at 10:00 A.M. at the offices of Downs Rachlin Martin
PLLC, Courthouse Plaza, 199 Main Street, Burlington, Vermont 05402, as soon as
practicable, but in any event within five Business Days after the last of the
conditions set forth in Article VI is satisfied or waived, other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions, or at such other
date, time or place as the parties hereto shall agree in writing. Such date is
herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 2.13. _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Sub and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted or withheld, from any payment made pursuant to this
Article II, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.



 

15 Section 2.14. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Price shall
be equitably adjusted.

licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the property owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement complete and correct copies of the Companys Articles of
Association and the Companys Bylaws and the comparable governing documents of
each of its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.

this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by the Board, the
Board has adopted this Agreement, and no other corporate action on the part of
the Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than, in each case, as required by the VBCA, the
approval of this Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote and the filing of
Articles of Merger with the  



 

16  Secretary of State of the State of Vermont). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and by general equitable principles. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, (a) conflict with any of the provisions of the
Articles of Association or Bylaws of the Company or with any of the provisions
of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or other equivalent governing
documents, as applicable, of any of its Subsidiaries, (b) with or without

lease license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation whether oral or written (each a " _Contract_ ") to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets are bound or subject, or

filings and notices referred to in Section 3.4 hereof, contravene any domestic
or foreign Law, rule or regulation or any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award currently in effect, applicable to the Company
or its Subsidiaries except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for any
such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or
change that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

applicable, under the Exchange Act). As of the date of the most recent
evaluation included in the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form
10-K filed before the date hereof, such internal control over financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting by its chief executive officer and
its chief financial officer (or, as the case may be, acting chief financial
officer) prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and
the audit committee of the Board (A) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Since December 31, 2004, no material complaints from any source
regarding  



 

19  accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from Employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters,
have been received by the Company.

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets of the Company included in or
incorporated by reference into the Commission Filings (including the related
notes and schedules) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except (i) in
the case of Commission Filings made prior to the date of this Agreement, as
may be indicated therein or in the notes or schedules thereto and (ii) in the
case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the Commission) and fairly presents or, in the case of Commission Filings
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows and changes in shareholders equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the Commission Filings fairly presents, or in the case of
Commission Filings filed after the date hereof, will fairly present the
results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustment that will
not be material in amount or effect). 

(e) Except as reflected, reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the
balance sheets, the notes to the financial statements or managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of
the Company included in the Commission Filings most recently filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and other
than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since December
31, 2005 , neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations (absolute, accrued, fixed, contingent or otherwise) other than
liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or liabilities contemplated by this Agreement to be incurred pursuant
to this Agreement or the Merger.

and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Law, rule,
regulation or order of any Governmental Entity, applicable to the Company or
its  



 

21  Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or effected, except for violations that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all federal, state, local and
foreign permits, approvals, licenses, franchises,
authorizations, certificates, rights, exemptions and orders from Governmental
Entities (the " _Permits_ ") that are necessary for the operation of the
business of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the date
hereof, except to the extent that any such failure to hold Permits would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Permits, and with all other permits,
approvals, licenses, authorizations, certificates, rights, exemptions, and
orders that they hold, except to the extent that any such non-compliance
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the existence of which has been disclosed
to the Company, is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no material change is required in the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in
connection with any such Laws, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any
such Laws that has not been cured as of the date hereof.

Section 3.8. _Litigation_. There is no civil, criminal or administrative
action, suit, proceeding at law or in equity, or any arbitration or any
administrative or other proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity,
pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties
or rights which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which,
individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 3.9. _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) All benefit and compensation plans,
contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Employees_ ") and current or former
directors of the  



 

22  Company, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, severance, stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and
bonus plans (the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ ") are listed on Section 3.9 of
the Company Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that any such benefit or
compensation plan, contract, policy or arrangement covering former employees
or former directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall only be
deemed to be an Employee Benefit Plan and shall only be listed on Section 3.9
of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent such plan, contract, policy or
arrangement is material. Each Employee Benefit Plan which has received a
favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "),
including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified on
Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) All Employee Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), are in
substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each
Employee Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is
an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering
all tax Law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company does not have Knowledge of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of any such
Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date of this Agreement, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary of it to a
tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 or Section 4980 of the Code
or Section 502(i) or Section 4071 of ERISA in an amount which would be
material.

(c) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg. Section 4043.33 or
4043.66, has been required to be  



 

23  filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection
with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been
required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under
Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (including Section
412(m)). 

(d) All contributions required to be made under each Employee Benefit Plan, as
of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each Employee Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected
in the Companys financial statements referred to in Section 3.5 Neither any
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to
Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It
is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any
Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by
application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension
Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

(e) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of
such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending or threatened
litigation relating to the Employee Benefit Plans (other than Multiemployer
Plans). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations
for retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective
bargaining agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate
any retiree health and life benefits plans at any time without incurring any
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.

(g) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Employee Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor  



 

24  for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting (except as required
by the Code or ERISA) or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Employee Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Employee Benefit Plans or (z) result in
payments under any of the Employee Benefit Plans which would not be deductible
under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

(h) The actions contemplated in Section 2.10(a) of this Agreement are
permissible pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Options, Stock Plans,
Deferred Compensation Plan for Officers and Directors and Employee Benefit
Plans, without the necessity for consents or waivers from any Option holders
or plan participants.

Section 3.10. _Labor Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or
other Contract with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding that asserts
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair
labor practice or that seeks to compel it to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has there been since December 31, 2001, any labor strike,
dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in
all material respects with the reporting requirements of the Labor Management
Reporting and Disclosure Act. No labor organization or group of employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for
recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification
proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought or
filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority.

Section 3.11. _Taxes_.

(a) All material Tax Returns that are required to be filed (taking into
account extensions of the time for filing) on or before the Closing by or with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, have been or will be timely filed
on or before the Closing, and all such Tax Returns are or, at the time filed,
will be, true, correct and complete in all material respects.



 

25 (b) All material Taxes whether or not shown to be due on a Tax Return have
been or, if not yet due, but due before Closing, will have been timely paid
in full on or before the Closing. Other than Taxes incurred in the ordinary

Subsidiarys (respectively) latest Tax Returns.

(c) All Tax deficiencies asserted or assessments made by a Taxing authority
have been paid in full or are adequately provided for in the Companys most

a change in accounting method for a Tax period beginning on or before the
Closing, to include any material adjustment under Section 481(c) of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) in taxable income
for any Tax period beginning on or after the Closing Date, or (B) any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law), to include any material item of income
in or exclude any material item of deduction from any Tax period beginning on
or after the Closing.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have never been members of an affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary Tax group for purposes of filing any Tax
Return, other than a group of which the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including any former Subsidiaries) were all the members.

(h) No currently effective closing agreements, private letter rulings,
technical advance memoranda or similar agreement or rulings have been entered
into or issued by any taxing authority with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

the Company or its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use, free and clear
of all Liens, all Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries substantially as presently conducted
except where the failure to so own or have such right, or the presence of such
Liens, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Since December 31, 2003, the Company has not received written notice and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no claim has been threatened by any person,

Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company, except
as set forth in the correspondingly numbered section of the Parent Disclosure

Parent and Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in

and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of
Parent and Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Parent and Sub has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, in each case, as amended and in
full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Sub
is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized and adopted by the
board of directors of each of Parent and Sub and have been duly approved by
Parent as sole shareholder of Sub. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, Parent will have approved this Agreement as the sole shareholder of
Sub. No other corporate action on the part of either of Parent or Sub
is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by each of Parent and Sub and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the filing of the appropriate merger documents
as required by the VBCA and the approval of the merger by Parent, the sole
Shareholder of Sub). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Sub and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Company, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Sub in  



 

33  accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and by general
equitable principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, (a) conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate or articles
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable documents) of Parent or Sub, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement, (b) conflict with, result in a
breach of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

or any of their respective assets is bound or subject or (c) subject to the
consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and notices
referred to in Section 4.3, contravene any domestic or foreign Law, rule or

Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 4.3. _Consents and Approvals_. No Consent of or to, or waiver by, any
Governmental Entity which has not been received or made, is required by or
with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent or Sub or the consummation by Parent or Sub, as the
case may be, of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for (a) expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, (b) the Consent of each of the VPSB and the FERC, (c) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and any applicable state

consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or notices which, if not made
or obtained, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

supplied by Parent or Sub in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Proxy Statement or (ii) the Other

or supplement thereto is mailed to shareholders, and at the time of the

state any material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Other Filings made by Parent or Sub will, at the
respective times filed with the Commission, comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, if applicable, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Sub with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by
the Company in writing specifically for inclusion in the Other Filings.

Sub), no agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of Parent or Sub is
or shall be entitled to any fee, commission or brokers or finders fees in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
from any of the parties hereto or from any Affiliate of the parties hereto.

Agreement, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or is a party to any agreement,

take such action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal would be a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (C) in the case of clause (I),
such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, and (D) in the case of clause (I), the Company shall have
provided prompt notice to Parent of its intent to take such action, the
identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of such proposal. Notwithstanding the  



 

42  foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.6 or any other provision of this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party to the extent required under Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure as, in the
good faith judgment of the Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel), is required under applicable Law or that the failure to make such
disclosure would cause the Board to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
action will constitute a withdrawal, change, modification, qualification or
amendment of the Company Board Recommendation if it changes, withdraws,
modifies, qualifies or amends the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent or has the substantive effect of withdrawing, changing,
modifying, qualifying or amending the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent.

(c) The Board (or any committee thereof) shall not adopt or recommend, or
propose to adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding this subsection (c) or any other provision of
this Agreement, that the Board may if the Company is not in material violation
of Section 5.6 (a) or (b), recommend to its shareholders an Acquisition
Proposal or withdraw, change, modify, qualify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and, simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement enter into a Contract to consummate
a transaction constituting a Superior Proposal if (x) the Board has received
an Acquisition Proposal that it has determined in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisors, is a Superior Proposal and (y) the Company has notified Parent in
writing of the terms of the Superior Proposal and of its intent to take such
action, and has taken into account any revised proposal made by Parent to the
Company within five (5) Business Days after delivery to Parent of such notice
and again has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal (as the same may have been modified or amended or proposed to be
modified or amended) remains a Superior Proposal.

(d) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any material written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including
any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified. The Company
also agrees to enforce the terms of any standstill agreement made in its
favor.  



 

43 Section 5.7. _Regulatory Approvals Committee; Regulatory Filings and
Approvals; Other Consents_. (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof,
Parent and the Company shall establish a joint regulatory approvals committee
(the " _Regulatory Approvals Committee_ ") which shall be compromised of three
nominees of Parent and three nominees of the Company. Each of the members of
the Regulatory Approvals Committee may be removed, with or without cause, by
the person appointing the same. Vacancies shall be filled by the person
appointing the member whose departure gives rise to such vacancy. The
Regulatory Approvals Committee shall be chaired by a nominee of Parent and
shall have the objective of facilitating the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, integration planning and strategic development. The Regulatory
Approvals Committee shall meet monthly in the Vermont or upon such other date
or dates, and in such other places, as Parent and the Company may agree from
time to time and may be convened by telephone, video conference or similar
means. The Regulatory Approvals Committee shall make recommendations to Parent
and the Company for actions to facilitate the receipt of regulatory approvals
on the most advantageous practicable terms and on other matters of planning
and integration the Regulatory Approvals Committee may deem appropriate. The
parties agree that Parent shall have the authority to make, after consultation
with the Company through the Regulatory Approvals Committee, decisions
regarding the prosecution of regulatory approvals. The provisions of this
Section 5.7 are subject to the provisions of Section 5.21.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and without
limiting the provisions of Section 5.4(c), each party hereto shall jointly,
through the Regulatory Approvals Committee, develop a regulatory approvals
plan and proceed cooperatively and in good faith to (i) take promptly all
actions reasonably necessary to make the filings required of it or any of its
Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, filing with
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade

respect to the Merger, (ii) comply reasonably promptly with any formal or
informal request for additional information or documentary material received

Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, waivers,

registration or filing with or notification to (any of the foregoing, a "
_Consent_ ") of  



 

44  any Governmental Entity, including the VPSB and FERC, or any other third
party required in connection with, and any waivers of any breaches or
violations of any Contracts, permits, licenses or other agreements that may
be caused by the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by (i) promptly making all required filings or
submissions to Governmental Entities and (ii) cooperating with one another in
(A) determining whether any other filings are required to be made with, or
Consents are required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or any other
third party in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely
making all such filings and timely seeking all such Consents. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to and shall not be required to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not, in connection with obtaining any Consents, agree or consent to any
condition, provision, liability or term that, individually or in the aggregate
with all other such conditions, provisions, liabilities or terms, and
together with any adverse effect as compared to the Expected Outcome, would
reasonably be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
materially impair any of Parents expected benefits of the Merger or (iii)
impair, other than in an immaterial manner, the value to Parent of any
material tax attributes arising out of or related to the Merger or the
financing of the Merger or the Companys operations after the Merger.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall keep each other informed of any
material communication (other than lawyer/client privileged material), and
provide to the other copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors)
and any Antitrust Authority or any other Governmental Entity relating to this
Agreement and shall permit the other to review any material communication to
be given by it to, and, to the extent practicable, shall consult with each
other in advance of any telephone calls, meetings or conferences with, any
Antitrust Authority or any other Governmental Entity and, to the extent
permitted or practicable, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such telephone calls, meetings and conferences; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it is agreed that Parent shall have primary responsibility
for the preparation and filing of any applications, notices, petitions or
filings with any Antitrust Authority or Governmental Entity relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the Company will
not consult, discuss or correspond with such Antitrust Authority or
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby without providing Parent with the right to participate in
any such consultation, discussion or correspondence; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not make any such applications,
notices, petitions or filings without the prior written consent of Parent. To
the extent that competitively sensitive information is provided to any
Antitrust Authority by the Company, the Company shall, to the extent required
by Law, withhold copies of correspondence containing such information from  



 

45  Parent, limit disclosure to Parents outside counsel, or provide such
information to Parent in a manner and form consistent with the Antitrust
Laws. 

Section 5.8. _Changes to Rates or Charges_. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, obtain Parents written consent prior to initiating any
general rate case and to consult with Parent prior to making any material
changes in the Companys or its Subsidiaries rates or charges, standards of
service or accounting from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and
to further consult with Parent prior to initiating any proceeding (or filing
any amendment thereto), or effecting any agreement, commitment, arrangement or
consent, whether written or oral, formal or informal, with respect thereto.
The Company shall not amend or agree to any material change or modification to
the Rate Case without consulting, and taking good faith consideration of the
recommendation of, the Regulatory Approvals Committee.

Section 5.9. _Employee Benefits_. Parent agrees that, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided
with compensation (i.e., base salary and bonus opportunities, but specifically
excluding any equity-based compensation, awards and grants) and benefits
under employee benefit plans that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such employees. Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
thereunder (except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans,
for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits), service by employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the
same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all employee
benefit obligations to current and former employees under the Employee Benefit
Plans in existence on the date of this Agreement and all employment
agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by the board of directors
of the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular
Employee Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular
employee. Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the terms of
any employment agreement entered into with any employee.

Section 5.10. _Indemnity; Directors  and Officers Insurance; Fiduciary and
Employee Benefit Insurance_. (a) Parent agrees that (i) all rights to
indemnification now existing in favor of any individual who at or prior to the
Effective Time was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such individuals
heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in any such  



 

46  entitys respective charters, bylaws, indemnification and trust agreements,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and that (ii) any such
indemnification agreements shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (d)
of this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices Parent. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor
are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request of
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred; (ii) Parent will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); and _provided_ , _further_ that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not available
with respect to any Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase for the benefit
of the Surviving Corporation a "tail policy" covering a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions prior to the
Effective Time as provided (i) by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies and (ii) by the Companys fiduciary and employee
benefit policies, in each case, providing substantially the same benefits and
levels of coverage as the insurance policies currently in effect and covering
those Persons who are covered on the date of this Agreement by such policies,
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required to expend more than
$1,500,000 to procure such directors and officers insurance coverage, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the cost thereof exceeds such threshold,
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as is reasonably available at a cost of not more than $1,500,000.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify all Indemnified Parties, to the extent
permitted by Vermont Law, with respect to all acts and omissions arising  



 

47  out of such individuals services as officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan
for the benefit of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the execution of, and the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Without limitation of the
foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved, in
any capacity, in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with
any matter, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
occurring prior to and including the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, from and after the Effective Time, shall pay, as incurred, such
Indemnified Partys reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith;
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party to whom legal and other expenses are
paid provides a written undertaking, executed personally or on the Indemnified
Partys behalf, to repay to the Surviving Corporation the expenses paid if it
is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification,
and that any determination required to be made with respect to whether a
Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under Vermont Law and
the Companys Articles of Association and Bylaws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation contained in this Section 5.10 shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In
the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.10 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 5.10 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section
5.10 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.10).

to (i) consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) provide to the other party for review a copy of any such
press release or public statement and (iii) not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and review and
the receipt of the prior consent of the other parties to this Agreement,
unless required by applicable Law or any listing  



 

48  agreement with a securities exchange or Nasdaq or otherwise in compliance
with Section 5.6; _provided_ , _however_ , public statements may be made in
the course of regulatory proceedings at the request of any Governmental Entity
as necessary and as deemed reasonable by the Person making such public
statement, without such prior consultation.

Section 5.12. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify each
other of (a) any material actions, suits, claims or proceedings in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced or, to the
Knowledge of Parent or, as the case may be, the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably likely to cause any
condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such notification,
shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants of any party or the
conditions to the obligations of any party to this Agreement.

Section 5.13. _Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.14. _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

Section 5.15. _Termination of Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
and Employee Savings and Investment Plan_. No later than the Closing, the

Company, as the borrower, and Chittenden Bank, as the lender, dated August 3,
2005 (the " _Note_ ") , to the effect that the Merger will not be deemed to
constitute an "Event of Default" under the terms thereof, the Company shall,
prior to the Closing, prepay in full any amounts due under the Note and shall
not borrow any further funds under the Note. 

Section 5.17. _Corporate Offices_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain
its corporate office in the northwest portion of Vermont.

(v) the Company and its Subsidiaries have suffered a Company Material Adverse
Effect after December 31, 2005.

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 by Parent, on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such

and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of Parent, Sub or the
Company, except that Section 5.2, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall

54 ARTICLE VIII

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 8.1. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b)
below and except as set forth in Section 5.7(a), all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses.

(b) In the event that (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or
proposed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its shareholders
or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is terminated (i) by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) or (ii) by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), (y) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iv), or (z) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii) then the Company shall promptly, but
in no event later than two days after the date of such termination (except in
the case of clause (z) in which case the Initial Termination Fee shall be
paid prior to termination), pay Parent an initial termination fee of
$3,500,000 (the " _Initial Termination Fee_ ") payable by wire transfer of
same day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Initial Termination Fee
shall not be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (x) of this paragraph (b)
unless and until within eighteen (18) months of such termination the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality or
standstill agreement) with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have
adopted or recommended to the Companys shareholders or otherwise
not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal and, in the case of clause (x)(i), such
Acquisition Proposal is from the Person that made an Acquisition Proposal
prior to the termination of this Agreement, or an affiliate of such Person (a
" _Covered Proposal_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that in any case in which
an Initial Termination Fee is required to be paid an additional fee of
$3,500,000 (the " _Additional Termination Fee_ ") shall be paid to Parent by
the Company in immediately available funds prior to the consummation of a
transaction resulting from an Acquisition Proposal if such transaction is
consummated within 24 months after the payment of the Initial Termination Fee
( _provided_ that in the case of a fee payable pursuant to clause (x)(i) such
Acquisition Proposal is a Covered Proposal). The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.1(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section
8.1(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Sub commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee, charges or
expenses to which reference is made in this paragraph (b), the Company shall
pay to Parent  



 

55  or Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the "prime
rate" (as announced by Citibank, N.A.) in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

Section 8.2.  _Representations and Warranties_. The respective
representations and warranties of the Company, on the one hand, and each of
Parent and Sub, on the other hand, contained herein or in any certificates or
other documents delivered prior to or at the Closing shall expire with, and
be terminated and extinguished by, the Closing, and thereafter none of the
Company, Parent or Sub shall be under any liability whatsoever with respect to
any such representation or warranty. This Section 8.2 shall have no effect
upon any other obligation of the parties hereto, whether to be performed
before or after the Effective Time.

Section 8.3. _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to the express limitations herein,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken
by or on behalf of the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent or Sub, may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein by any other applicable party
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any
other applicable party or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS, EXCEPT FOR SECTIONS 5-1401 AND

any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions

WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law,
