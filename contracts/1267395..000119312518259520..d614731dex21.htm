other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to
the Companys reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth,  _inter alia_ ,

effectiveness of the Merger and (B) cash in an amount equal to the number of

this  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable

24

    

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have

such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving
Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to

Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to look
only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the Surviving
Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the
Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, none of the parties, the Surviving Company, or the Paying

escheat, or similar Law.

(f) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject to _Section_ __
_ 3.05_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares formerly represented
by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such underlying Company Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the
last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.02(d)_, if, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under (i) the Code, or under any provision of other
applicable Tax Law; or (ii) pursuant to the terms of any Company Plan, Company
Award, or Company Share Purchase Plan Award. Any amounts that are deducted
and withheld from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
or payable to any current or former director, officer, employee or other
individual service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether
by virtue of any termination, severance, change of control or similar benefit
or otherwise), (ii) cause the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to
fund any benefits under any Company Plan or (iii) limit or restrict the right

acceleration of vesting) or benefits constituting an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are not a party to, and are not otherwise obligated under, any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of a
Tax, interest or penalties imposed by Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code

state securities or blue sky Laws, (g) approvals, filings, and notices under
all applicable Insurance Laws as set forth in Section 5.03 of the Parent

Insurance Approvals (assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties made in _Section_ __ _ 4.04(g)_ and the completeness of Section
4.04 of the Company Disclosure Letter), no Consent of, or filing, declaration,
or registration with, or notification to, or waiver from, any Governmental
Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their
obligations hereunder, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions, other than such other Consents, filings, declarations, or
registrations that, if not obtained, made, or given, would not constitute a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
a reasonable basis to believe that the Parent Insurance Approvals set forth on
Section 5.03 of the Parent Disclosure Letter will be obtained prior to the
Walk-Away Date.

 

Section 5.04 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the issued and outstanding shares of Merger
Sub, free and clear of all Liens. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the Transactions, has no assets, liabilities or obligations of
any nature, other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to
the Transactions, and, prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in
any business activities other than those relating to the Transactions.

 

Section 5.05 _Sufficiency of Funds_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed Equity Commitment Letter. Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in
accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, at the Closing, Parent will have
sufficient funds to pay the Merger Consideration and all other amounts
required to be paid by Parent at Closing under this Agreement, and all related
fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent in connection
with the Transactions (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ "). As of the date
hereof, there are no side letters or other Contracts relating to the funding
of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter.

(b) As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated, or rescinded or otherwise
amended, supplemented, or modified in any respect and no such amendment,
supplement, or modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, by the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, the Equity
Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to the Company, is a legal, valid,
and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties 

 



58

    

 thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, such
other parties thereto in accordance with its terms and conditions, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge
of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a material
default or breach on the part of Parent or any Investor under any term, or a
failure to satisfy a condition, of the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise
result in any portion of the Equity Financing necessary to satisfy the
Financing Uses contemplated thereby being unavailable on the date on which the
Closing should occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06_. As of the date
hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, Parent has no reason to believe that it
or any Investor would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Equity Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it or
that the full amount of the Equity Financing will not be available to it at
the Closing.

Section 5.06 _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no Contracts or commitments to enter into Contracts (a) between Parent,
Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or the Company Board, on the other hand, that relate in
any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Transactions, (b)
pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve
the Merger and this Agreement or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal,
or (c) between Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any holder of Company Awards, on the other hand, pursuant to which
such holder would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03_.

 

Section 5.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement to be sent to the holders of
Company Shares in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting (including
any amendment or supplement thereto or document incorporated by
reference therein) shall, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the holders of Company Shares, at the time of any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading or omit to state a material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting which has become false or
misleading.

 

Section 5.08 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as would not constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no (a)
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened legal or administrative
proceeding, suit, arbitration, action, claim, controversy, dispute, hearing,
charge, complaint, examination, indictment, litigation, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, investigation against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than ordinary course claims made under or in connection with Contracts
of insurance issued by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) or (b) outstanding
injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree, or writ imposed upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before any Governmental
Authority.

 



59

    

Section 5.09 _Ownership of Company Shares, 5.95% Preference Shares or
5.625% Preference Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange
Act), or will prior to the Closing Date beneficially own, any Company Shares,
5.95% Preference Shares, or 5.625% Preference Shares, or is a party, or will
prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any Contract (other than this
Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of any
Company Shares, 5.95% Preference Shares or 5.625% Preference Shares.

Section 5.10 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Willis Towers Watson and
Libero Ventures, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no
broker, investment banker, financial advisor, or other Person is entitled to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors, or other similar fee or
commission or the reimbursement of expenses in connection therewith, in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.11 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have caused Guarantors to deliver the Guarantee, dated
as of the date hereof, to the Company. The Guarantee is in full force and
effect (assuming the due authorization, execution, and delivery thereof by the
other parties thereto). The Guarantee constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantors and is enforceable against the
Guarantors, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no
default under the Guarantee by the Guarantors, and no event has occurred that
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
default thereunder by Guarantors.

Section 5.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger
Sub in this _Article V_ and in the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Guarantee, neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor any other Person makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise), or prospects,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the Company or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates of any documentation, forecasts, or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing, and the Company
acknowledges the foregoing.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article_ __ _ IV_, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree and acknowledge that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person, has
made or is making, and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on, any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), or prospects,
including with respect to any information made available to Parent, Merger

such determination and notifies Parent no later than 1 business day after it
has taken such action (which notices shall describe the action taken or to be
taken and the rationale therefor).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _
6.01(c)(i)_, if (x) the Company takes any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.01(c)(i)(B)_ and the taking of such action causes, or would reasonably be
expected to cause, a significant adverse economic consequence for the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or increases, in any respect, the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Shares in
accordance with _Article III_ , or (y) without the express prior written
consent of Parent, the Company takes, or refrains from taking, any action
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)(i)(B)_ and such action, or failure to act,
would otherwise violate the provisions of _Sections 6.01(a)(i)_ , _(iii)_ ,
_(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(x)_ , _(xi)_ , _(xii)_ , _(xv)_ , _(xx)_ , _(xxiv)_ ,
_(xxvii)_ , _(xxviii)_ , _(xxx)_ or _(xxxv)_ in any material respect (any
such action, or failure to act, under clause (x) or clause (y), a "
_Triggering Event_ "), then in either case Parent shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_ on or prior
to the 20th business day after the later of (A) the date on which the Company
causes (by action or failure to act) a Triggering Event and (B) the date on
which the Company notifies Parent that it has caused (by action or failure to
act) a Triggering Event. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the taking of any such action, or failure
to act, under clause (x) or clause (y) in the circumstances contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)(ii)_ will not constitute a breach or violation of this
Agreement by the Company for any other purpose and will not result in a right
of termination, other than pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, capitalize or agree to any capital plan
with respect to Aspen Insurance Ireland Designated Activity Company in any
manner that is inconsistent with the capital plan set forth in the
application to the Central Bank of Ireland for authorization of Aspen
Insurance Ireland Designated Activity Company as an insurance carrier, which
was submitted by the Company to the Central Bank of Ireland prior to the date
hereof, in any case, without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.02 _No Solicitation by the Company; Change in Recommendation_.

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company shall and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and its and their respective
directors, officers, and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives (including by providing written
direction to its financial advisor informing it of the obligations set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_), as applicable, to,
(i) immediately cease any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or
negotiations of or with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a
Takeover Proposal and (ii) during the period from the date of

 this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , not, directly or indirectly, (A)

submission of any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer, in each case
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal, (B) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any submission, proposal, announcement, offer, or
inquiry that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover

connection with a Takeover Proposal or any such submission, proposal,
announcement, offer, or inquiry, (C) enter into any Company Acquisition
Agreement, (D) terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of
any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party in connection with any Takeover Proposal or any submission,

Takeover Proposal (unless the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under applicable Law),
(E) reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses of any Person (other than
the Companys Representatives) in connection with any Takeover Proposal, or
(F) publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Promptly following
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, to the extent it had not
previously done so prior to the date of this Agreement, deliver a request to
each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company

received non-public information from or on behalf of the Company during such
period, in either case, in connection with considering or making a Takeover
Proposal to promptly return or destroy any non-public information previously
furnished or made available to such Person or any of its Representatives on
behalf of the Company or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may waive, and
may choose not to enforce, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality
agreement with any Person that would prohibit such Person from communicating
confidentially a Takeover Proposal to the Company Board, if and only to the
extent that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company receives a bona fide Takeover Proposal, which Takeover
Proposal did not result from any material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_
( _provided_ that, solely for purposes of determining whether a breach of the
first sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ has occurred for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(ii)_, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of
determining whether a breach has occurred for purposes of Section 8.02 or
Section 8.03(a)(i), the Companys obligation to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to comply with the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ shall be a covenant (without qualification of
reasonable best efforts) to cause its Representatives to comply with clauses
(i) and (ii) of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_), then (i) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to
request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing; 
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material
written correspondence with any such Person or its Representatives and
communicate to

 



69

    

 Parent any material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal that were
orally communicated to the Company or its Representatives by such Person and
(ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
then the Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information (including non-
public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal; _provided_
that the Company (1) shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of such

Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal after entering into

thereof) and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and conditions of any
such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Takeover Proposal and unredacted copies of all proposals, offers,
indications of interest, term sheets, or other material agreements and
documents with respect thereto or that contain proposed terms of such Takeover
Proposal and communicate to Parent any material terms and conditions orally
communicated to the Company or its Representatives in connection with such
Takeover Proposal, in each case, as promptly as practicable (and in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt or delivery thereof. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments
with respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes
thereto and provide copies of proposals, offers, indications of interest,
term sheets, or other material agreements, as contemplated above) on a prompt
basis. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ will be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) (A) withhold
or withdraw or publicly propose to withdraw or withhold the Company Board

business on the earlier of (i) the tenth (10th) business day after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act and (ii) the second (2nd) business day prior to the
date of the Company Shareholders Meeting (if such tender or exchange offer is

after the fourth (4th) business day prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting), or (F) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) business days after receipt of a written request by Parent to
make such public reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company of
a public Takeover Proposal (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal in
the form of a tender offer or exchange offer, which shall be governed by
clause (E)) that has not been withdrawn; _provided_ that Parent may make any
such request only once in any ten (10) business day period and only once for
each such public Takeover Proposal and once for each public material amendment
to such Takeover Proposal (any prohibited action described in this clause (x)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (y)
authorize, cause, or permit or publicly propose to authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of

Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_) (each, a " _Company

abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the Company Board may:

 

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
and

 

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn, if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_,
pay the Company Termination Fee, and enter into a definitive agreement to
implement such Superior Proposal;

 

 _provided_ that the Company has complied in all material respects with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and has given Parent at least four (4) business days
(the " _Change of Recommendation Notice Period_ ") written notice (a "
_Company Notice_ ") prior to taking any such action, which notice shall
include a statement that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor and (I) in the case of an Intervening Event,
specifies the material changes, developments, effects, circumstances, states
of facts, or events comprising such Intervening Event, and (II) in the case

such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Superior Proposal and its or their financing sources,
if applicable, and (2) a copy of the most current version of the Company
Acquisition Agreement (if any) with respect to such Superior Proposal and any
agreement in the Companys possession relating to the financing of such

 (X) during such Change of Recommendation Notice Period (it being understood
and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of a Superior Proposal shall require an additional Company Notice
to Parent and an additional two (2) business day period prior to taking any
specified action), the Company shall have, and shall have caused its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
commercially reasonable adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company Board to no longer make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or a determination that a Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (Y) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith following the end of such Change of Recommendation
Notice Period (as it may be extended pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.02(d)_), after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Company Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal or (ii)
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the
applicable Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from
(i) taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
or communication to shareholders of the Company that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is required by the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or otherwise by applicable Law, it being
understood, however, that this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any
of the actions referred to in clause (y) of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_, except,
in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_, or (iii)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

(f) As used in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, "group" has the meaning ascribed
to it in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.03  _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent as
reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare the Proxy Statement and
file it with the SEC. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company Board
shall make the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of Company Shares
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received
from the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement, if and
to the extent such information shall have become false or misleading in any

 



72

    

 material respect. Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the other
promptly in writing after the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all
written correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any
such comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Shares, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response, which the Company shall
consider in good faith.

(b) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_, the Company shall take all
necessary actions, including in accordance with applicable Law, the Company
Organizational Documents, and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, to
duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold a meeting of its shareholders
(including any adjournment, recess, reconvening, or postponement thereof, the
" _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining approval of
the Bye-Law Amendment and Company Shareholder Approval, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) the Company Board of Directors making an Adverse
Recommendation Change. The Bye-Law Amendment proposal shall appear first on
the proxy card in the Proxy Statement ahead of the proposals to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall not include in the Proxy
Statement any proposal to vote upon or consider any Takeover Proposal. Subject
to _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain approval of the Bye-Law Amendment and the Company Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without Parents consent, adjourn, recess,
reconvene, or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting, if after reasonable
consultation with Parent, the Company reasonably believes that (i) such
adjournment, recess, reconvening, or postponement is necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
holders of Company Shares within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), (A) there will be an insufficient number of Company Shares present
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (B) there will be an
insufficient number of proxies to obtain approval of the Bye-Law Amendment or
the Company Shareholder Approval or (iii) such adjournment, recess,
reconvening or postponement is required by Law or a court or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in connection with any
Actions in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or has been
requested by the SEC or its staff. The Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting once, for a period of up to fourteen (14) days,
if

 



73

    

 requested by Parent (in Parents sole discretion) to permit additional time
to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval, if sufficient proxies
constituting the Company Shareholder Approval have not been received by the
Company. If requested by Parent, the Company shall advise Parent at least on a
daily basis on each of the last seven (7) days prior to the date of the
Company Shareholders Meeting (and any reconvening thereof) as to the
aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Shareholder Approval and whether such proxies have been voted affirmatively or
negatively with respect to each of the proposals to be presented at the
Company Shareholders Meeting.

the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement, no party shall be
obligated to provide information to another party, if such party determines,
in its reasonable judgment, that (i) doing so would violate applicable Law or
a Contract, agreement, privilege or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or
expose such party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information (it being understood that the parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enable such
information to be furnished or made available to the requesting party or its
Representatives without so jeopardizing privilege or protection, incurring

obligation, including by entering into a customary joint defense agreement or
common interest agreement with the requesting party, to the extent such an
agreement would preserve the applicable privilege or protection) or (ii) such
information is not directly related to the Transactions. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(d)_ (except for the immediately preceding
sentence) shall not apply with respect to Tax matters.

no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (and in no event
shall the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company without the prior written
consent of Parent agree to) take or refrain from taking, or agree to take or
refrain from taking, any action, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate order, or other arrangement, or permit or suffer to exist any
condition, limitation, restriction or requirement (i) that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, or financial condition of

 



76

    

(A) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) Parent or any
of its Affiliates ( _provided_ that, for this purpose, that the business and
the financial condition, results of operations and other financial metrics of
Parent or any of its Affiliates that is of a smaller scale than the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be of the same
scale as those of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii)
relating to the contribution of capital, or any guaranty, keep-well, capital
maintenance or similar arrangement, by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any restrictions on dividends or distributions that, in any
case, has or would reasonably be expected to have a non- _de minimis _
adverse economic impact on Parent or any of its Affiliates or (iii) that
requires or involves any adverse deviation in any material respect from any
key term of the Summary Business Plan with respect to the Company and the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger identified in
Section 6.04(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (any such requirement,
individually or together with all other such requirements, a " _Parent
Burdensome Condition_ "). Except as approved by Parent, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make or agree to any
concessions with a Governmental Authority in order to obtain the approvals set
forth in _Schedule I_. Prior to Parent being entitled to invoke a Parent
Burdensome Condition, the parties and their respective Representatives shall
promptly confer in good faith in order to (i) exchange and review their
respective views and positions as to any Parent Burdensome Condition or
potential Parent Burdensome Condition and (ii) discuss and present to, and
engage with, the applicable Governmental Authority regarding any approaches or
actions that would avoid the imposition of a Parent Burdensome Condition
or mitigate its impact so that it is no longer a Parent Burdensome Condition.

(g) If requested by Parent, (i) the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in preparing and implementing a communications strategy with respect to
Producers, reinsurers and other Persons with material relationships with the
Company and (ii) the parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and
approvals under any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party in order to avoid any breach or loss of any right thereunder by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any right of termination by any
counterparty thereto arising solely as a result of the entry into this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) make
any concessions to any such Persons in connection with their efforts to obtain
such consents and approvals, (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
be required to make any concessions to the counterparty to such Contracts that
would result in any of them incurring any cost or making any payment in
connection with obtaining any such consent (unless Parent agrees to make such
payment or incur such cost on behalf of the Company or to indemnify the
Company therefore, or such payment or cost is not required to be paid or
incurred until after the Effective Time), (C) the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to agree to take or enter into any action that is not
conditioned upon the Closing, and (D) Parent shall not be required to agree to
make any concessions to the counterparty to any such Contract (unless Parent
agrees to make any payments in connection with such concessions on behalf of
the Company or to indemnify the Company therefore, or such concessions would
not be effective until after the Effective Time).

Section 6.05 _Transfer Taxes_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, all share
transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other
similar Taxes (including interest, penalties, and additions to any such Taxes)
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be
paid by Parent or the Surviving Company, and, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent in preparing, executing, and filing any
applicable Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not (and shall not cause or permit their
respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to) issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except (i) as
may be required by applicable Law, court process, or the rules and regulations
of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system,
(ii) as otherwise explicitly provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, or (iii) to
enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement. The parties agree that
the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions
following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed
to by the parties. The Company shall not make any internal announcements or
other communications to its employees, customers, brokers or reinsurance
providers with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without Parents
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company
may make any oral or written public or internal announcements, releases or
statements without complying with the foregoing requirements, if the substance
of such announcements, releases or statements, was publicly or internally
disclosed and previously subject to the foregoing requirements.

Section 6.07 _Access to Information_. Subject to applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts, and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parents
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities, and properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information, if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing
so could violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality
owing to a third party, waive the protection of an attorney-client privilege
or other legal privilege, or expose the Company to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and
the basis for such withholding and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to enable such information to be furnished or made available to the
requesting party or its Representatives without so jeopardizing privilege or
protection, incurring liability, or contravening applicable Law or Contract or
obligation, including by entering into a customary joint defense agreement or
common interest agreement with the requesting party, to the extent such an
agreement would

 



78

    

preserve the applicable privilege or protection. All requests for information
made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ shall be directed to the Person
designated by the Company. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, except as
required by applicable Law, the Company shall cause its applicable officers
and employees, including its Chief Financial Officer and Head of Reinsurance,
to meet (which may be by electronic means) on a regular basis, and in any
event no less than weekly, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the
Designated Representative, with representatives of Parent and its Affiliates
designated by Parent (the " _Designated Representatives_ ") to discuss the
Companys ceded reinsurance plan for 2019 and future periods. Among other
things, the Company and the Designated Representatives will cooperate and
consider in good faith modifications to the Companys 2019
reinsurance program that may result in a different overall mix of reinsurance
protection than in past periods, with a focus on downside protection with
greater emphasis on excess of loss and catastrophe coverage and less overall
emphasis on quota-share reinsurance. The Company shall consult with, and
consider in good faith any recommendations of, the Designated Representatives
in regard to the development of the overall reinsurance plan for the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as well as on any determination to enter into, renew
and modify any Ceded Reinsurance Contract.

Section 6.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company,
or any other Person in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns any
equity interests at the request of the Company (each, together with such
Persons heirs, executors and administrators, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise), and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was
a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director,
officer, employee, or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee, or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole
or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_
that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any liability that by virtue
of any rule of law attaches to such Indemnitee in respect of any fraud or
dishonesty of which such Indemnitee is guilty in relation to the Company, as
finally determined by the Supreme Court of Bermuda; and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of
expenses) as provided

 



79

    

in the Company Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of
such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any
agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for
indemnification between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the memorandum of association
and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, advancement of expenses and indemnification than are set forth as of
the date of this Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees, except as amendments may be
required by applicable Law during such period.

 

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
financial strength of the Companys current carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnitees on terms and scope
with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual premium for such
insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium (such 300%
threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), which Maximum Premium is set forth in
Section 6.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, then Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an
aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six (6)
years, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing at
least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail" policy has
been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08(b)_ and the Surviving
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of
its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs, and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by
Contract, or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
_Section_ __ _ 6.08_ applies, unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_).

 



80

    

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or
entity of such consolidation, amalgamation, or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall
release, waive, or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers, or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

Section 6.09 _Rule 16b-_ _3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the end of the calendar year
following the year in which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") with a base salary or wage rate, target annual incentive
compensation opportunity and other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding special, one-time or transaction-based compensation and benefits,
defined benefit plan benefits, retiree welfare and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities) that are not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to provide, each Company Employee whose employment
is terminated by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates during the Continuation Period (other than for cause)with severance
benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those set forth on
Section 6.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to, honor and continue all of the Companys employment, severance, retention,
termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as set forth
in Section 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event), subject, in each case, to the terms and
conditions of such arrangements including any provisions related to amendment,
modification, termination and discontinuance.

 



81

    

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off and severance
plans) in which Company Employees are first eligible to participate following
the Effective Time (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Company
Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of
all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt such service need not be recognized for purposes of any retiree health
or welfare arrangements, any frozen benefit plan, benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any New
Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which Company Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to such New Benefit
Plans, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) prior to the Effective Time during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or term of similar
import) that relates to the Company, the occurrence of the Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (or such
term of similar import) of the Company under such Company Plan.

(f) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parents obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 6.10_ shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable
Law of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Company Employee primarily performs his duties.

 



82

    

(g) Company shall provide an accurate and complete list upon the Closing of
each Company Employee whose employment with the Company terminated within the
ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, stating for each such employee the
date of termination, the employees position and work location, and whether
such termination was voluntary or involuntary, and if involuntary, whether it
was for cause.

(h) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or
an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise
and, except as otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates from, after the Effective Time, (i) amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans in accordance with their terms or (ii) terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.

 

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_. During
the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any Actions
commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party which
relates to this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, or the Transactions
and such party shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any
such Action. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give
due consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Action and shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parents sole cost and expense,
in the defense and settlement of any such Action, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.12  _Merger Sub Shareholder Approval_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving this Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement, and the Merger (the " _Merger Sub Shareholder
Approval_ ").

 

Section 6.13 _Client Consents_. The Company shall, or shall cause the IA
Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
(which consent may take the form of negative consent, to the extent written
consent is not required by such Clients Advisory Contract or, if the Client
is a Private Fund, the Private Funds Organizational Documents) of each
Client to the deemed assignment of such Clients Advisory Contract in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Advisory Client
Consents_ "). In connection with obtaining the Advisory Client Consents, (a)
the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status of obtaining such Advisory Client Consents and such other actions
and, upon Parents request, make available to Parent copies of all such
executed Advisory Client Consents and other records relating to the Advisory
Client Consent process and (b) Parent shall have the right to review in
advance of distribution the general forms of any notices or other materials to
be distributed by the IA Subsidiary to Clients (or, if the Client is a
Private Fund, any limited partner, member or beneficial owner of the Private
Fund) and shall have the right to have its reasonable comments considered by
the Company in a commercially reasonable manner prior to distribution.

 



83

    

Section 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective advisors, legal counsel,
accountants, and representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide,
such reasonable cooperation ( _provided_ that, in each case, the requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries) that is customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) assist in preparation for and participate in marketing efforts and lender
presentations in connection with the Debt Financing at reasonable times and
locations mutually agreed;

(ii) assist Parent with the preparation by Parent and the Debt Financing
Sources of bank information memoranda and similar marketing documents required
in connection with the Debt Financing, including the execution and delivery of
customary representation letters in connection with bank
information memoranda;

(iii) cooperate reasonably with the Debt Financing Sources due diligence, to
the extent customary and reasonable;

(iv) execute and deliver as of (but not prior to) the Closing any pledge and
security documents, account control agreements, mortgages, other definitive
financing documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer (or other comparable officer) of
the Company with respect to solvency matters after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby) ( _provided_ that, other than with respect
to any customary representation letters referred to in clause (ii) above, (A)
none of the documents or certificates shall be executed or delivered, except
in connection with the Closing, and (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the Closing)
and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging of collateral and the
granting of security interests in respect of the Debt Financing; and

 

(v) provide all documentation and other information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably required under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act,
to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



84

    

(b) In connection with such cooperation, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) pay any commitment or similar fee in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing Date or bear or
reimburse any costs or expenses or make any payment to obtain consent or to
incur any other actual or potential liability or cause or permit any Lien to
be placed on any of its assets in connection with the Debt Financing prior to
Closing, in each case, for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is
not otherwise fully indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (ii) become an
issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing, unless and until
the Closing occurs, or (iii) execute or deliver, or take any corporate or
other action to adopt or approve, any document, agreement, certificate or
instrument with respect to the Financing that will be effective before the
Closing Date. Parent shall, promptly, upon written request by the Company,
reimburse the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs, and expenses
incurred by any the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives (including those of their accounting firms engaged to assist
in connection with the Debt Financing and legal counsel) in connection with
the cooperation required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective representatives from and against all losses, damages, claims,
costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) suffered or incurred
by any of them directly or indirectly in connection with such Person
complying with their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ and any
information used in connection therewith.

 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos solely in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that
such logos are used solely in a manner that would not harm or disparage the
Company or the Companys reputation, goodwill or marks and will comply with
the Companys reasonable usage requirements.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would (i) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement
(unless, in each case, waived by Parent), (ii) require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or take any
action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under any of their respective Organizational Documents,
any applicable Laws or the Existing Debt Documents or (iii) result in any
officer, director employee, agent or other representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability (as opposed to
liability in his or her capacity as officer) with respect to any matters
relating to the Debt Financing.

Section 6.15 _Existing Indebtedness_. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in
taking such actions as are necessary under (x) the indentures listed in item
(iii) of Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter and (y) the credit
agreements listed in Section 4.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(collectively, " _Existing Debt Documents_ ") in respect of the Transactions,
including delivering or causing a Subsidiary to deliver any such notices,
agreements, documents, or instruments necessary, proper, or advisable to
comply with the terms thereof, including the delivery of any officer
certificates and opinions of counsel required to be delivered thereunder
in connection with the Transactions. If and to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in either (a) arranging for the
termination of Existing Debt Documents (or redemption of the relevant notes
or

 



85

    

debentures) at the Closing (or such other date thereafter as agreed to by
Parent and the Company), which redemption shall be the sole responsibility of
Parent, and the procurement of customary payoff letters and other customary
release documentation in connection therewith (including with respect to the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility) or (b) obtaining any consents required
under any Existing Debt Documents to permit the consummation of the
Transactions thereunder and obtaining any amendments to or other consents
under the Existing Debt Documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
and in each case, if reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver such customary notices,
agreements, documents, or instruments necessary in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company be required in connection with its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ to (i) incur or agree to incur
any out-of-pocket expenses, unless they are promptly reimbursed by Parent,
(ii) incur or agree to incur any commitment, tender, consent, amendment fee or
any fee similar to any of the foregoing, unless Parent provides the funding
to the Company therefor, (iii) amend or agree to amend any Existing Debt
Document, which amendment is not conditioned on the Closing, (iv) incur any
liability in connection therewith prior to the Closing Date, unless
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (v) take any action that would
unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disrupt the normal operations and
management of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (vi) take any action that the
Company reasonably believes could (A) violate its or its Subsidiaries
certificate of incorporation or bye-laws (or comparable documents), (B)
violate any applicable Law, (C) constitute a default or violation under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of any
right or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any
benefit to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any Contract, or (D) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (vii) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement, (viii) take any action that could reasonably be
expected to cause any representation or warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement to be breached or to cause any condition to the Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement, (ix) provide access to or disclose information that the Company
determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (x) fund any repayment, redemption, cash
collateralization, or provide any "backstop" letters of credit prior to the
Closing, or (xi) result in any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
Representatives incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. Parent shall defend, indemnify, and
hold harmless the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, and any of their
respective Representatives from, against, and in respect of any and all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs, and
expenses (including fees of legal counsel) resulting from or incurred in
connection with the cooperation hereunder or any information utilized

Section 6.16 _Equity Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, prior to the
Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
and obtain the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter no later than the date that the Closing is required
to occur in accordance with _Article II_ , including using reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in full force and effect the Equity Commitment
Letter; (ii) satisfy all conditions to the funding of the Equity Commitment
Letter that are within its control; (iii) comply on a timely basis with its
obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter; (iv) consummate the Equity
Financing at or prior to the date that the Closing is required to occur in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06_; and (v) enforce its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter. Nothing in this Agreement shall require, and in no
event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to seek the Equity Financing
from any source other than the Investors counterparty to, or in any amount in
excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit
any amendment or modification to be made to or waiver of any rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) nothing herein
shall prohibit or prevent Parent from exercising any of its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company, including the
right to assign any of its rights or obligations thereunder in
accordance with the terms thereof, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the assignment by any Investor of any of its rights or obligations
under the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub may enter discussions
regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements relating to the
Equity Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in respect of any
such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are met: (i) the
aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii) the arrangements
and agreements, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing; (iii) the arrangements and
agreements would not diminish or release the pre-Closing obligations of the
parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, adversely affect the rights of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Equity Commitment Letter, or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of
Parents or Merger Subs rights under the Equity Commitment Letter; and (iv)
no such additional equity provider would (A) acquire ten percent (10%) or more
of the equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) be
granted a right to designate any member of the board of directors or
other governing body of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon the
consummation of the Equity Financing to Parent, in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter, Parent shall draw down at Closing such amount of such
Equity Financing as is required to make the full amount of payments it is
required to make pursuant to _Article III_.

Section 6.17 _Ratings_. Subject to the other rights and terms of this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its
control persons under applicable Law not to, knowingly take any action or
knowingly fail to take any action with respect to the Transactions or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that Parent, acting reasonably and assuming
due consideration of the matter, believes is reasonably likely to result in a
downgrade by A.M. Best or SandP of the financial strength ratings of the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries. Parent shall ensure that all of the actions
taken by it or any of its control persons under applicable Law, or on behalf
of any of them, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Transactions, will be consistent with the Summary Business Plan.

Section 6.18 _Net CAT Losses_.

 

(a) If, as of any time on or prior to March 3, 2019, one or more CAT Events
has occurred during the Measurement Period and Parent, acting in accordance
with the Agreed Standard, believes that Net CAT Losses arising from such CAT
Events exceed the Specified Amount, then Parent may initiate the procedures
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ to determine the amount of Net CAT
Losses by delivering a written notice to such effect to the Company. If Parent
validly exercises its right to initiate such procedures pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_ (the " _Determination Right_ "), then the parties shall
comply with the procedures set forth in clause (b) of _Section_ __ _ 6.18_
below. Parent may not exercise the Determination Right more than once, and may
not exercise the Determination Right after March 3, 2019. If the
Determination Right has been exercised, then the Closing will not occur until
the Loss Report (as defined below) has been finally determined pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_. If, after the Loss Report (as defined below) has
been finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, all conditions
to the Closing have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), then, unless the
parties otherwise agree in writing, the Closing will occur on the
15th business day after the date on which the Loss Report is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_.

(b) 

(i) If Parent exercises the Determination Right in accordance with Section
6.18(a) above, then the Company, acting in accordance with the Agreed
Standard, shall within five Business Days after the Determination Right has
been exercised deliver to Parent a written report (the " _Loss Report_ ")
setting forth the Companys reasonable and good faith estimated calculation
of Net CAT Losses as of the end of the month immediately preceding the month
in which the Determination Right was exercised. In all cases, the amounts set
forth on the Loss Report shall be determined, and the calculation of Net CAT
Losses as reflected therein shall be made, in accordance with Applicable SAP
and the Companys historical practice for setting reserves and determining
similar amounts.

 

(ii) Parent shall have ten business days to review the Loss Report and the
calculations set forth therein (the " _Review Period_ "). In furtherance of
such review, the Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives with
such reasonable access to the employees and Representatives of the Company,
and to such documentation, records and other information of the Company
relating to the information set forth on the Loss Report, as Parent may
reasonably request.

(iii) If Parent, acting in accordance with the Agreed Standard (and based on
then available information), disagrees with the Companys Loss Report
(including any amount or computation set forth therein) on the basis that the
Loss Report is inaccurate and that, if the Loss Report were accurate, Net CAT
Losses as reflected on

 



88

    

such Loss Report would be greater than the Specified Amount, Parent may, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the Company
setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the
basis for Parents disagreement therewith (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The
Dispute Notice shall set forth, with respect to each disputed item, Parents
position as to the correct amount or computation that should have been
included in the Loss Report.

 

(iv) If no Dispute Notice is received by the Company with respect to any item
in the Loss Report on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the
amount or computation with respect to such items as set forth in the Loss
Report shall be deemed accepted by Parent, whereupon the amount or computation
of such item or items shall be final and binding on the parties.

 

(v) For a period of ten business days beginning on the date that the Company
receives a Dispute Notice, if any, the Company and the Parent, each acting in
accordance with the Agreed Standard, shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
by mutual agreement all matters identified in the Dispute Notice. In the event
that the parties are unable to resolve by mutual agreement any matter in the
Dispute Notice within such two business-day period, the Company and Parent
shall jointly engage a mutually agreeable independent nationally recognized
third party actuarial or accounting firm (the " _Independent Actuary_ ") to
resolve the dispute.

(vi) Parent and the Company will direct the Independent Actuary to render a
determination within fifteen business days after its retention, and Parent,
the Company and their respective employees and Representatives will cooperate
with the Independent Actuary, as applicable, during its engagement. the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly (and
in any event within three business days) after the Independent Actuarys
engagement, as applicable, each submit to the Independent Actuary their
respective computations of the disputed items identified in the Dispute Notice
and information, arguments and support for their respective positions, and
shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the other party. Each
party shall then be given an opportunity to supplement the information,
arguments and support included in its initial submission with one additional
submission to respond to any arguments or positions taken by the other party
in such other partys initial submission, which supplemental information
shall be submitted to the Independent Actuary (with a copy thereof to the
other party) within five business days after the first date on which both
parties have submitted their respective initial submissions to the
Independent Actuary. The Independent Actuary, as applicable, shall thereafter
be permitted to request additional or clarifying information from the parties,
and each of the parties shall cooperate and shall cause their Representatives
to cooperate with such requests of the Independent Actuary. The Independent
Actuary, as applicable, shall determine, based solely on the materials so
presented by the parties and upon information received in response to such
requests for additional or clarifying information and not by independent
review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute
Notice and shall render a written report to Parent and the Company (each, an "
_Actuary Report_ ") in which the Independent Actuary, as applicable shall,
after considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the amounts and computations set forth
in the Loss Report. 

 



89

    

(vii) The Actuary Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail,
the Independent Actuarys determination with respect to each of the disputed
items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any,
to be made to the Loss Report, together with supporting calculations. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Actuary (i) shall be bound to
the principles of this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ and the terms of this Agreement
(including that the amounts set forth in the Loss Report shall be determined
in accordance with the Agreed Standard, Applicable SAP and the Companys
historical practice for setting reserves and similar amounts; provided that
the Independent Actuary may also review whether the amounts set forth on the
Loss Report are reasonable based on industry practice and the nature of and
circumstances surrounding any particular CAT Event or CAT Events), but (ii)
shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice
and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either party.

 

(viii) All fees and expenses relating to the work of the Independent Actuary
shall be paid by the party (that is, the Company or Parent) whose position
with respect to the matter in dispute is furthest from the Independent
Actuarys final determination.

consummates such Takeover Proposal (whether or not within such twelve (12)
month period), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds upon the earlier of the
consummation of the Takeover Proposal or the entry into a definitive agreement
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(ii)_, the references to "10%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or
its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds simultaneously with such
termination;

 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(c)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or
its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) business days
after such termination; or

 

(v) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (A) _ Section_ __
_ 8.01(d)(i)_ as a result of a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
their respective obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ and at the time of
such termination the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Sections 7.01(a)_
, _7.02(a)_ ,  _7.02(b)_ and _7.02(d)_ and, other than with respect to the
Required Regulatory Approvals required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub,
_Sections 7.01(b)_ and _7.01(c)_ , have been satisfied or would have been
satisfied if the Closing had occurred on such date of termination or (B) _
Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(iii)_, Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to
the Company or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)
business days after such termination.

 



96

    

In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
more than once. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee more than once.

(b) Each of the parties acknowledges and hereby agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, and, in
order to obtain the payment, the other party commences an Action that results
in a judgment against the non-paying party for the payment set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_, the non-paying party shall pay the other party for its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date such payment was actually received, subject in all respects to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_. Each of the parties
acknowledge and hereby agrees that each of the Parent Termination Fee and the
Company Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as, and when required pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, shall not constitute a penalty but will be
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party
receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, but subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.08_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ (including, in each case, the
limitations set forth therein), if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the
Closing when required by _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ for any or no reason or
otherwise breaches this Agreement or any Transaction Document (whether such
breach is intentional, unintentional, willful (including a Willful Breach) or
otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder or thereunder or fails to perform any
obligation under Law (in each case, whether such failure is intentional,
unintentional, willful (including a Willful Breach) or otherwise), then the
Companys right to seek (but never receive more than one of) (i) a decree or
order of specific performance or any injunction or injunctions or other
equitable relief if and to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 9.08_ to
cause the Merger Consideration to be paid and the Closing to occur, (ii)
terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ and seek monetary
damages solely on the basis of actual, knowing fraud by Parent or Merger Sub
with the intent to deceive or mislead the Company, regarding Parents or
Merger Subs representations and warranties (subject in all respects to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_) and (iii) terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(iii)_ and if, as, and when
required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(v)_, receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, and, subject to the limitation set forth in _clause
(B)_ of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_, the costs and expenses of the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, and the reimbursement obligations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ __ and the
obligations to pay fees and expenses of the Independent Actuary pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_, be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at Law, in
equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company Related Parties,
Representatives of the Company and any other person against the Parent
Related Parties for any breach, liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or
damage suffered as a result thereof or in connection therewith or related
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances can
the Company receive more than one of the three remedies set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) of the previous sentence.

 



97

    

(d) Except (i) as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(c)_ or (ii) claims, if
any, against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement, no Parent Related Party will
have any liability or obligation to the Company Related Parties,
the Representatives of the Company, or any other Person, including any
multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary, or punitive
damages, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or any documents or certificates referenced herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any breach of any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein or therein, or the
failure of such transactions to be consummated, or, in respect of any other
Contract, document, or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort, or otherwise.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties nor any of their former, current, and future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, or
assignees shall have any liability or obligation to the Company Related
Parties, the Representatives of the Company, or any other Person arising out
of their breach or failure to perform (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) any of their obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letters. Without limiting the foregoing, upon payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, if, as, and when required pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.03(a)(v)_ and the amounts, if any, as and when due pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.03(b)_, no Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation to the Company Related Parties, the Representatives of the Company,
or any other Person, including any multiple, consequential, indirect,
special, statutory, exemplary, or punitive damages, relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, or any other documents
referenced herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or in respect of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained
herein or therein, or the failure of such transactions to be consummated, or
in respect of any other Contract, document, or theory of Law or equity or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort, or
otherwise.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document, or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, the maximum aggregate liability
of the Parent Related Parties under the Transaction Documents or otherwise,
collectively (including monetary damages for breach, whether willful,
intentional, unintentional, or otherwise, or monetary damages in lieu of
specific performance), or in connection with the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Financing) to be consummated, or
in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in
tort or otherwise, together with any payment of the Parent Termination Fee and
any other payment in connection with any Transaction Document or otherwise,
shall not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
Parent Termination Fee, if any, due and owing to the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(v)_, plus (ii) the amounts, if any, due

 



98

    

and owing to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_ and as a result
of the reimbursement obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ and the obligations to pay fees and expenses of the
Independent Actuary pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.18_;  _provided_ that (A)
in no event shall the aggregate amount of Parents obligations described in
clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_ together with the aggregate amount
of Parents obligations described in clause (b) of _Section_ __ _ 8.02_
exceed the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and (B) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Parents obligations described in clause (ii) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_ exceed $1,500,000, and in no event shall the Company
Related Parties and the Representatives of the Company seek, directly or
indirectly, to recover against the Parent Related Parties, or compel payment
by the Parent Related Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever
(including multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or
punitive damages) in excess of the Parent Termination Fee or any of the
foregoing limitations (as applicable); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing shall not apply to claims, if
any, against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

ARTICLE IX.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.01 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. This _Article
IX_ and the agreements of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub contained in
_Article III_ , _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall survive
the Effective Time. No other representations, warranties, obligations or
agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

Section 9.02 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties, by action taken by the Parent Board and the
Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) following receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by applicable Law would require further approval by
the shareholders of the Company without such approval and (b) any
modification or amendment of _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ (solely to the extent that
it relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties), clause (b) of this
proviso of _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, clause (iv) of _Section_ __ _ 9.06_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.07(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ (solely to the extent that it
relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties),  _Section_ __ _
9.13_ (solely to the extent that it relates to the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties) and the definitions of Debt Commitment Letter, Debt
Financing, Debt Financing Sources, and Debt Financing Sources Related Parties
that is adverse to the interests of the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties
will not be effective against the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 

Section 9.03 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party, or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as

 



99

    

otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys conditions (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by the Company, Parent, or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

Section 9.04 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties. No assignment by any party shall relieve
such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately
preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall be null and void.

Section 9.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

Section 9.06  _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and
their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person, other
than the parties, any rights or remedies hereunder, except for (i) if the
Effective Time occurs, the right of the holders of Company Shares to receive
the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with _Article III,_ (ii) the
provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ of this Agreement, (iii) from
and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Awards to
receive the payments contemplated by the applicable provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 3.03_ in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
(iv) each Debt Financing Sources Related Party shall be a third-party
beneficiary of _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ (solely to the extent that it relates to
the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties), clause (b) of the proviso of
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_, this clause (iv) of _Section_ __ _ 9.06_,  _Section_
__ _ 9.07(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ (solely to the extent that it relates to
the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties), and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ (solely
to the extent that it relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to recover,
following termination by the Company of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.01(d)(i)_, through an Action brought by the Company, damages from
Parent to the extent arising out of a Willful Breach of this Agreement by
Parent subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.03(e)_, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself
and on behalf of the holders of Company Shares shall be determined by
reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable under the
circumstances of such breach by such holders if all such holders brought an
action against Parent and were recognized as third-party beneficiaries
hereunder. The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in this

 



100

    

Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the
sole benefit of the parties and may, in certain instances, be qualified,
limited or changed by confidential disclosure letters. Any inaccuracies in
such representations or warranties or failure to perform or breach of such
covenants or agreements are subject to waiver by the parties in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In
some instances, the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risk
associated with particular matters, regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties. Consequently, Persons, other than the parties, may not rely upon the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.07  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to
the extent the provisions of the laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable
to the Merger.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be
brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts
within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and,
in each case, any appellate court therefrom. The parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
Actions and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of
jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.07(b)_ shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose, except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties.
Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is
given by overnight courier at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
of this Agreement. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict
any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal
from, a final trial court judgment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
9.07_, each party to this Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i)
that any legal action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Sources Related Party arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable

 



101

    

Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof), (ii) that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of
any provisions in this Agreement and/or the Equity Commitment Letter, any
legal action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Sources Related Party shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, (iii)
not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring any such legal action
in any other court, and (iv) that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
9.07(c)_ shall apply to any such legal action.

 

Section 9.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties fail to take any action required of them hereunder
to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.07(b)_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is
an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 9.08_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date
(or following the Walk-Away Date if, (i) in the case of the Company, the
termination right in  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_ is unavailable to Parent or
(ii) in the case of Parent, the termination right in _Section_ __ _
8.01(b)(i)_ is unavailable to the Company), any party brings any action, in
each case, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, or any party brings any action (whether in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.08_ or otherwise) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_, or initiates any procedure to resolve disputes with
respect to the Loss Report as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, the
Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period during which
such action is pending, _plus_ ten (10) business days or (y) by such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case
may be. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and for the avoidance
of doubt, subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, _Section_ __
_ 8.02_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ (and, in each
case, the limitations set forth herein or therein), any and all remedies
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by
applicable Law on such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary in any Transaction Document or otherwise, for the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may,

 



102

    

subject in all respects to _Section_ __ _ 8.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, concurrently seek (A) specific performance or
other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_,
and (B) payment of monetary damages pursuant to clause (b) of _Section_ __ _
8.02_ or the Parent Termination Fee, if, as, and when required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(v)_, under no circumstances shall the Company,
directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (1) both a grant
of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether
under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable
relief to cause the Merger Consideration to be paid and the Closing to occur,
on the one hand, and payment of any monetary damages whatsoever and/or the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (2) both payment
of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of
the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein or
otherwise to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent has
an obligation hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, including
by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and such
obligation of Parent, and the right of the Company to specific performance in
connection with enforcing such obligation of Parent (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter), and the obligation of Parent to
consummate the Merger, will be subject to the requirements that (I) all of the
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ have
been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and that would be satisfied
if there were a Closing at such time); (II) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06_;
and (III) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to
Parent that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is
funded, then the Company would take such actions that are required of it by
this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur (and the Company has not revoked,
withdrawn, modified, or conditioned such irrevocable confirmation), and
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within three (3) business
days after delivery of the Companys irrevocable written confirmation.

 

Section 9.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.09_.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term, condition, or other provision of
this Agreement is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that
any term, condition, or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced, the parties shall negotiate to attempt to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
