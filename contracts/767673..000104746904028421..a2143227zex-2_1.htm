 Section 2.6 _ Withholding._ Raven, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, the Treasury Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. The Parties currently anticipate the following types of withholding: (i) withholding of income and employment taxes against payments made in respect of Options and (ii) backup withholding under Section 3406 of the Code against payments to Persons failing to provide appropriate evidence establishing that such backup withholding is not required. Without limiting its rights to withhold under this _Section 2.6_, Raven agrees to provide advance notice to the Stockholder Representative, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, of the general nature of any other type of Tax withholding that Raven determines to be required in respect of payments made to Stockholders under this Agreement and shall allow the Stockholders to provide documentation to minimize or eliminate such withholding. 

  

 Section 2.7 _ Dissenting Shares._ 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Non-Electing Stockholders who have exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable amount pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(ii)_, and an amount equal to the aggregate consideration payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(ii)(A)_ shall be deposited in escrow with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement (the " _Dissenting Shares Consideration_ "). Such Non-Electing Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement; _provided_ that if the Escrow Fund is insufficient to make such payment, then the Surviving Company shall make all necessary payments in excess of the Escrow Fund. All Dissenting Shares held by Non-Electing Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable amount pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(ii)_, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Stock, in the manner provided, and subject to the conditions of, this _Article II_. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Raven (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the opportunity to participate in all material negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal 

  

      

  
  

under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Raven, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

  

  

 Section 2.8 _ Surrender of Shares._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Raven shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Holders, (i) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the cash consideration due to the Holders pursuant to _Sections 2.4(a)(i)(B)_ , _2.4(a)(ii)(A)_ , and _2.4(b)(i)_ , and (ii) the aggregate number of Allocated Raven Shares due to the Electing Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(i)(A)_. The cash so deposited shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Raven or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of the United States of America. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to Raven. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Raven shall cause to be mailed to each Holder a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates; (ii) authorize and acknowledge the appointment of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the provisions of, and the authority granted in, _Section 10.15_; (iii) waive any and all liability of, or claims against, any Raven Indemnified Party (as defined in the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement) for (A) disbursements of the Escrow Fund to the Stockholder Escrow Fund or to any Holder or Holders; (B) disbursement of the Stockholder Escrow Amount; or (C) disbursement of the Accounting Expense Fund pursuant to the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement, and (iv) be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Raven. After the Effective Time, upon surrender, in accordance with this _Section 2.8(b)_, to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor as soon as practicable thereafter the cash and, if applicable, a new certificate or new certificates (the " _New Certificates_ ") representing the number of full shares of Raven Common Stock, in each case, to be received by the Holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company of shares of Company Stock or Options and, if Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4_. If any New Certificate is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to, a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving Company or its transfer agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of New Certificates in, or remittance of cash to, a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4_. 

  

      

  

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Raven Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Raven Common Stock to be received in respect thereof until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the New Certificate or New Certificates representing whole shares of Raven Common Stock issued in connection therewith, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Raven Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Raven Common Stock. 

  

 (d) The consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock and the Options so exchanged. No New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Raven Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (e) At any time following the date which is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Raven shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any Raven Common Stock or funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Raven and the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.4_. The Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Stock and Options for the applicable consideration. 

  

 

ARTICLE III 
 CALCULATION OF MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENTS

  

 Section 3.1 _ Net Working Capital._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Raven Calculations._ As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Raven will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a schedule (the " _Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth Raven\'s calculation of the Net Working Capital. The Adjustment Schedule shall set forth by line item the components of Net Working Capital and shall be accompanied by such detail and supporting schedules as may be necessary, or may be reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative, to verify Raven\'s calculations. 

   

 (b) _ Objections._ If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with Raven\'s calculation of Net Working Capital as shown on the Adjustment Schedule delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, the Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the documents referred to in _Section 3.1(a)_, deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Raven disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth the Stockholder Representative\'s calculation of Net Working Capital. If the Stockholder Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice, the amounts of Net Working Capital shown on the Adjustment Schedule shall be the Final Net Working Capital for all purposes under and pursuant to this Agreement. Any such Objection Notice shall specify those line items in the Adjustment Schedule and the items, amounts, calculations, or valuations used to determine such line items, as to which the Stockholder Representative disagrees. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all line items or amounts contained in the 

  

      

  
  

Adjustment Schedule and all calculations or valuations used in determining
any line item of the Net Working Capital set forth in the Adjustment Schedule
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, unless, and only to the extent
that, such items, amounts, calculations or valuations are specifically
objected to in the Objection Notice.

  

 (c) _ Resolution._ If an Objection Notice is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ Raven and the Stockholder Representative shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts. 

  

 (d) _ Accounting Referee._ If during such period set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_, Raven and the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach a final resolution, Raven and the Stockholder Representative will jointly retain an accounting firm of recognized national standing (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements. If Raven and the Stockholder Representative are unable to agree on the choice of the Accounting Referee, then the Accounting Referee will be chosen by lot by Raven and the Stockholder Representative from between KPMG llp, Grant Thornton llp and BDO Seidman llp in each case using a partner of the New York, NY or Washington, DC office of such firms. Raven and the Stockholder Representative will direct the Accounting Referee to render a determination and to send notice of such determination to Raven and the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.1_ within sixty (60) days of its retention and Raven, the Stockholder Representative, and their respective agents will cooperate with the Accounting Referee during its engagement. The Accounting Referee will consider only those line items and amounts in the Adjustment Schedule set forth in the Objection Notice that Raven and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve. Raven and the Stockholder Representative shall each submit a binder to the Accounting Referee promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) days after the Accounting Referee\'s engagement), which binder shall contain such Party\'s computation of those line items or amounts contained in the Adjustment Schedule about which the parties could not resolve any differences and such Party\'s calculation of Net Working Capital. The Accounting Referee shall review such binders and base its determination solely on them; _provided_ that if a Party fails to submit such a binder, the Accounting Referee shall proceed to determine the Net Working Capital without such binder. In resolving all disputed line items and amounts, the Accounting Referee\'s determination of Net Working Capital may not exceed the amount of Net Working Capital set forth on the Objection Notice and may not be less than the amount of Net Working Capital set forth on the Adjustment Schedule. The Accounting Referee\'s determination will be based on the definition of Net Working Capital set forth in this Agreement. The determination of the Accounting Referee of the Net Working Capital will be conclusive and binding upon the parties and such amounts as determined by the Accounting Referee will be the Final Net Working Capital for all purposes pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _ Expenses._ The Stockholder Representative shall bear a percentage of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee equal to the difference between the aggregate amount contested by the Stockholder Representative set forth on the Objection Notice and amounts actually paid to the Stockholder Representative with respect to contested items, as a percentage of the aggregate amount so contested; _provided_ that the expenses to be borne by the Stockholder Representative shall not exceed the Accounting Expense Amount and shall be disbursed from the Accounting Expense Fund pursuant to the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement. Promptly following the determination of Final Net Working Capital, the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Accounting Expense Fund that portion of the cost and expenses of the Accounting Referee to be borne by the Stockholder Representative and, at the direction of the Stockholder Representative, either distribute any remaining portion of the Accounting Expense Fund to the Holders in accordance with _Exhibit A_ attached to the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement or add such portion to the Stockholder Escrow Fund. Raven shall bear the remainder of such costs and expenses. 

  

      

  
  

 (f) _ Access and Cooperation._ Raven and the Stockholder Representative agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Adjustment Schedule and the calculation of Net Working Capital and in the conduct of the reviews and procedures referred to in this _Section 3.1_, including the making available, to the extent necessary, of books, records, work papers and personnel. 

  

  

 Section 3.2 _ Adjustment to Merger Consideration._ 

  

  

 (a) If there is a Final Net Working Capital Surplus, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section 3.1_, Raven shall deposit into the Escrow Fund, to be held and disbursed pursuant to the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement, an amount equal to the _lesser_ of (i) the Final Net Working Capital Surplus or (ii) if different, the Maximum Surplus Payment. 

  

 (b) If there is a Final Net Working Capital Deficit, there shall be disbursed to Raven from the Escrow Fund within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section 3.1_, the amount of the Final Net Working Capital Deficit. The Stockholder Representative shall promptly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent any certificate or other notice required by the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement to authorize such disbursement to Raven.

Each Cavalier Entity is duly qualified or registered as a foreign corporation to transact business under the Laws of each jurisdiction where the character of its activities or the location of the properties owned or leased by it requires such qualification or registration, except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Raven true, correct and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the other charter documents of the Cavalier Entities as currently in effect and the corporate record books with respect to actions taken by each of its stockholders and board of directors. _Schedule 4.1_ contains a true and correct list of the jurisdictions in which each Cavalier Entity is qualified or registered to do business as a foreign corporation. 

  

 Section 4.2 _ Authorization._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

There have been no amendments to Section 6(h) of the Company\'s 1996 Equity Incentive Plan since the inception of such plan. There are no outstanding contracts or other agreements of any Cavalier Entity, or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any Stockholder or any other Person, to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of any Cavalier Entity, or securities or obligations of any kind convertible into any shares of the capital stock of such Cavalier Entity.

 Section 4.6 _ Real Property._ 

  

  

 (a) _Schedule 4.6(a)_ sets forth a true and correct legal description of the Owned Real Property. A Cavalier Entity other than the Company has good and marketable title to each parcel of the Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. 

  

 (b) _Schedule 4.6(b)_ sets forth a true and correct description of the Leased Real Property. The Company has provided to Raven a true and correct copy of each lease relating to the Leased Real Property. 

  

 (c) The Cavalier Entities have a valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property, and the leases granting such interests are in full force and effect. 

   

 (d) No portion of the Owned Real Property, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property, or any building or improvement located thereon, (i) violates any Law in any material respect, including those Laws relating to zoning, building, land use, environmental, health and safety, fire, air, sanitation and noise control, except where such violation would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to any Lien created by, or arising through, a Cavalier Entity, except for the Permitted Liens. Except for the Permitted Liens, no Real Property is subject to (i) any governmental decree or order (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or proposed order) or (ii) any rights of way, building use restrictions, exceptions, 

  

      

  
  

variances, reservations or limitations of any nature whatsoever, except such
of the foregoing as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

 (e) The improvements and fixtures on the Real Property are in good operating condition and in a state of good maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are adequate and suitable for the purposes for which they are presently being used. There is no condemnation, expropriation or similar proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any of the Real Property or any improvement thereon. The Real Property constitutes all of the real property utilized by the Cavalier Entities in the operation of the Business. 

  

  

 Section 4.7 _ Title to Assets; Related Matters._ Each Cavalier Entity has good title to all of its respective tangible personal property and assets, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens. All equipment and other items of tangible personal property and assets of each Cavalier Entity (a) is in good operating condition and in a state of good maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (b) is usable in the regular and ordinary course of business and (c) conforms to all applicable Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, no such equipment or other tangible personal property contains any defect or problem, other than ordinary wear and tear and any defects or problems that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Person other than the Cavalier Entities owns any equipment or other tangible personal property or assets situated on the premises of the Cavalier Entities, except for leased items that are subject to personal property leases. Since December 31, 2003, no Cavalier Entity has sold, transferred or disposed of any assets, other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business. _Schedule 4.7_ sets forth a true, correct and complete list and general description of each item of tangible personal property of the Cavalier Entities having a book value of more than $25,000.

The book value of any such inventory that is excess, obsolete, damaged, or defective does not exceed the reserve for inventory reflected in the inventory line item on the Interim Balance Sheet. The amount at which the inventory of the Cavalier Entities is carried on the Interim Balance Sheet fairly represents, in all material respects, the cost (or market value, if lower) of such inventory as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 Section 4.9 _ Financial Statements._

Each Party shall give prompt notice to the other Parties of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that the occurrence or failure of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Raven, as the case may be, contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date or that shall or may result in the failure to satisfy any condition specified in _Article VII_ and (ii) any failure of the Company or Raven, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them hereunder.

 Section 6.9 _ Tax Matters_. 

  

  

 (a) Raven and the Surviving Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Cavalier Entities (i) for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are due after the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Periods_ ") and (ii) for all Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Cavalier Entities in preparing their Tax Returns unless otherwise required by law. Any such Tax Returns with respect to income Taxes shall be provided to the Stockholder Representative for review and comment not later than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for filing such income Tax Returns (including extensions), and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to suggest to Raven and the Surviving Company any reasonable changes to such Tax Returns. The Stockholder Representative shall provide Raven and the Surviving Company with a written description of the items, if any, in such Tax Returns that it intends to dispute within twenty (20) days following the delivery to it of such Tax Returns. The Stockholder Representative and Raven and the Surviving Company agree to consult and to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10) days following the delivery of any intention to dispute by the Stockholder Representative to Raven and the Surviving Company, the Stockholder Representative and Raven and the Surviving Company shall jointly request the Accounting Referee to resolve any issue in dispute at least five days before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Holders (through the Escrow Amount), on one hand, and Raven and the Surviving Company, on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of the Accounting Referee\'s fees and expenses, and the determination of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on all parties. 

  

      

  

 (b) Solely for the purpose of making the calculation required by _Section 9.1(d)_ of the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of the Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holders shall not be responsible for any Taxes resulting from any action taken by Raven on or subsequent to the Closing Date or the Surviving Company\'s actions on or subsequent to the Closing Date (after the Closing), and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended at the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Cavalier Entities in filing their Tax Returns. At the time that Raven and the Surviving Company provide a copy of any income Tax Return for any Straddle Period to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_, they also shall provide a statement pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b) _calculating the amount of income Taxes allocable to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date. Such statement shall be subject to the same review and dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 6.9(a)_ for the income Tax Return. 

  

 (c) Each of Raven, the Surviving Company and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of any Cavalier Entity. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax Return or to any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding. Raven and the Surviving Company agree (a) to retain all books and records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Cavalier Entities relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the period during which a claim could by made by Raven or the Surviving Company under the Escrow and Indemnity Agreement with respect to any Tax liability related to such period, and (b) to give the Stockholder Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the Stockholder Representative so requests, Raven and the Surviving Company shall allow the Stockholder Representative to take possession of such books and records. 

   

 (d) Neither Raven nor the Surviving Company shall amend any Tax Returns of any Cavalier Entity for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or file a claim for refund of Taxes attributable to a Tax period (or a portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case during any period for which an indemnification claim is available to Raven, without the Stockholder Representative\'s written consent, which shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 (e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Company when due, and the Company will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, Raven will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from the 

  

      

  
  

Escrow Fund in the case of any stock transfer Taxes paid by the Company, to
the extent such stock transfer Taxes are personal liabilities of the
Stockholders under applicable law.

   

 (f) If the Forward Merger is consummated, Raven and the Company agree to treat and report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (and any comparable state or local income tax statute). None of Raven, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would cause the Forward Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 (g) The Parties agree that any federal income Tax deductions attributable to payments made to the Option Holders pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(i)_ shall be treated as relating to the Company\'s last federal income Tax period ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent that such treatment is prohibited as a result of any new Tax Law or any change in Tax Law adopted following the date hereof. 

  

  

 Section 6.10 _ Information Statement._ As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement but in any event no later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (a) promptly prepare an information statement or similar document (the " _Information Statement_ ") (the form and substance of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Raven; _provided_ that Raven shall not unreasonably condition or delay its acceptance of the Information Statement), (b) deliver to the Minority Stockholders such Information Statement together with any other documentation required by Section 228 of the DGCL (the form and substance of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Raven), (c) deliver to the Eligible Stockholders a Stock Election form together with a description of the method for calculating the Allocated Percentage and the procedures for making such an election (which procedures (i) will provide that all Stock Election forms must be completed, executed and returned to Raven by October 4, 2004 and (ii) will be in a form satisfactory to Raven in its sole discretion) and (d) deliver to the Holders such notices as are required in order to describe and facilitate the transactions contemplated hereby (the form and substance of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Raven). 

  

 Section 6.11 _ Interim Financials._ As promptly as practicable following each regular accounting period subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Raven periodic financial reports in the form that the Company customarily prepares for its internal purposes concerning the Company and the Cavalier Entities and, if available, unaudited statements of the financial position of the Company and the Cavalier Entities as of the last day of each accounting period and statements of income and changes in financial position of such entity for the period then ended. The Company covenants that such interim statements shall be prepared on a basis consistent with prior interim periods. 

  

 Section 6.12 _ Tax Representation Letters._ On or before the Closing Date, each of the Company and Raven shall make and will use its best efforts to obtain from its Affiliates such reasonable representations as may be requested by counsel for the purpose of rendering the opinions of counsel referred to in _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that this requirement shall be waived by Raven and the Company if the Reverse Merger is consummated in lieu of the Forward Merger. 

  

 Section 6.13 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification._ It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by the Company now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger, and Raven shall (a) cause the Surviving Company to continue such rights in full force and effect for a period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time and (b) cause the Surviving Company to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Company\'s obligation with respect thereto. 

       

  Section 6.14 _ Termination of Company 401(k) Plan._ The
Company shall, or shall cause each of the Cavalier Entities, to (i) terminate
the Company 401(k) Plan effective immediately prior to the Closing Date and
make all contributions required for periods through such termination
date, (ii) cease all further contributions to the Company 401(k) Plan with
respect to pay periods beginning on and after the Closing Date (other than as
required to repay loans thereunder), and (iii) cease making any additional
loans to participants under the Company 401(k) Plan effective as of the
termination of such Company 401(k) Plan. The Company shall provide written
resolutions reasonably satisfactory to Raven authorizing the foregoing, and a
copy of such resolutions shall be delivered to Raven prior to the Closing
Date.

  

 Section 6.15 _ Options._ The Board of Directors of the Company or such other duly authorized committee thereof shall take all such action necessary to authorize the cancellation of all issued and outstanding Unexercised Options for payment pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.16 _ Board Representation._ At Closing, Raven will take all actions necessary to cause the person set forth on _Schedule 6.16_ to be appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of Raven. If prior to the Effective Time, such individual is unwilling or unable to serve as a director of Raven, the Company shall designate another individual acceptable to the Board of Directors of Raven to serve as a director of Raven. After the Effective Time, if such individual (or any other individual designated in accordance with the preceding sentence) is unwilling or unable to serve on the Board or Directors of Raven the Board of Directors of Raven shall fill any resulting vacancy on the Board of Directors in accordance with the Bylaws of Raven as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. Each such director shall serve until his respective successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.

cancelled, would result in the application of Section 280G of the Code. The
determination of who constitutes a disqualified individual and the form of

taken by the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
and Indemnity Agreement, other than such liabilities, losses, costs, damages

Representative for or be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Escrow

from or relating to breaches by the Company of any Fundamental Company

 (b) arising out of or relating to any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Raven in this Escrow Agreement or the Merger Agreement or in any Raven Ancillary Document; 

   

      

   
  

 (c) arising out of or relating to any claim against Raven based on fraud, intentional misrepresentations, intentional breach or gross negligence in connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, this Escrow Agreement or any Raven Ancillary Document; and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against Raven for indemnification
pursuant to this Escrow Agreement for Stockholder Losses unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Stockholder Losses exceeds the Basket, in which event
the Stockholder Indemnified Parties may claim indemnification for all
Stockholder Losses in excess of the Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Basket shall not apply with respect to any indemnification claim for
Stockholder Losses (i) made pursuant to clause _(c)_ of this _Section 10.2_
 or (ii) resulting from or relating to breaches by Raven of any Fundamental
Raven Representations.

  

 10.3 _ Indemnity Claims Limitations_. 

    

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary, the claims for indemnity made by any Raven Indemnified Party shall be made solely from, and shall be enforceable solely against, the Escrow Fund on hand from time to time; _provided that_ except as provided in _Section 10.1(h)_ of this Escrow Agreement, no claim for indemnification for any Raven Losses shall be satisfied with any portion of the Dissenting Shares Consideration. No Holder shall have any personal liability for any indemnification claim. No Raven Indemnified Party shall have any right to make any indemnification claims following the final distribution of all amounts held in the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (b) Any Raven Indemnified Party may make a claim for Raven Losses pursuant to this Escrow Agreement only if written notice of such losses is given on or prior to the Applicable Limitation Date, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last day of the Applicable Limitation Date, the Stockholder Representative shall have been properly notified, in accordance with _Section 11.1_ of this Escrow Agreement, of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement 

  

 (c) Raven will be liable to the Stockholder Indemnified Parties for Stockholder Losses only if written notice of such losses is given on or prior to the Applicable Limitation Date, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last day of the Applicable Limitation Date, Raven shall have been properly notified, in accordance with _Section 11.1_ of this Escrow Agreement, of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. The aggregate amount of all payments made by Raven for all Stockholder Losses in satisfaction of claims for indemnification by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Escrow Agreement shall not exceed the Escrow Fund (excluding the Dissenting Shares Consideration) on hand from time to time. 

   

      

   
  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.1(h)_ of this Escrow Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate amount paid to the Raven Indemnified Parties for indemnification claims made pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ of this Escrow Agreement shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Dissenting Shares Consideration over the amount disbursed to the Dissenting Shareholders pursuant to _Section 4.4_ of this Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Escrow Agreement to the contrary, Raven shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes with respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date which Taxes are attributable to the inability to utilize net operating losses or other income Tax attributes that are reflected on a Cavalier Entity\'s income Tax Returns filed for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. 

    

 10.4 _ Exclusion to Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Escrow Agreement shall limit any claims (i) Raven has or may have arising from or relating to any fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Company or any Holder in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Escrow Agreement; or (ii) Holders have or may have arising from or relating to any fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith of Raven in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Escrow Agreement or the Merger Agreement. 

  

 10.5 _ Adjustments_. Any indemnity payments made under this Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Net Cash Consideration for Tax purposes. 

  

 10.6 _ Exclusive Remedy_. Other than (i) such rights and remedies as may be provided in the Registration Rights Agreement to Raven and/or the Electing Stockholders parties thereto and (ii) the rights of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 6.13_ of the Merger Agreement, the rights of the Raven Indemnified Parties and the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under this Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Raven Indemnified Parties or the Stockholder Indemnified Parties (as the case may be) with respect to claims described herein or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of the Merger Agreement. 

  

  

 11. _ _ _Indemnification Procedure_. 

  

  

 11.1 _ Notice of Claims._ Promptly after receipt by a Raven Indemnified Party or a Stockholder Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice by a third party (including any Governmental Entity) of any complaint or the commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Party for any Raven Losses or any Stockholder Losses (as the case may be), such Raven Indemnified Party will notify the Stockholder Representative, or such Stockholder Indemnified Party shall notify Raven (as the case may be) (such notified party being the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of receipt of such complaint or of notice of the commencement of such audit, investigation, action or proceeding. If such claim for indemnification does not arise from a complaint, audit, investigation, action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the event or occurrence giving rise to the indemnification claims promptly following the Indemnified Party\'s discovery of such event or occurrence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Escrow Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within fifteen days after receipt of notification with respect to a claim, to assume the defense of the claim, including the employment of counsel 

  

      

  

reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees
and disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the claim on
the terms provided above within such fifteen day period, then such Indemnified
Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such claim and the
Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
counsel as incurred. In any claim with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, will have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Party\'s own
expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
will at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining and to
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such matter.

   

 11.2 _ Settlement_. No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to _Section 11.1_ of this Escrow Agreement or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent (1) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such claim and (2) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim; (ii) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party; and (iii) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term (other than the fact of payment or the amount of such payment) that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party\'s Affiliates. 

  

 11.3 _ Direct Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, such Indemnified Party will send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice will specify the basis for such claim and, if subject to determination or reasonable estimation, the amount of Raven Losses or Stockholder Losses (as the case may be). As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five Business Days following the delivery of the notice of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

 12.5 _ Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc_.

During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this _Section 12.5_ is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim

 (i) use its reasonable efforts to cause all Resale Securities to be listed on any securities exchange on which similar securities issued by Raven are then listed. 

    

 3.2 _ Restrictions_.

 5. _ _ _Indemnification; Contribution_. 

  

  

 5.1 _ Indemnification by Raven_. Raven agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Stockholders: 

    

 (a) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to which any Selling Stockholder may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise (A) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Resale Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

  

 (b) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim 

   

      

   
  

whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or any omission or alleged omission, if such settlement is effected with the
written consent of Raven; and

  

 (c) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3_, against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, in each case whether or not a party, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under _Sections 5.1(a)_ or _5.1(b)_ ; 

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnity provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.1_ shall not (x) apply with respect to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to Raven by any Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Resale
Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or the Resale Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto or (y) inure to the benefit of
any Selling Stockholder from whom any Person asserting any loss, claim,
damage, liability or action of, against or with respect to such Selling
Stockholder resulting from the fact that (1) a copy of the Prospectus
(together with any correcting amendments or supplements) was not sent or given
to such asserting person at, or prior to, the written confirmation of the sale
of such Securities to such Person and (2) the untrue statement in or omission
from any Prospectus (giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action) was corrected in an amendment or supplement thereto delivered to such
Selling Stockholder prior to the date such Selling Stockholder delivered to
such Person a copy of the Resale Prospectus (together with any correcting
amendments or supplements).

  

 5.2 _ Indemnification by the Selling Stockholders_. The Selling Stockholders agree to indemnify and hold harmless Raven, and each of its respective directors and officers (including each director and officer of Raven who signed the Resale Registration Statement), and each Person, if any, who controls Raven within the meaning of _Section 15_ of the Securities Act, to the same extent as the indemnity contained in _Section 5.1_ hereof, but only insofar as such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Resale Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or the Resale Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Raven by the Selling Stockholders expressly for use therein; _provided that_ the liability of each Selling Stockholder hereunder shall be limited to the lower of (i) the proportion of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense which is equal to the proportion that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares sold by such Holder under the Resale Registration Statement bears to the total net proceeds from the sale of all securities sold thereunder and (ii) the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Resale Securities covered by such Resale Registration Statement. 

   

 5.3 _ Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Each indemnified party shall give reasonably prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under the indemnity agreement provided in _Sections 6.1_ or _6.2_ above, unless the lack of notice by the indemnified party materially prejudices the indemnifying party or results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses. After receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party so notified, to assume the defense of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying party\'s own expense with counsel chosen by such indemnifying party and approved by the indemnified party, which approval shall 

  

      

  
  

not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
defendants in any such action or proceeding include both the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party reasonably
determines, based upon advice of counsel, that a conflict of interest exists
or that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified
parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the
indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall be entitled to separate
counsel (which shall be limited to a single law firm), the reasonable fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying
party does not assume the defense of any such action or proceeding, after
having received the notice referred to in the first sentence of this
paragraph, the indemnifying party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel (which shall be limited to a single law firm) for the indemnified
party. In such event, however, the indemnifying party will not be liable for
any settlement effected without the written consent of such indemnifying
party. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any such action or
proceeding in accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying party shall
not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified party
incurred thereafter in connection with such action or proceeding, except as
set forth in the proviso in the second sentence of this _Section 6.3_. 

  

 5.4 _ Contribution_. 

    

 (a) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided for in this _Section 5_ is for any reason held to be unenforceable although applicable in accordance with its terms, Raven and the Selling Stockholders shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement incurred by Raven and the Selling Stockholders, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Raven on the one hand and the Selling Stockholders on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or the indemnified parties, and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ any Selling Stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Resale Securities of such Participating Stockholder were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Participating Stockholder would otherwise have been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 5.4_, each director of Raven, each officer of Raven who signed the Resale Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls Raven within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Raven. 

   

  

 6. _ _ _Rule 144 Sales_. Raven covenants that, so long as it is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act so as to enable the Participating Stockholder to sell Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 

        

 7. _ _ _Transfer of Registration Rights._ Any Participating Stockholder that is a partnership, corporation or limited liability company may transfer or assign its registration rights provided pursuant to this Rights Agreement with respect to any Resale Securities to any partner, shareholder or member of such Participating Stockholder; _provided that_ (ii) such Participating Stockholder shall give Raven written notice prior to the time of such transfer or assignment stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the Resale Securities with respect to which the rights under this Agreement are being transferred and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing, the form and substance of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Raven, to be bound as a Participating Stockholder by the provisions of this Rights Agreement, following which any such transferee or assignee shall be deemed a "Participating Stockholder" pursuant to this Rights Agreement. 

   

 8. _ _ _Miscellaneous_. 

  

  

 8.1 _ Amendments and Waivers._ The provisions of this Rights Agreements, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived, nor may consent to departures therefrom be given, without the written consent of Raven and the consent of the Participating Stockholders then holding a majority of the Resale Securities. 

  

 8.2 _ Notices_. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery, (i) if to the Participating Stockholders, at the addresses set forth on the signature pages hereto or (ii) if to Raven, at 5655 Spalding Drive, Norcross, Georgia, 30092, Attention: General Counsel. All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; or at the time actually delivered if delivered by an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. 

  

 8.3 _ No Assignment_. This Rights Agreements shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and, where applicable, their successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise permitted herein, no party to this Rights Agreements may assign or delegate all or any portion of its rights, obligations, or liabilities under this Rights Agreements without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Rights Agreements. 

  

 8.4 _ Third Party Beneficiaries_. There shall be no third party beneficiaries or intended beneficiaries of this Rights Agreements. 

  

 8.5 _ Counterparts_. This Rights Agreements may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 8.6 _ Headings_. The headings in this Rights Agreements are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 

  

 8.7 _ Governing Law_. This Rights Agreements shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. 

  

 8.8 _ Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, and accordingly agree that each party, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of any other party under this Rights Agreements in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Rights Agreements in any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction. 

  

      

  
  

 8.9 _ Entire Agreement_. This Rights Agreements is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein.
