2.5. _Effect on Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Purchaser, Merger Sub,
the Company or any Stockholder:

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.5, each share of Common
Stock (other than the Canceled Shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive, upon the surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such
share of Common Stock, an 

 



19  amount equal to the Estimated Per Share Merger Consideration, and each such
share of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Certificate, which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represents any such share of Common Stock, shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (A) the right to receive
the Estimated Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.6,
without interest, and (B) the contingent right to receive that portion of each
Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage attributable to such shares of Common Stock

the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (3) the Stockholder Representative Reserve

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and such share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation issued upon such conversion shall
constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time and shall be
held entirely by the Purchaser.

(c) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by the Company or any Subsidiary
(as treasury or otherwise), or by the Purchaser or any subsidiary of the
Purchaser, including Merger Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ ") shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no payment shall be made in connection with the Merger with
respect thereto.

2.6. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to receiving any portion of the Merger Consideration, each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock (the
" _Certificates_ ") shall have delivered to the Paying Agent (i) a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and the Purchaser (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) the Certificates held of record by such holder. Such
Letter of Transmittal shall have been previously delivered by the Paying
Agent to such holder along with instructions thereto and a notice providing
that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and that risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent,
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5(a), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. If the portion of the Merger Consideration to
be paid with respect to such shares is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is

 



20  registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the exchange to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(a), each Certificate
shall be deemed as of the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Section
2.6(a), the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Common Stock shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5(a). If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance of any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.5(a), require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit or indemnity
agreement with respect to such Certificate. 

(b) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Common Stock represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of the Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws, at any time following the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to the Stockholders, and, thereafter, such
Stockholders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
would otherwise be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such
Stockholders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such Stockholders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
the property of the Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interests of
any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any former Stockholders for any portion of the Merger Consideration or
interest thereon properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(d) The Paying Agent, the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
(as appropriate) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the portion of
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Stockholders such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to

 



21  the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Paying Agent must be
provided with prior written notice by the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation of any such required withholding at least five (5) days
prior to the date of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
(i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Stockholders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made and (ii) the Paying Agent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation (as appropriate) shall provide such Stockholders
written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.

reasonably requested by them to review the information contained in the
Estimated Closing Statement. The Company shall take into consideration
any proposed revisions to the Estimated Closing Statement as are presented in
good faith by the Purchaser. If the Company and the Purchaser are unable to
resolve any dispute with respect to the Estimated Closing Statement, such
dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the Closing, and the amounts
set forth therein shall be calculated as set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement (as modified to reflect any revision mutually agreed upon by the
Purchaser and the Company), for the purposes of the Closing.

(c) The Parties agree that the calculation of the Adjustments contemplated by
the Estimated Closing Statement and the Proposed Final Closing Statement will
be performed in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications and estimation
methodologies (whether with regard to reserves or otherwise) that were used
in the preparation of the Annual Financial Statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 and in the format set forth on Exhibit 1.1(a) and
shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of
purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as
a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

3.3. _Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration_. On the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to (a) the Estimated Merger Consideration
minus (b) the sum of (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) the Stockholder

specifies to the Purchaser in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing Date, the
aggregate amount of the DandO Tail Premium.

 

3.6. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative the draft closing
statement of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed Final Closing
Statement_ "), signed by an authorized officer of the Purchaser (on behalf and
in the name of the Purchaser), which sets forth in reasonable detail and in
accordance with Section 3.2(c): (i) each of the Adjustments as of the Closing
Date, and (ii) based on such Adjustments, a calculation of the Final
Shortfall, if any, the Final Surplus, if any, the Merger Consideration and
the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Proposed Final Closing Statement (the " _Evaluation Period_ ")
during which to notify the Purchaser of any dispute of any Adjustments
contained in the Proposed Final Closing Statement, which notice (the "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such dispute and provide an alternative calculation including reasonable
documentation establishing the basis of such objections and supporting the
calculations of such amount. At any time within the Evaluation Period, the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to agree with any or all of the
Adjustments set forth in the Proposed Final Closing Statement. For purposes of
the 

 



24  Stockholder Representatives evaluation of the Proposed Final Closing
Statement, the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall make available or
provide reasonable access to the Stockholder Representative and his
Representatives, upon advance notice and during normal business hours, all
information, records, data and working papers created or used in connection
with the preparation of the Proposed Final Closing Statement; and shall
permit reasonable access, upon advance notice and during normal business
hours, to the Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries facilities and
personnel, as may be reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
and his Representatives to analyze the Proposed Final Closing Statement.

(c) If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Notice of
Disagreement to the Purchaser within the Evaluation Period, or notifies the
Purchaser of its agreement with the adjustments in the Proposed Final Closing
Statement prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, the
Proposed Final Closing Statement prepared by the Purchaser shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Statement, and shall be final, conclusive and binding on
all Parties.

 

(d) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement to the
Purchaser within the Evaluation Period, the Proposed Final Closing Statement
shall be resolved as follows:

(i) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible.

(ii) In the event the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable
to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall mutually agree in
writing) after delivery to the Purchaser of the Notice of Disagreement, such
dispute and each Partys work papers related thereto shall be submitted to
Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Arbitrator_ ") for resolution in accordance with
this Section 3.6(d)(ii). The Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to the Arbitrator within thirty (30)
days of the making of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Arbitrator shall be limited to whether the items in dispute
that were included in the Notice of Disagreement were prepared in accordance
with this Agreement and the Arbitrator shall determine, on such basis,
whether and to what extent, the Proposed Final Closing Statement requires
adjustment. The Arbitrator is not to make any other determinations. The
Arbitrators decision shall be based solely on written submissions and
presentations by the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser and their
respective Representatives and not by independent review, and shall be made in
accordance with GAAP, consistent with the accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications and estimation
methodologies (whether with regard to reserves or otherwise) that were used in
the preparation of the Annual Financial Statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 and in the format set forth in Exhibit 1.1(a), to
the extent applicable. To the extent there is any inconsistency between GAAP
and the

 



25  principles used in the Annual Financial Statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016, GAAP (in the manner used in connection with the
preparation of the Annual Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016) will prevail. The Arbitrator shall address only those items
in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either the Purchaser or the Stockholder Representative, or
smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either such Party.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Arbitrator in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be allocated
between the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), on the
one hand, and the Purchaser (or, at its election, the Surviving Corporation),
on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such Party (as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the
total amount of such disputed items so submitted. For example, if the
Stockholder Representative challenges the calculation of the Proposed Final
Closing Statement by an amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), but
the Arbitrator determines that the Stockholder Representative has a valid
claim for only Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000), the Purchaser (or, at its
election, the Surviving Corporation) shall bear forty percent (40%) of the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and the Stockholders shall bear the other
sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses, with the Stockholders portion
of such fees and expenses paid solely out of the Stockholder Representative
Reserve.

 

(e) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative jointly shall revise the
Proposed Final Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Cash, the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the 2017 Capital Expenditures, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Company Payment
Amount, along with the resulting Merger Consideration, Final Shortfall, if
any, and Final Surplus, if any, as appropriate to reflect the resolution of
the Stockholder Representatives objections (as agreed upon by the Purchaser
and the Stockholder Representative or as determined by the Arbitrator) within
ten (10) days after the resolution of such objections. Such revised Proposed
Final Closing Statement shall be the Final Closing Statement, and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all Parties.

 

(f) To the extent there is a Final Shortfall on the Final Closing Statement,
the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover the amount of the Final Shortfall
solely from the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

(g) To the extent there is a Final Surplus on the Final Closing Statement,
the Purchaser shall pay the Paying Agent, on behalf of the Stockholders, the
amount of the Final Surplus by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days after the completed revision of the Final
Closing Statement to an account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent.
Upon such payment, Paying Agent shall disburse promptly such amount to the
Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages.

 



26 (h) If there is no Final Shortfall and no Final Surplus, then no
further adjustments or payments shall be made.

(i) The Escrow Agreement shall provide that on the date upon which a payment
of the Final Surplus or Final Shortfall, as the case may be, is to be made
pursuant to this Section 3.6, the Escrow Agent shall, upon receipt of joint
written instructions of the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, make
the following payments:

(A) if there is a Final Surplus (or not a Final Shortfall), the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Stockholders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages, the entire Adjustment Escrow Fund;
or

(B) if there is a Final Shortfall, the Escrow Agent shall pay (i) to the
Purchaser, the lesser of the amount of such Final Shortfall or the amount of
the Adjustment Escrow Fund and (ii) to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages, the amount,
if any, by which the Adjustment Escrow Fund exceeds the Final Shortfall.

3.7.  _Withholding_. Each of the Purchaser, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement, including from the Closing Date Company Payment
Amount, such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold
pursuant to applicable Tax Laws. The Purchaser, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall timely deposit any such withheld amounts with the proper
Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so withheld paid over to
the proper Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

required to be listed in Section 4.14(e) of the Disclosure Schedule. The
Company has made available to the Purchaser, with respect to all such Company
Benefit Plans true, complete and correct copies of the following, to the
extent applicable: all plan and trust documents and any amendment thereto (or
for any such Company Benefit Plan that is not in writing, a written
description of the material terms thereof); the most recent summary plan
descriptions and any subsequent summaries of material modifications; all
reports and returns filed with any regulatory agency or other Governmental
Entity including but not limited to financial statements and Forms 5500 series
as filed with the IRS for the three (3) most recent plan years for any
Company Benefit Plan to which such reporting requirements apply; and the most
recent IRS determination letter.

 

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan required to be listed on Section
4.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule: (i) each such Company Benefit Plan has
been administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and is
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws (including reporting and
disclosure obligations and health care continuation coverage obligations
pursuant to COBRA), (ii) all contributions or premiums required to be made or
paid by the Company and its Affiliates to the Company Benefit Plans have been
made or paid in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of the Company
Benefit Plans and any applicable Law or Contract, and all employee
contributions to the Company Benefit Plans required to be made by way of
authorized payroll deduction have been properly withheld by the Company and
its Affiliates and fully paid into the Company Benefit Plans when due, and
(iii) there are no material proceedings, claims or suits pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Entity or by any
participant or beneficiary (other than routine claims for benefits) against
any of the Company Benefit Plans.

 



39 (c) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section
401(a), Section 401(k), Section 401(m) or Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code has
either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status or (ii) may rely upon a favorable prototype opinion letter
from the IRS, and to the Companys Knowledge, no fact or event has occurred
that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, except for such facts or events
that can be remedied without material liability to the Company.

(d) Except as required by applicable Law or as set forth in Section 4.14(d)
of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides any retiree
medical, dental or life insurance benefits to any Person. No Company Benefit
Plan is a voluntary employee benefit association under Section 501(a)(9) of
the Code or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063,
4064 or 4066 of ERISA. Except for the Multiemployer Plans required to be
listed in Section 4.14(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
including any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), or
other Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(e) Section 4.14(e) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of each Multiemployer Plan to which the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is (or, within the past six years, was previously) required to make
contributions or has any express or contingent liability (each a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). The Company and each of its ERISA Affiliates have
timely made all contributions required to be made by it to each Multiemployer
Plan under the terms of the Multiemployer Plan and/or the applicable
collective bargaining agreement that governs such contribution obligation.
Except as otherwise set forth on Section 4.14(e) of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, (a) have incurred or
triggered either a complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in section 4203
or 4205 of ERISA) from any Multiemployer Plan or (b) have any Knowledge as of
the date hereof of any facts that would give rise to a partial withdrawal from
any such plan by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates. For each
Multiemployer Plan, the Company has made available to Purchaser (a) true and
correct copies of all material correspondence provided to it from each such
Multiemployer Plan relating to its funded status, or relating to or
describing the existence of any minimum funding violation or application for
waiver of a minimum funding violation, (b) copies of any participation
agreements entered into between the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
and the Multiemployer Plan, (c) for any Multiemployer Plan for which the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has been assessed any withdrawal
liability, copies of (i) the notice and assessment, (ii) the payment schedule,
and (iii) if applicable, the request for review and final determination, and
(d) a copy of a letter from the administrator of the Multiemployer Plan
setting forth the estimated withdrawal liability that would be imposed by the
Multiemployer Plan if the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable,
were to withdraw from the Multiemployer Plan in a

 



40  complete withdrawal, in the plan year specified in the most recently
obtained estimate, _if any_ , and the factors and methods used to determine
such estimate. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material
change in the financial condition of any Multiemployer Plan, in any actuarial
assumption or computation method or in the benefits under any Multiemployer
Plan since the end of the period upon which such estimate was based which,
individually or in the aggregate, would materially increase such liability.

(f) Section 4.14(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth information from
the actuarial reports in the Companys possession regarding the status of any
unfunded liability under any Company Benefit Plan that is a pension plan, as
defined under applicable Law. No changes have occurred since the date of the
most recent actuarial report provided to the Purchaser in respect of such
pension plan(s) which makes such report misleading in any material respect
and, since the date of such report, the Company and its Affiliates have not
made or granted or committed to make or grant any benefit improvements to
which members of the pension plan(s) are or may become entitled which are not
reflected in such actuarial report. The booklets, brochures,
summaries, descriptions and manuals prepared for, and circulated to, the
employees of the Company and its Affiliates concerning each Company Benefit
Plan that is a pension plan, together with all written communications of a
general nature provided to such employees, accurately describe the benefits
provided under each such Company Benefit Plan. No event has occurred
respecting any registered Company Benefit Plan that would entitle any Person
or Government Entity (without the consent of the Company) to cause the wind-
up or termination of such Company Benefit Plan in whole or in part.

 

(g) All benefits, contributions and premiums required by and due under the
terms of each Company Benefit Plan or applicable Laws have been timely paid
in accordance with the terms of such Company Benefit Plan, the terms of all
applicable Laws and GAAP.

 

(h) Except as set forth in Section 4.14(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has no obligation to reimburse or otherwise "gross-up" any Person for
any Taxes or any interest or penalty related thereto in connection with any
Company Benefit Plan.

association or similar entity, nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, nor has there been for the past three years, any
labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not entitle any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any third party (including any labor union or labor
organization) to any payments under any of the Collective Bargaining
Agreements.

 

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment
practices (including equal employment opportunity and pay equity Laws), human
rights, accessibility, terms and conditions of employment, workers
compensation, occupational safety and health, immigration and wages and
hours.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in any
payments to any of their respective employees, former employees, contractors
or former contractors, or other Persons who have performed services for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or are otherwise entitled to receive
remuneration for work or services provided to the Company for any wages,
salaries, commissions, bonuses or other compensation for any services
performed for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All such individuals
are, and have been, correctly classified as exempt or nonexempt for purposes
of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other similar law, and no individual
who has performed services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been
improperly excluded from participation in any Employee Benefit Plan.

or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and
the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar foreign, state or local
Law that remains unsatisfied.

be provided to Purchaser at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the
Closing) sets forth (i) a true and complete list of all of the employees of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof; (ii) the base
compensation (salary or wage rate) and target bonus of each such employee;
(iii) the title, position and/or job classification, date of hire, credited
service or seniority, full-time versus part-time status, active or leave
status, and location of each such employee; and (iv) in relation to
employees, a statement of whether each position or job classification is
exempt or nonexempt for purposes of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

 

(h) Each individual that renders services to the Company who is classified by
the Company as having the status of an independent contractor or other
nonemployee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax
reporting and under the Company Benefit Plans) is properly so classified.

 



42 4.16. _Insurance Policies_. Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete list of all material insurance policies carried as of the date
hereof by or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
specifying the insurer, the amount of and nature of coverage, the risk insured

_Insurance Policies_ "). All insurance policies with respect to the business
and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect
except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Insurance Policies provide

premiums that are due. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all premiums and
other amounts payable to date by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under the Insurance Policies have been paid and the Company and
its Subsidiaries have complied with the other terms and provisions of the
Insurance Policies. The insurance coverage provided by the Insurance Policies

list of all (i) Company Registered Intellectual Property, (ii) material
unregistered Intellectual Property (including trademarks and service marks)

46  or Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Purchaser Ancillary Documents, and

the creation of a Lien on any material property or material asset of the
Purchaser or Merger Sub, in all cases, pursuant to any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any (A) Contract applicable to the Purchaser or
Merger Sub or (B) judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity, to
which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is a party or, to the Knowledge of the
Purchaser, by which the Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective
material properties or assets are bound, except, with respect to clauses (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences that would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

47 5.4. _Capitalization of Merger Sub; Common Stock Ownership_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub has been at all times (at the
Effective Time, will be) owned by the Purchaser. Merger Sub has not conducted
any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) None of Purchaser or Merger Sub or their respective controlled affiliates

Merger Sub or their respective controlled affiliates holds any rights to
acquire or vote any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.

5.5. _Financial Capacity_. The Purchaser will have, at the Closing on
the Closing Date, sufficient funds available to pay all amounts to be paid by
the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any Debt
Financing by the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof be a condition to any of
the Purchasers obligations hereunder.

5.6. _Legal Proceedings_. There is no suit, action, claim, arbitration or
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser, any of its subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) or any property of any of such Persons which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.7. _Financing_. The Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true, accurate
and complete copy of a fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto) from
the Debt Financing Sources named therein to the Purchaser (collectively, the "
_Debt Financing Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to the terms, but subject to
the conditions, of which the Debt Financing Sources parties thereto have
committed to provide the Purchaser and Merger Sub with debt financing (the "
_Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Financing Commitment Letter has not been
amended, modified or waived in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement
and, as of the date of this Agreement, no such amendment, modification or
waiver is pending or contemplated (other than amendments or joinders to be
entered into to add additional Debt Financing Sources). Neither the Purchaser
nor any of its subsidiaries has entered into any side letter or other
agreement relating to the funding of the Debt Financing, other than as set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the fee letters related
thereto, and there are no arrangements related to the Debt Financing that
would be reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the
Debt Financing. The proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after
giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions related
thereto), together with cash on hand and any long-term debt financing that
replaces all or a portion of the Debt Financing (each such debt financing,
a " _Replacement Financing_ ", and collectively, the " _Replacement
Financings_ "), will be sufficient for the payment of the Merger Consideration
when due on the Closing. As of the date of this 

 



48  Agreement, the commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each other party thereto, to
provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Conditions_ ") except as limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
in effect which affect the enforcement of creditors rights generally. The
Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of the Purchaser,
or, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, any other party thereto, under the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter. Regardless of whether the Debt Financing is
obtained, the Purchaser represents and acknowledges that, under the terms of
this Agreement, Purchasers obligation to complete the Merger is not in any
way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the Purchasers consummation of
any financing arrangements, Purchasers obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Purchaser.

5.8. _Reliance; Inspection_. The Purchaser has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In making its decision to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the Purchaser and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that it has
(a) relied solely upon the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article IV and acknowledges that (i) such representations and
warranties are the only representations and warranties made by the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (ii) no representations or warranties whatsoever, express
or implied, are made by the Stockholders, their Representatives or any Person
other than the Company and (b) not relied upon any other information provided
by, for or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
respective Representatives, to the Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of

premises, appropriate employees (including executive officers), properties,
Contracts, commitments, books, records and other information (including
personnel records as permitted by applicable Law, Tax Returns filed and Tax
Returns in

 



53  preparation) and will furnish to the Purchaser and its Representatives any
and all available financial and operating data and other information
pertaining to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as the
Purchaser and its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives shall not
be required to provide any information that (i) it reasonably believes, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, it may not provide to the Purchaser
by reason of contractual obligations of confidentiality or applicable Laws,
(ii) would give rise to a material risk of the disclosure of competitively
sensitive information or (iii) it reasonably believes, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, would risk in any material respect waiving attorney-
client privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) in such instances the
Company shall inform the Purchaser of the general nature of the information
being withheld and, upon the Purchasers request, reasonably cooperate with
the Purchaser to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a
manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) (including, in accordance with the last
sentence of this Section 6.2(a)) and (B) no investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.2 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company herein; _provided_ , _further_ , that such investigation
shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable Antitrust Laws and shall

designate any competitively sensitive information provided to the Purchaser
under this Agreement as being for "outside counsel only" and such information
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the Purchaser and may not be
shared with the Purchaser or its Representatives (other than such outside
counsel).

 

(b) All information provided or obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be held by the Purchaser in accordance with the
letter agreement relating to confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations
dated July 11, 2017 between the Purchaser and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the terms hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms hereof
will govern.

6.3. _Government Filings and Approvals_.

(a) Each Party promptly shall, and in the case of any premerger notifications
and related documentation required under the HSR Act, the Competition Act and
the Canada Transportation Act, no later than ten (10) Business Days following
the date hereof, make all filings and submissions and shall take all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, with the
exception of a Triggering Divestiture, to obtain any required approval of any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Party shall furnish to the appropriate Governmental Entity all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the Parties shall cooperate with the other in promptly filing any
other necessary applications, reports or other documents with any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and in seeking necessary consultation with
and prompt favorable action by such Governmental Entity.

 



54 (b) Each Party shall promptly notify the other of any written notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall include Representatives of the Company and the Purchaser. No Party may
extend, or take any action that would have the effect of extending, the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Competition Act or the
Canada Transportation Act without the prior written consent of each of the
other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without limitation thereof,
Purchaser shall, in all cases in good faith consultation with the Company,
(1) determine timing and strategy and be solely responsible for the final
content of any substantive oral or written communications with any applicable
Governmental Entity, and (2) lead all proceedings and coordinate
all activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers of any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act, the Competition Act and
the Canada Transportation Act; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser
shall in good faith consider all views and input provided by the Company.

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Entity or other Person
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any Governmental
Entity challenges any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any applicable Antitrust Law or the Canada Transportation Act or an order
is issued enjoining the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable
Antitrust Law or the Canada Transportation Act, the Purchaser shall, subject
to the provisions of this Section 6.3, use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or challenges as such Governmental Entity or
other Person may have to such transactions under such Law or to have the order
vacated, reversed or otherwise removed in accordance with applicable legal
procedures with the goal of enabling the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated by the End Date, and the Company shall assist the
Purchaser in effectuating the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the consent of
the Company if such actions would bind the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to take any action (including paying money or entering into any other
obligation) irrespective of whether the Closing occurs. The Purchaser shall,
subject to the provisions of this Section 6.3, use its reasonable best efforts
to seek to lift, reverse or remove any temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or decree that would
otherwise give rise to a failure of any condition to the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without in any way limiting its
rights or obligations hereunder, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it
is the intent of the Purchaser to cause the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
shall, to the extent necessary in order to obtain approval of any Governmental
Entity or otherwise permit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated on a timely basis, (i) cause any asset or business, or any
portion of any asset or business, of the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or,
following the Closing, of the Company or any Subsidiary to be sold, divested
or otherwise disposed of; (ii) enter into or cause any of its Affiliates or,
concurrent with the Closing, the Company or any Subsidiary to enter into a

 



55  voting trust agreement, proxy arrangement or other similar agreement or
arrangement with respect to any asset or business or any portion of any asset
or business; and (iii) agree to amendments to this Agreement as may be
requested by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of
Justice pursuant to the HSR Act, the Competition Commissioner under the
Competition Act, the Governor-in-Council under the Canada Transportation Act
or otherwise in order to facilitate clearance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Competition Act and the
Canada Transportation Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall require the Purchaser to take, or cause to be taken, or
commit to take, or commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture, sale or other
disposition that would constitute a Triggering Divestiture. In no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to take, or commit to take,
any of the actions required to be taken by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 6.3(d).

 

(e) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire
or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation, would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay
in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering any judgment decree or order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove
any such judgment decree or order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.4. _Public Announcements_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, each Party shall consult with the other Parties with respect to the
timing and content of all announcements regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to the financial community, customers or the
general public and shall use its reasonable best efforts to agree upon the
text of any such announcement prior to its release; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the parties from making any
public disclosure that Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, deems
necessary or appropriate under applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market,
in which case such Party required to make the release or announcement shall
allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.5. _Company Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) With respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
dependents and beneficiaries where appropriate), (i) the Purchaser shall, at
least through December 31, 2018, provide compensation and benefits on terms
that are substantially

 



56  comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Closing; (ii)
the Purchaser shall assume and continue to maintain the Change of Control
Severance Plans and shall not amend such plans (other than to increase
benefits) within the 12 month period following Closing; and (iii) the
Purchaser shall as of the Closing (A) recognize such employees employment
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (including credit for service
with predecessor employers as currently recognized under the applicable
Company Benefit Plans) for participation, vesting and benefit
eligibility purposes under any Employee Benefit Plan that the Purchaser may
provide to such employees, (B) not require such employees, in the plan year in
which the Closing occurs, to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out of
pocket maximum or similar requirement under any Employee Benefit Plan that the
Purchaser may provide to such employees to the extent of amounts previously
credited for such purposes under the applicable plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (C) not apply to such employees any waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good health
contained in any Employee Benefit Plan that the Purchaser may provide to such
employees to the extent waiting periods, pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and requirements were satisfied under the corresponding Company Benefit Plans
and (D) honor in full all accrued but unused vacation accrued in accordance
with Company policy and recognize pre-Closing and post-Closing service with
the Company or its Subsidiaries (including credit for service with
predecessor employers as currently recognized under the applicable Companys
Employee Benefit Plans) for purposes of accrual of vacation following the
Closing Date.

 

(b) The Company shall remain solely responsible for the satisfaction of all
claims for medical, dental, life insurance, health accident or disability
benefits brought by or in respect of current or former employees, officers,
directors, independent contractors or consultants or the spouses, dependents
or beneficiaries thereof, which claims relate to events occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date under the Company Benefit Plans. The Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, all such amounts to the appropriate persons as and when due.

 

(c) All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee
benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of
the respective Parties and shall not create any right in any other Person,
including any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any participant or beneficiary in any Company Benefit Plan.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan.

6.6.  _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to
continue to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing
Date were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or 

 



57  investigation with respect to any acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser
agrees that all rights of such Persons to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights of such indemnitees unless such
modification is required by applicable Law. In addition, the Purchaser shall
cause the Company to pay any expenses of any such indemnitee under this
Section 6.6 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable
Law.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that (i) the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liability that are at least as favorable
to the beneficiaries of such provisions as those provisions that are set forth
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, respectively, on the date of
this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Persons who at or
prior to the Closing were directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification is required by
applicable Law, and (ii) all rights to indemnification as provided in any
indemnification agreements with any current or former directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the
date hereof with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing.

 

(c) The Parties agree that the Purchaser (or a third party at the direction of
the Purchaser), at the Purchasers sole expense, will pay at the Closing an
amount sufficient to enable the Company to purchase "tail" coverage for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date under the directors and
officers liability insurance policy of the Company, as in effect on the
Closing Date. The aggregate amount necessary to purchase such "tail" coverage
shall be referred to as the " _D andO Tail Premium_." In satisfying its
obligation under this Section 6.6(c), the Purchaser shall not be obligated to
pay aggregate premiums in excess of Two Hundred Percent (200%) of the amount
paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year, it being understood and
agreed that the Purchaser shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such Two Hundred Percent (200%) amount.

(d) In the event the Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or 

 



58  merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (as
applicable) assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6(b).

 

(e) This Section 6.6, which shall survive the Closing and shall continue for
the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit any Person or entity
referenced in this Section 6.6 or indemnified hereunder, each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.6 (whether or not parties to this
Agreement). The obligations of the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies without
the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the indemnities to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6).

 

6.7. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Stockholder Representative shall, at Stockholders expense, prepare or
cause to be prepared and file with the appropriate Governmental Entity or
cause to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity all Pass-Through
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, including but not limited to the Companys
final IRS Form 1120S Tax Return (the " _Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax
Returns_"). All such Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Returns shall be prepared
substantially in accordance with past practice, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Returns,
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax
Returns to the Purchaser for its review, comment, and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Purchaser shall provide its comments, in writing, on such Pre-Closing Pass-
Through Tax Returns to the Stockholder Representative no later than fifteen
(15) days after the Purchasers receipt of the draft of such Pre-Closing Pass-
Through Tax Returns. The Stockholder Representative shall make such changes to
the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Purchaser in such written request and that are in accordance with applicable
Law.

 

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file with the
appropriate Governmental Entity or cause to be filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entity all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries other
than the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Returns. All Tax Returns (other than
the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Returns) of the Company and the Subsidiaries
for Tax periods which end on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing
 Returns_") or for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Returns_ ") shall be prepared in good
faith and in accordance with

 



59  past practice, except to the extent inconsistent with applicable Law. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make the elections referred to in
subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act and the comparable provisions of any
applicable Law of any province or territory of Canada, and to file such
elections in respect of the Corporations or Subsidiarys, as the case may
be, taxation year ending immediately before the Closing under the Tax Act. No
later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for
filing any Pre-Closing Returns or Straddle Returns, the Purchaser shall
deliver the Pre-Closing Returns and the Straddle Returns to the Stockholder
Representative for review, comment and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Stockholder Representative
shall provide its comments, in writing, on such Pre-Closing Returns or
Straddle Returns to the Purchaser no later than fifteen (15) days after the
Stockholder Representatives receipt of the drafts of such Tax Returns. The
Purchaser shall make such changes to the Pre-Closing Returns and the Straddle
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative in such
written request and that are in accordance with applicable Law. With respect
to any Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return, the Stockholder Representative
shall remit (on behalf of the Stockholders) to the Purchaser at least five
(5) days prior to the due date for filing such Pre-Closing Return or Straddle
Return all Pre-Closing Taxes payable with respect to any Pre-Closing Return
or Straddle Return, except to the extent such Taxes have been included or
reflected as a negative adjustment in Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 

(iii) All Tax deductions for Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date Company
Payment Amount, Taxes incurred in connection with the Closing Date Company
Payment Amount, and interest, prepayment or other penalties, expenses or other
amounts paid with respect to Closing Date Indebtedness, shall be allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(iv) The Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any disputes regarding the Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax
Returns, the Pre-Closing Returns and the Straddle Returns prior to the due
date (including extensions) of such Tax Returns. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any such
dispute by the date five (5) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return,
they shall submit such dispute to the Arbitrator, and the resolution of such
dispute by the Arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If
the Arbitrator is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for
filing the applicable Tax Return (after giving effect to validly obtained
extensions of time to make such filings) (a " _Contested Tax Return_ "), the
Tax Return as prepared by the party initially charged with the preparation of
such Tax Return pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(i) or Section 6.7(a)(ii) above
shall be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Entity. Upon the resolution by the Arbitrator of the disputed items, such
Contested Tax Return shall be amended, to the extent required in the judgment
of the Arbitrator, to reflect the Arbitrators resolution of

 



60  such items, and such Tax Return, as revised to reflect such resolution ("
_Resolved Tax Return_ "), shall be executed and duly and timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Entity. Corrective adjustments shall be made to the
payments made by or on behalf of the Stockholders pursuant to Section
6.7(a)(i) or Section 6.7(a)(ii) to reflect the changes made to the Contested
Tax Return through the Resolved Tax Return in accordance with the Tax payment
and reimbursement principles set forth in Section 6.7(a)(i) and Section
6.7(a)(ii).

 

(b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period (i) the amount of
any property and similar ad valorem taxes that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such property and similar ad
valorem taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, the amount of such Taxes (including those based on or measured by
income or receipts, sales or use Taxes, employment Taxes, or withholding Taxes
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) that relate to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, the Company and the
Stockholder Representative shall provide such cooperation and information, as
and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the signing and
filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determination of liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or in
conducting any audit, administrative or judicial proceeding, litigation or
demand, claim or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (" _Tax Proceeding_
"). Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying schedules and
relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings and
other determinations by taxing authorities, and relevant records concerning
the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such Party may possess.
Each Party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers, and all
material records and other documents relating to Tax matters of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods until 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notice
is provided with respect thereto, any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods
to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate, and will abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority. Each Party
shall make its employees or representatives reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents
or information so provided. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no officer, director, or employee of Purchaser (or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Closing or any of their Affiliates) shall be
required to execute any penalties-of-perjury statement required to be
prepared in connection with a Tax Proceeding or Tax Return if such individual
is advised in writing by Purchasers legal counsel that that there is a more
than immaterial risk that the execution of such statement by such individual
will subject such individual to criminal or civil claim liability (after
giving effect to any available exceptions or abatements with respect to any
civil penalties).

 



61 (d) _Amending Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise required by an
applicable Governmental Entity, neither the Purchaser nor the Company, nor
any of their Affiliates, shall, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) amend or otherwise revise any Pre-Closing Pass-
Through Tax Returns, Pre-Closing Returns or Straddle Returns of the Company or
any Subsidiary.

 

(e) _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(i) Within a reasonable time (but not more than ten (10) days) after the
Purchaser or the Company receives written notice of any Tax Proceeding
relating to a Pre-Closing Pass-Through Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and that
involves solely Pass-Through Taxes of the Stockholders (a " _Stockholder
Pass-Through Tax Proceeding_ "), the Purchaser shall notify or cause the
Company to notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of such
Stockholder Pass-Through Tax Proceeding.

 

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right (but not the
obligation), at its own expense, to control the defense of any Stockholder
Pass-Through Tax Proceeding, including any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding that is
in process or pending at the Effective Time. Stockholder Representative shall
notify Purchaser and the Company whether Stockholder Representative intends
to control the defense of such Stockholder Pass-Through Tax Proceeding, which
notice shall be given no later than twenty (20) days following Stockholder
Representatives receipt of notice of a Stockholder Pass-Through Tax
Proceeding, and no later than thirty (30) days following the date of Closing
in the case of a Stockholder Pass-Through Tax Proceeding that is in process or
pending at the Effective Time. The Purchaser shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense, in any Stockholder Pass-Through Tax
Proceeding controlled by Stockholder Representative. The Purchaser shall
notify the Stockholder Representative of the Purchasers intention to
participate in such Stockholder Pass-Through Tax Proceeding no later than
twenty (20) days following the Purchasers or the Companys receipt of notice
of the Stockholder Pass-Through Tax Proceeding. The Stockholder Representative
shall not settle, compromise, or concede such Stockholder Pass-Through Tax
Proceeding without the Purchasers prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

 

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, shall be entitled to receive from the Purchaser or the Company
or their Affiliate all refunds (or credits for overpayments) of Pre-Closing
Taxes of the Company (including any interest and penalties thereon) to the
extent such refund (or credit for overpayment) of Pre-Closing Taxes and
interest and penalties thereon is not included or reflected as a positive
adjustment in the Closing Date Net Working Capital and after full offset for
any outstanding Pre-Closing Taxes as measured on a cumulative basis that are
in excess of the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes paid by or on behalf of the
Stockholders 

 



62  pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(i) and Section 6.7(a)(ii). Upon receipt of any
refund (or credit for overpayment) of Pre-Closing Taxes (including
any interest and penalties thereon) by the Purchaser, the Company or any of
their Affiliates, the Purchaser will, and will cause the Company or any
Affiliate to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount of such refund of Pre-Closing Taxes (or credit for
overpayment) plus interest and penalties thereon to the Stockholder
Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders (as reflective of the
offset for any outstanding Pre-Closing Taxes described in the preceding
sentence). Such payment shall be made to the Stockholder Representative no
later than fifteen (15) days following the actual receipt by the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Affiliates of such refund or, in the case of a Tax
credit, no later than fifteen (15) days after such credit is applied to
actually reduce other Taxes of the Purchaser, the Company or their Affiliates
then currently due.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use, real estate transfer, stock transfer or
similar transfer Tax (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 

(h) _Characterization of Certain Payments_. For all relevant Tax purposes, the
Parties agree to treat the Adjustment Escrow Fund as an asset of the
Purchaser and all interest and other earnings on the Adjustment Escrow Fund as
earnings of the Purchaser (it being understood that this Tax characterization
shall not affect which Person is entitled to such earnings). Unless otherwise
required by a determination of a Governmental Entity that is final, no Party
shall file a Tax Return, or take position during the course of any audit or
other proceeding, that is inconsistent with such agreement.

 

6.8. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(a) All of the Stockholders shall join with the Purchaser in making joint
elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any comparable election
under state or local Laws (collectively, the " _338(h)(10) Election_ ") with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Stockholders
and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each other in the making of the
338(h)(10) Election, including the filing of all required IRS forms and
related forms under state and local Law. No later than three (3) days prior to
the date of Closing, each Stockholder shall deliver to the Purchaser a fully
executed Form 8023 (and any comparable forms required to be filed under state,
local, or foreign tax Law) (the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election
Forms_"). The Stockholders and Purchaser agree that the Merger Consideration
shall be allocated among the assets of the Company for all purposes in a
manner consistent with the allocation methodology set forth in Annex B to this
Agreement (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ").

 

(b) The Purchaser will initially prepare IRS Form 8883 (and any comparable
forms required to be filed under state, local or foreign Law) and any
additional data or materials required to be attached to the Section 338(h)(10)
Election Forms or Form 8883 pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 338 of the Code (the " _Section_ __ _ 338 Forms_"). The
Purchaser shall prepare the Section 338 Forms in a manner which is consistent
in all respects with the Purchase Price Allocation methodology set forth in
Annex B. The Purchaser will deliver the Section 338 Forms to the Stockholder

 



63  Representative for review no later than 60 days prior to the date such forms
are required to be filed. In the event the Stockholder Representative
reasonably objects to the manner in which the Section 338 Forms have been
prepared, the Stockholder Representative will notify the Purchaser within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Section 338 Forms of such objection, and
the parties will endeavor within the following fifteen (15) days to resolve
such dispute in good faith. The failure of the Stockholder Representative to
timely notify the Purchaser within this fifteen (15)-day period shall render
the Section 338 Forms final and binding upon both parties. If the Stockholder
Representative timely objects and the parties are unable to resolve such
dispute within this fifteen-day period, the Purchaser,
Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders will submit such dispute to
the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall determine (based solely on
representations of the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative and not by
independent review but in a manner consistent in all respects with the
Purchase Price Allocation methodology set forth in Annex B) only those matters
in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters and the
resulting preparation of the Section 338 Forms will be conclusive and binding
upon the parties. The Company, the Purchaser and the Stockholders shall file
their respective Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation and with the 338 Forms, and no Party shall
take any position (whether in Tax Proceedings, Tax Returns or otherwise) that
is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation and the 338 Forms, unless
required to do so hereunder or by an applicable Governmental Entity.

 

6.9. _Notification of Events; Supplemental Disclosure_.

 

(a) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Company in writing if the Purchaser becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact or condition that
would cause or constitute a breach of any of its or Merger Subs
representations or warranties had any such representation or warranty been
made as of the time of the Purchasers discovery of such event, fact or
condition and (ii) any material failure on its or Merger Subs part to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it or Merger Sub hereunder.

 

(b) During the period prior to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser in writing if
the Company becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
or the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute a
breach of any of the Companys representations or warranties contained herein
had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of the discovery
of such event, fact or condition and (ii) any material failure on the part of
the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

6.10. _Retention of Books and Records_. The Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to retain all books, ledgers,
files, reports, plans, operating records and any other material documents
pertaining to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in existence at
the Closing that are required to be retained under current retention

 



64  policies for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, and to make
the same available after the Closing for inspection and copying by the
Stockholder Representative or its Representatives at the Stockholder
Representatives expense, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable advance notice.

 

6.11. _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact or
communicate with the employees, customers or suppliers of the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries, or any other Persons having a business relationship
with the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby or any of the relationships between the Company and such
Persons without the prior written consent of the Company.

 

6.12. _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to the right of the Purchaser to consummate a Replacement
Financing or another financing contemplated by Section 6.12(c), the Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper
to obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and
any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and comply with its obligations
thereunder; (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Purchaser, seek a waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing
(including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case,
within the control of Purchaser and required to be satisfied by it; (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive debt financing agreements on a timely
basis on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions)
(the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "); and (iv) if the Debt
Financing is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 and the
Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied,
enforce all of its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and cause the Debt Financing Source to
fund the full amount of the Debt Financing. The Purchaser shall give the
Company prompt written notice (A) of, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in breach or
default) by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, (B) if and
when, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter may not be available on
the Closing Date for the purposes of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (C) of any expiration or termination of
the Debt Financing other than an expiration or termination in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. Upon the reasonable
request of the Company, the Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis with reasonably detailed information about the status
of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter and the Replacement

 



65  Financings, if any, and provide to the Company copies of all material
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (provided, however, any fee
letter may be customarily redacted in respect of (x) fee amounts and pricing
and (y) terms of any market flex in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Debt Financing Source). If the Debt Financing is necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, then neither the Purchaser nor any of its
subsidiaries shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Debt Financing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit Merger
Sub to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment or other modification
of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements if such termination, amendment or modification (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of proceeds of the Debt Financing (including by way of
increased OID or fees) necessary to pay the Merger Consideration or (ii)
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise modifies any of the
Financing Conditions or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing or (y) make the
timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the Financing
Conditions materially less likely to occur, other than, in each case, (A) a
waiver of any closing conditions by lenders or their agent or (B) to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof or to reassign titles to such parties who had executed the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser shall have the right to substitute other financing for all or
any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative Debt
Financing Source as set forth (and subject to the requirements) below, without
the Companys prior written consent. Upon any such amendment, modification or
substitution (including with any Replacement Financing), the term " _Debt
Financing Commitment Letter_ " and " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "
shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing
Agreement, as applicable, as so amended, modified or replaced and shall
include the related commitment letters, engagement letters, term sheets and
other definitive agreements with respect to each Replacement Financing and the
term " _Debt Financing_ " shall be deemed to include such Replacement
Financing. The Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
such material amendment or other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
shall have the right to enter into a Replacement Financing and/or substitute
the proceeds of consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or other
incurrences of debt for all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and may reduce commitments under the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) to the extent any such equity or debt has a scheduled
special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior
to the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement and the End Date and (ii) the conditions to the
use of such proceeds to pay the Merger Consideration when due shall be no more
restrictive, taken as a whole, than the Financing Conditions.

 



66 (d) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the
Merger Consideration becomes unavailable, then Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reasons therefor and use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable,
from the same and/or alternative Debt Financing Source, alternative financing
in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration when due containing
conditions to closing and funding that (A) are not more onerous, taken as a
whole, than the Financing Conditions and (B) would not reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent the Closing and (ii) obtain, and when obtained, promptly
deliver to the Company copies of the new financing commitment letter that
provides for such alternative financing. In the event any alternative
financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 6.12(d) (" _Alternative
Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall also
be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more
commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or
proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing,
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such
commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 6.12 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as
Purchasers obligations with respect to the Debt Financing.

 

(e) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 6.12 and the Debt
Financing Sources or other prospective lenders being subject to obligations
of confidentiality on customary terms, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to provide, to the Purchaser and its
Affiliates all cooperation that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser
(including reasonable requests of banks, initial purchasers, underwriters or
other Debt Financing Sources or their counsel) to assist the Purchaser and
its Affiliates in the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing
(including (i) providing the Required Information, (ii) assisting with
preparation and execution of any definitive guarantee and collateral
documents (including schedules thereto) reasonably necessary to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
provision of collateral to the extent required by the terms of the Debt
Financing, (iii) cooperating reasonably with the Debt Financing Sources due
diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable, in connection with the Debt
Financing, (iv) participating (and causing senior management to participate)
in due diligence sessions, (v) causing the Companys auditors to deliver
customary consents and comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort) with respect to financial information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by the Purchaser as necessary or
customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing and to attend
accounting due diligence sessions and (vi) at least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other information
about the Company that is reasonably requested by the Debt Financing Sources
and is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent requested
by the Purchaser in writing at least seven (7) business days prior to the
Closing Date.

 



67 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to provide,
or to cause its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to
provide, cooperation under this Section 6.12 that unreasonably interferes with
the ongoing business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this Section 6.12 shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i) bear
any out-of-pocket cost or expense for which it has not received prior
reimbursement pursuant to Section 6.12(g) or pay any fee in connection with
the Debt Financing, (ii) incur any liability in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time, (iii) enter into any agreement relating
to the Debt Financing that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, or
(iv) take any action that would (A) cause any natural person serving as a
director, manager, partner, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability or (B) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose,
information that reasonably would be expected to result in the waiver of any
attorney-client, work product or other applicable privilege or protection.

(g) The Purchaser shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, (i)
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives in connection with their respective obligations
under this Section 6.12 and (ii) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law from and against any and all
liability suffered, sustained or incurred by, or asserted against, any of
them, directly or indirectly relating to, or arising out of, this Section
6.12, the arrangement of the Debt Financing or providing any of
the information utilized in connection therewith, whether in respect of
direct claims, third-party claims or otherwise, other than to the extent any
of the foregoing arises from (A) the willful breach of the obligations of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives under this
Section 6.12 or any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct,
bad faith or gross negligence of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives or (B) material misstatements or omissions in
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing. The foregoing
obligations in this Section 6.12 shall survive the Closing or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement.

6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. Each Party shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each Party
and its respective board of directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions within its control as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take any action to
exempt any person from, or make any acquisition of securities or Common Stock
of the Company by any person not subject to, any Takeover Statute or similar
Law that applies to the Company except for the Purchaser, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



68 6.14. _No Solicitation_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and each of their Representatives to immediately cease any existing
discussion or negotiation with any Persons (other than the Purchaser)
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any proposed, potential or
contemplated acquisition of all or any portion of the Common Stock, the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in the Ordinary
Course) or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall refrain,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each Representative to refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action (a) to solicit or initiate the
submission of any proposal or indication of interest from any Person (other
than Purchaser) relating to an acquisition of the Common Stock, the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in the Ordinary Course) or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation,
combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Strategic Transaction_
"), (b) to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or that may reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Strategic Transaction with any Person (other than
Purchaser) or (c) to authorize, engage in, or enter into any agreement or
understanding (other than with Purchaser) with respect to a Strategic
Transaction. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) notify Purchaser if any proposals or offers with respect to
an Strategic Transaction are received by, any information with respect to an
Strategic Transaction is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Strategic Transaction are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed Contracts) and thereafter will keep Purchaser promptly informed of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

6.15. _Information Statement_ _; Controlling Stockholder Notice_. On the date
hereof or as soon thereafter as practicable (but in any event prior to the
Closing), the Company shall distribute and/or mail or cause to be distributed
or mailed (including by electronic transmission as permitted) to each
Stockholder (other than those Stockholders who executed the Written Action)
in accordance with Sections 228(e) and 262 of the DGCL an information
statement, which (i) describes the principal terms of this Agreement, (ii)
notifies such Stockholders of the occurrence of (A) the approval of the
Merger and the adoption of this Agreement by the Board, and (B) receipt of the
Required Company Stockholder Approval with respect to the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger and consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 228(e) of
the DGCL, (iii) provides a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and a description
regarding the procedures relating to appraisal rights and dissenters rights
and exercise thereof under the DGCL to the extent such appraisal rights and
dissenters rights are exercisable under the DGCL, (iv) includes the
Controlling Stockholder Notice in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement
and a form of waiver of any rights of the Non-Controlling Stockholders as
Dissenting Stockholders under the DGCL, and (v) contains such other
information as the Company deems appropriate (together with any amendments
or supplements thereto, the " _Information Statement_ "). The Company shall
cause the content and distribution of the Information Statement to comply with
applicable Law, and cause the Information Statement to be accurate and
complete and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in
the light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company has no such responsibility or
liability with respect to

 



69  information or comments provided by the Purchaser for inclusion in the
Information Statement. The Purchaser shall in no way be responsible for any of
the content of the Information Statement, except for information regarding
the Purchaser or the Merger Sub supplied in writing by the Purchaser expressly
for inclusion therein or any comments or information that the Purchaser
requests in writing be included in such Information Statement. The

date may be extended by any Party (by written notice) for an additional period
ending no later than July 30, 2018 in the event that all conditions to
Closing other than those set forth in Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) or

warranties contained herein, which failure or breach would result in the
failure of either of the closing conditions specified in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b), and which failure or breach, if capable of being cured, is not
cured by the earlier of the End Date or within thirty (30) days following the
Company having notified the Purchaser of its intent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d); or

 

(e) by written notice from the Purchaser to the Company, in the event the
Company (i) fails to perform in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein required to be performed by it at or prior to the
Closing or (ii) breaches any of its representations and warranties contained
herein, which failure or breach would result in the failure of either of the
closing conditions specified in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), and which
failure or breach, if capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of
the End Date or within thirty (30) days following the Purchaser having
notified the Company of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(e).

9.2. _Procedures and Effect of Termination_. Any Party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, specifying the
subsection of Section 9.1 pursuant to which the termination is being made and
the facts constituting the basis for such termination. If the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein, (a) the
Purchaser and Merger Sub shall return all documents and other material
received from the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
obtained before or after the execution hereof and (b) all Confidential
Information received by the Purchaser and Merger Sub with respect to the

the termination of this Agreement and (ii) liability of the Company, the
Purchaser or Merger Sub, as the case may be, for any intentional and willful

of doubt, the Parties agree that if the Purchaser does not close the
transactions contemplated hereby in circumstances in which the closing
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or
waived, such election shall be deemed to be a willful breach of this Agreement
and that the Company shall retain all other rights and remedies against the
Purchaser relating to a willful breach by the Purchaser, including specific
performance of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.17 and recovery of
monetary damages. In determining losses or damages recoverable upon
termination by a Party for another Partys breach, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that such losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement
of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and shall include the benefit of the
bargain lost by such Party or, in the case of the Company, the Stockholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including other opportunities and
the time value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages payable to such
Party.

any time only by written agreement signed by the Purchaser, the Surviving

of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the Parties, on
one or more occasions, to

 



80  enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Section 10.10 and Sections 10.5(c), 10.6, 10.9 and 10.18(b) may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

10.11. _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents executed pursuant
hereto supersede all negotiations, agreements and understandings among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (except for the
Confidentiality Agreement) and constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect thereto.

10.12. _Cooperation Following the Closing_. Following the Closing, each Party
shall deliver to the other Parties such further information and documents and
shall execute and deliver to the other Parties such further instruments and
agreements as any other Party shall reasonably request to consummate or
confirm the transactions provided for herein, in each case to the extent
necessary to accomplish the purpose hereof or to assure to any other Party the
benefits hereof.

10.13. _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.14. _Transaction Costs_. Except as provided above or as otherwise
expressly provided herein, (a) each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall pay
its own fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of
its financial advisors, accountants and counsel and (b) the fees, costs and
expenses of the Company incurred in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid for pursuant to Section 3.5 of this
Agreement if the Closing occurs (to the extent then unpaid) and by the Company
if the Closing does not occur; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, (i) the
Company shall reimburse the Stockholder Representative for all costs and
expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
pay all fees and expenses in connection with any financing arrangements and
other activities taken at their direction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
fees and expenses (other than the Companys attorneys fees) related to any
filing made pursuant to the HSR Act or the Competition Act and the fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent shall be paid entirely by
the Purchaser.

 

10.15. _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By the execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, including
counterparts thereof, each of the Stockholders will irrevocably constitute
and appoint Bruce M. Steiner as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact
(the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") of such Stockholder with full powers
of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder with
respect to the performance on behalf of such Stockholder under the terms and
provisions hereof and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and
things, and to execute all such documents, as the Stockholder Representative
shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with any transaction

 



81  contemplated hereunder, including the power to: (i) act for such Stockholder
with respect to the Adjustment Escrow Amount; (ii) amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement in any manner; (iii) employ, obtain and rely upon the advice of
legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as the Stockholder
Representative, in the sole discretion thereof, deems necessary or advisable
in the performance of the duties of the Stockholder Representative; (iv) act
for such Stockholder with respect to all Merger Consideration matters and all
Merger Consideration adjustment matters referred to herein; (v) incur any
expenses, liquidate and withhold assets received on behalf of such Stockholder
prior to their distribution to such Stockholder to the extent of any amount
that the Stockholder Representative deems necessary for payment of or as
a reserve against expenses, and pay such expenses or deposit the same in an
interest-bearing bank account established for such purpose, with all such
expenses reimbursed to the Stockholder Representative out of amounts received
out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, or if no amounts are received, by
reimbursement from the Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Percentage; (vi) receive all notices, communications and deliveries hereunder
on behalf of such Stockholder; (vii) do or refrain from doing any further act
or deed on behalf of such Stockholder that the Stockholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate, in the sole discretion of the Stockholder
Representative, relating to the subject matter hereof as fully and completely
as such Stockholder could do if personally present and acting and as though
any reference to such Stockholder herein was a reference to the Stockholder
Representative; or (viii) direct, authorize or permit the Paying Agent to
take any of the foregoing actions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative shall have no obligation to act, except as
expressly provided herein.

 

(b) The appointment of the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Stockholder Representative as the act of each Stockholder in all matters
referred to herein.

 

(c) In the event the Stockholder Representative resigns or ceases to function
in such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the successor Stockholder
Representative shall be the Person appointed by the Stockholders holding a
majority of the Pro Rata Percentages held by all Stockholders.

 

(d) The Stockholder Representative Reserve shall be used by the Stockholder
Representative to satisfy the obligations of the Stockholder Representative
set forth herein and to otherwise permit the Stockholder Representative to
perform its obligations set forth herein. As soon as practicable after the
date on which the final obligation of the Stockholder Representative under
this Agreement has been discharged, the Stockholder Representative shall pay
to the Paying Agent, which shall be directed to pay the Stockholders in
accordance with Section 2.5(a) (or the Stockholder Representative may deliver
such amounts directly to the Stockholders if the Paying Agent is no longer
engaged or if the Stockholder Representative otherwise so determines) any
amounts remaining in the Stockholder Representative Reserve.

 



82 (e) In furtherance of its role, the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to incur such reasonable costs and expenses as the Stockholder
Representative may deem appropriate under the circumstances, which expenses
may include hiring attorneys, accountants, appraisers and other professional
advisors. Such expenses shall be reimbursed from the Stockholder
Representative Reserve from time to time upon demand by the Stockholder
Representative.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent
Agreement is intended, and nothing in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Paying Agent Agreement shall be interpreted as, imposing upon the
Stockholder Representative, solely in its capacity as the agent and attorney-
in fact for the Stockholders, any personal liability, personal economic
obligation or personal guarantee in favor of any Party to this Agreement or
any third party. The Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to the
Purchaser, the Company or the Stockholders with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative.

10.16. _Concerning the Company_ __ _s Counsel; Attorney Client Privilege_.

(a) The Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Stockholders), the Company and their respective Affiliates acknowledge and
agree that Dorsey and Whitney LLP (" _Prior Company Counsel_ ") have acted as
counsel for the Company and certain of its Affiliates for a number of years
and that, in the event of any post-Closing disputes between the Parties, the
Stockholders reasonably anticipate that Prior Company Counsel may represent
all or certain of them in such matters. Accordingly, the Purchaser, Merger
Sub, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), the
Company and their respective Affiliates expressly consent to Prior Company
Counsels representation of one or more of the Stockholders (or
the Stockholder Representative) in any post-Closing matter in which the
interests of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company on the one hand, and
the Stockholders (or the Stockholder Representative) on the other hand, are
adverse, whether or not such matter is one in which Prior Company Counsel may
have previously advised the Company or its Affiliates and consent to the
disclosure by Prior Company Counsel to the Stockholders (or the Stockholder
Representative) or any of their Affiliates, directors, members, partners,
officers or employees of any information learned by Prior Company Counsel in
the course of its representation of the Company or its Affiliates, whether or
not such information is subject to attorney client privilege or Prior Company
Counsels duty of confidentiality. In connection with the foregoing, the
Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with Prior
Company Counsels representation of any Stockholder or the Stockholder
Representative prior to and after the Closing to the extent that such
representation is in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement.

(b) The Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing,
on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that:

 



83 (i) Deal Communications shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively
by the Stockholders, shall be controlled by the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Stockholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(ii) if any such Deal Communications are attorney-client privileged, then such
Deal Communications shall remain privileged after the Closing and the
privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders, shall be
controlled by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; and

(iii) it will not, and that it will cause the Company and Subsidiaries not
to, (A) access or use attorney client privileged Deal Communications,
including without limitation by way of review of any electronic data,
communications or other information, by seeking the same in discovery or by
seeking to have the Stockholder Representative or any Stockholder waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that the
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to waive the
attorney-client or other privilege or (B) seek to obtain such Deal
Communications from Prior Company Counsel.

 

(c) The Parties understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including
the foregoing provision regarding the ownership and assertion of privilege
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege.
The Parties further understand and agree that the Parties have each undertaken
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-
client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Parties
further understand and agree that the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege. The
Parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of information that
may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice or
otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The Parties agree to
use reasonable best efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed
information to the appropriate Party upon becoming aware of its existence.
This Section 10.16 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.16
may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative and its Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel to the
extent that they are affected thereby.

 

10.17. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Without limitation of all of the cumulative rights and remedies that a
Party may have under this Agreement or to which it is entitled at law or in
equity, including the ability to seek recovery for damages, during the period
from the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing or (ii) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, the remedies of each
Party in the event of a breach by another Party shall include (A) termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX and (B) specific

 



84  performance in accordance with this Section 10.17. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, including a Party failing to take actions as are
required of it under the Agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 

(b) The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections
to the availability of an injunction, the equitable remedy of specific
performance or other equitable remedy to prevent or restrain breaches of this
Agreement by such Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this
Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.17. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of
this Section 10.17. To the extent any Party brings an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision
that expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

10.18. _Non-Recourse_.

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the Persons that
are expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except to the extent
a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not
otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or Representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company or the Purchaser
under this Agreement or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers and employees (in each case, in their respective capacities as such
and prior to the Closing of the Merger)) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source (in their

 



85  capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt
Financing Source (other than in their capacity as agent, lender, swingline
lender, issuing bank, underwriter, purchaser or other similar role under the
definitive documentation actually entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing with respect to which capacity this Section 10.18(b) shall not apply
upon the execution of such definitive documentation) shall have any liability
for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses,
fines or penalties to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and employees (in each case, with respect to such Subsidiaries,
officers, directors and employees prior to the Closing of the Merger) in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated thereby.
