          This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of July
28, 2002, is entered into by and among Genesis Health Ventures, Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), Geneva Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and NCS
HealthCare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and a Special Committee consisting of
independent directors of the Company have approved this Agreement and deem it
advisable and in the best interests of the Company's stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders") to consummate the merger of Sub with and into the Company,
wherein each share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per
share ("Company Class A Common Stock"), and each share of Class B common stock
of the Company, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Class B Common Stock" and,
together with the Company Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the
Company Treasury Shares and the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into a
number of shares of common stock of Parent, par value $0.02 per share ("Parent
Common Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio, on the terms set forth in this
Agreement (the "Merger");

          WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub has
approved this Agreement and deemed it advisable and in the best interests of its
respective stockholders to consummate the Merger on the terms set forth in this
Agreement;

          WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the parties to
this Agreement intend that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Code"); and

          WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as an
inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain Company
Stockholders have entered with the Company and Parent into the Voting Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which such Company Stockholders have
agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of capital stock of the Company
over which such Company Stockholders have voting power to approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

          Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company


                                       -1-
<PAGE>

shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (in such capacity, the Company is sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation").

          Section 1.2. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
closing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") will take place on the fifth business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any such conditions
that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which conditions
shall be required to be so satisfied or waived on the Closing Date), unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, it being
understood that the parties desire to cause the Closing to occur on the first
day of a calendar month, and that the parties shall make reasonable efforts to
accommodate such desire (the actual time and date of the Closing, the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, unless another place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.

          Section 1.3. Effective Time. As promptly as possible on the Closing
Date, the parties to this Agreement shall file with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed
in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
when the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time that the Merger becomes
effective, the "Effective Time").

          Section 1.4. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects as provided for in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, including those set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL.

          Section 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Certificate
of Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the
provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior to the
Effective Time in the certificate of incorporation of Sub (the "Sub Certificate
of Incorporation"), except for Article I thereof, which shall continue to read
"The name of the Corporation is `NCS HealthCare, Inc.'"; and (b) the by-laws of
Sub (the "Sub By-Laws") in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Laws.




                                      -2-
<PAGE>


          Section 1.6. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, (a) the officers of Sub shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation; and (b) the directors of Sub as of the Effective Time
shall serve as directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an
officer or a director, as the case may be, or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

          Section 2.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent
or Sub or their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable:

          (a) Each share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share ("Sub
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share. Such
newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Company Treasury Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.

          (c) Each share of capital stock of the Company held in the treasury of
the Company (the "Company Treasury Shares") shall be cancelled and retired, and
no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

          Section 2.2. Exchange Pool; Exchange Ratio; Fractional Shares;
Adjustments.

          (a) The "Exchange Ratio" shall be 0.1 of a share of Parent Common
Stock. Under no circumstances shall Parent or the Company be required or
obligated to issue in the Merger a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
greater than the number of such shares equal to the sum of (i) the product of
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by 23,716,809 and (ii) to the extent Company
Options are exercised prior to the Closing, such additional number of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon such exercise (which shall not exceed
2,517,582 shares of Company Common Stock).

          (b) No certificates for fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued as a result of the conversion provided for in Section 2.1(b), and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or have
any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


          (c) In lieu of any such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, each
Company Stockholder who holds a certificate or certificates (each, a
"Certificate") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and who otherwise would have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of such
Company Stockholder's Certificates (determined after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such Company Stockholder) shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment therefor in an amount equal to the value (determined with
reference to the closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq
Stock Market, Inc.'s National Market (the "Nasdaq") on the last full trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date) of such fractional share. Such payment
with respect to fractional shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical
rounding off, and is not a separately bargained for, consideration. If more than
one certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be surrendered
for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for which certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of
the aggregate number of shares represented by the certificates so surrendered.

          (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any
other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio set forth in this Section
2.2 shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the Company Stockholders and
holders of Company Stock Options the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

          Section 2.3. Exchange of Certificates.

          (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with Mellon Investor Services LLC or such other exchange agent as
may be designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.3,
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund").

          (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate,
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in
exchange for a certificate or certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of the
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate
or certificates representing that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that the Company Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 in
such denominations and registered in such names as the Company Stockholder may
request and (B) a check representing the


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, that the Company
Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II, after giving effect to any required withholding Tax. The shares of Company
Common Stock represented by the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, payable to the Company Stockholders. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered on the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a
check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, may be
issued to the transferee if the Certificate held by the transferee is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect the transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as
provided in this Article II. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by the Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and unpaid dividends and distributions
on the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, as provided in this Article II.

          (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock
having a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section 2.3. Subject to the
effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of a Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding
Taxes that may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required
thereon.

          (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and, as of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the



                                      -5-
<PAGE>

Company of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.3. A Certificate surrendered for exchange by any
Person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received written undertakings from such Person in the form attached
to this Agreement as Exhibit B.

          (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders six months after the date
of the mailing required by Section 2.3(b) shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand thereby, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied
with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any
claim to shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares
thereof, or dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof, or any other
consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

          (f) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to whole shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Laws, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

          (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash balances in the Exchange Fund as a result of Section 2.2(c), as directed by
Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 2.3(e).

          (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

          Section 2.4. Treatment of Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to cause
each unexpired and unexercised outstanding option granted or issued under the
Company stock option or equity-incentive plans in effect on the date of this
Agreement (each, a "Company Option") to be



                                      -6-
<PAGE>

automatically converted at the Effective Time into an option (a "Parent Exchange
Option") to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (and
rounded to the nearest share or zero if less than 0.5), with an exercise price
per share equal to the exercise price per share that existed under the
corresponding Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (and rounded to the
nearest whole cent), and with other terms and conditions that are the same as
the terms and conditions of the Company Option immediately before the Effective
Time and taking into account any acceleration of vesting resulting from the
consummation of this Agreement pursuant to such pre-existing terms and
conditions; provided that, with respect to any Company Option that is an
"incentive stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code), the
foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner satisfying the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

          Section 2.5. Dissenting Shares.

          (a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a Company
Stockholder who (i) has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger, (ii) shall
have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in the manner
provided for in the DGCL and (iii) shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost
such right to appraisal as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares"),
shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
to payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall
receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the
DGCL; provided, however, that (A) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have failed to establish such holder's entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, (B) if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his Dissenting Shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL or (C) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares
nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition demanding a
determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided for
the filing of such petition in Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and the holder of each
such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.1 hereof, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.3 hereof, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares.

          (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL (it being understood that the Company shall be entitled
to participate therein). The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

provision of its certificate of incorporation, as amended (the "Parent
Certificate of Incorporation"), or its by-laws, as amended (the "Parent
By-Laws"), and Sub is not in default in the performance, observance or

Stock to be issued in the Merger, and (b) the proxy statement and form of
proxies relating to the vote of the Company Stockholders with respect to this

Meeting will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make

not misleading. The Registration Statement, except for such portions thereof
that relate only to the Company and its Subsidiaries, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act.

compliance with, all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or Orders entered by
any Governmental Authority (collectively, "Applicable Laws") relating to Parent,
its securities, business or properties, except where the failure to be in
compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except
as set forth in Section 3.7 to the Parent Disclosure Schedule or in the Parent
SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries is pending,
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority
indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same, other than those the
outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          Section 3.8. Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 3.8 to the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, (a) there is no suit, arbitration, inquiry,
prosecution, claim, action, proceeding, hearing, notice of violation, demand
letter or investigation by, of, in or before any Governmental Authority (an

any executive officer or director of Parent that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, and (b) Parent is not subject to any outstanding Order that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          Section 3.9. Absence of Changes. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 to
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and except for liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, since October 2, 2001, there has been no change, event, development,

subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not (a) engaged in any
business activities, (b) conducted any operations other than in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or (c) incurred any liabilities other than
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent, as Sub's sole
stockholder, has approved Sub's execution of this Agreement.

          Section 3.11. Reorganization. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge
of Parent and Sub after due inquiry, none of Parent and Sub or any Affiliate of
Parent or Sub has taken or agreed to take any action, failed to take any action,
or is aware of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

          Section 3.12. Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) as and to the extent
disclosed or reserved against on the balance sheet of Parent at March 31, 2002

Parent or Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement, Parent does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          Section 4.3. Corporate Power and Authority. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to
receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, subject to adoption by the Company
Stockholders of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

          Section 4.4. Capitalization of the Company. As of July 28, 2002, the
Company's authorized capital stock consisted solely of (i) 50,000,000 shares of
Company Class A Common Stock, of which (A) 18,461,599 shares were issued and
outstanding, (B) no shares were issued and held in treasury, (C) 2,422,724
shares were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of Company Options, and (D)
1,477,276 shares were reserved for future issuance under the existing plans of
the Company that provide for the issuance of Company Options; (ii) 20,000,000
shares of Company Class B Common Stock, of which (X) 5,255,210 shares were
issued and outstanding and (Y) 94,858 shares were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of Company Options; and (iii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which no shares were issued and outstanding. Each
outstanding share of Company capital stock is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and has not been issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar rights. The Company Class A Common Stock and the Company
Class B Common Stock are identical in all respects except that (I) each share of
Company Class A Common Stock is entitled to 1 vote per share, whereas each share
of Company Class B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes per share; (II) the
Company Class A

<PAGE>

Common Stock is not convertible into another security, whereas the Company Class
B Common Stock is convertible into shares of Company Class A Common Stock on a
one-for-one basis; and (III) the Company Class B Common Stock is subject to
certain transfer restrictions to which the Company Class A Common Stock is not
subject. The Company has not taken any action or made any determination,
pursuant to Section 7(i) of the Company Certificate of Incorporation, that the
restrictions on transfer or other provisions set forth in Section 7 of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation have a material adverse effect on
liquidity, marketability or market value of the outstanding shares of Company
Class A Common Stock. Other than as set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 4.4 or in Section 4.4 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements,
understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of any securities of the Company, nor
are there outstanding any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable
for any shares of Company capital stock, and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to issue any additional securities
or to pay for or repurchase any securities of the Company or its predecessors.
The issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital stock described in this
Section 4.4 have been in compliance in all material respects with United States
federal and state securities laws. Section 4.4 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule accurately sets forth the names of, and the number of shares of each
class (including the number of shares issuable upon exercise of Company Options
and the exercise price and vesting schedule with respect thereto) and the number
of options held by all holders of options to purchase Company capital stock.
Except as set forth in Section 4.4 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has not agreed to register any securities under the Securities Act or
under any state securities law or granted registration rights to any Person;
complete and correct copies of any such agreements have previously been made
available to Parent. Except as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding stock-appreciation rights,
security-based performance units, "phantom" stock or other security rights or
other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to which any Person is or may be entitled to receive any
payment or other value based on the revenues, earnings or financial performance,
stock price performance or other attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or assets or calculated in accordance therewith (other than
ordinary course payments or commissions to sales representatives of the
Company). The holders of Company Common Stock who have executed Voting
Agreements with Parent hold a majority of the voting power of the Company Common
Stock as of the date hereof.

          Section 4.5. Conflicts; Consents and Approvals.

          (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does
not, and the performance and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions

          Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws;

                    (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any
          provision of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with the

          default) under, or entitle any Person (with the giving of


                                      -14-

          modify or call a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien
          upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
          Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
          note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, contract,
          undertaking, agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to
          which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; or

                    (iii) violate any Applicable Laws relating to the Company,
          any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
          assets;

except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any of the foregoing
disclosed in Section 4.5(a) to the Company Disclosure Schedule or that could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does
not, and the performance and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

imposed by, or make any filing with or notification to or seek any approval or
authorization from any Governmental Authority other than (i) the Required
Company Stockholders Approval, (ii) actions required by the HSR Act, (iii)

agreements relating to such matters disclosed thereon having previously been
provided to Parent), none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any director,
officer or employee of the Company, has incurred or will incur on behalf of the
Company, any brokerage, finders', advisory or similar fees in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 4.6 to the Company
Disclosure Schedule discloses the maximum aggregate amount of all fees and
expenses that will be paid or will be payable by the Company to all brokers,
finders, advisors, attorneys, accountants and investment bankers in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and
expenses payable by the Company in respect of the holders of the 5 3/4%
convertible subordinated debentures, due 2004, of the Company (the "Notes") as
of the Closing Date or, thereafter, as a result of the Closing.

          Section 4.7. Company SEC Documents. The Company has filed with the
Commission all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it since January 1, 2000 under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act (such documents, as supplemented and amended since the time of
filing, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). The Company SEC Documents,
including any financial statements or schedules included in the Company SEC
Documents, at the time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
respectively and, in the case of any Company SEC Document amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
amending or superseding filing) (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to

<PAGE>

be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (b)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. The financial
statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents at the time
filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively and, in the case
of any the Company SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding filing)
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with
respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the Commission), and fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended. None of the Company's Subsidiaries is
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required
to file any form, report or other document with the Commission, the Nasdaq, any
stock exchange or any other comparable Governmental Authority.

          Section 4.8. Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in (a) the Registration
Statement at the time that it becomes effective, and (b) the Proxy Statement, at
the date of mailing and at the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement, except for such portions thereof that relate
only to Parent and its Subsidiaries, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

          Section 4.9. Compliance with Law. Except as set forth in Section 4.9
to the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Documents filed prior
to the date hereof, the Company is in compliance and, at all times, has been in
compliance with Applicable Laws relating to the Company or its business or
properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with such Applicable
Laws, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as disclosed in Section 4.9 to
the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Company, to the knowledge of the Company, is pending or
threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated in writing to the
Company an intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, except
as disclosed in Section 4.9 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is, and has been since July 1, 2001, in substantial
compliance with the Company's policies (as in effect on the date hereof) with
respect to the recording and issuing of all credits due to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, copies of which policies have been made available prior to

director of the Company that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably

Company is not subject to any outstanding Order that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the

conducted its business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with

the Company in its accounting methods, principles or practices, any revaluation
by the Company of any of its assets, including writing down the value of
inventory or writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.

          Section 4.12. Taxes.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.12 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all material Tax Returns
(including those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to
have been filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries. All of such Tax Returns are
true, complete and correct as to the amount of Tax shown to be due thereon
(except for such inaccuracies that are, individually or in the aggregate, not
material), and the Company and its Subsidiaries have within the time and manner
prescribed by Applicable Laws paid or, prior to the Effective Time, will pay all
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns. Except as disclosed in Section 4.12
to the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability for any Taxes in excess of the amounts
paid (or reserved, in accordance with GAAP, as reflected on the Company SEC
Documents, as adjusted for operations in the ordinary course of business since
the date of such Company SEC Documents), and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any material Tax. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or filed any document having
the effect of causing any extension of time within which to file any material
Tax Returns in respect of any fiscal year that have not since been filed. Except
as set forth in Section 4.12 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, no deficiencies
for any material Tax have been proposed, asserted or assessed (tentatively or
definitely), in each case in writing, by any Governmental Authority, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which there are not adequate reserves, in
accordance with GAAP, as reflected on the Company SEC Documents. Except as set
forth in Section 4.12 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any currently ongoing Tax audit.
Except as set forth in Section 4.12 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
are no pending requests for waivers of the time to assess any material Tax,
other than those made in the ordinary course and for which either payment has
been made or there are adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP as reflected on
the Company SEC Documents. With respect to any taxable period ended on or prior
to June 30, 1996, all United States federal income Tax Returns including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue
Service or are closed by the


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

applicable statute of limitations. Except as set forth in Section 4.12 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no
liens with respect to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or
personal, tangible or intangible of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than liens for Taxes not yet due). Except as set forth in Section 4.12 to
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no material claim (that is currently pending or
that has been made on or after June 30, 2000) has been made in writing by an
authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not (or a Subsidiary does
not) file Tax Returns asserting that the Company (or such Subsidiary) is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The Company has not filed an
election under Section 341(f) of the Code to be treated as a consenting
corporation.

          (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.12 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated by any
contract, agreement or other arrangement to indemnify any other Person (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect to material Taxes. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are or were a party to or bound by any
agreement or arrangement (whether or not written and including any arrangement
required or permitted by law) that (i) requires the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any Tax payment to or for the account of any Person (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), (ii) affords any other Person the
benefit of any net operating loss, net capital loss, investment Tax credit,
foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or any other credit or Tax attribute
that could reduce Taxes (including deductions and credits related to alternative
minimum Taxes) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) requires or
permits the transfer or assignment of income, revenues, receipts or gains to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Person.

          (c) The Company is not and has not been a United State real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during
the applicable period described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended
to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two
years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation
in the two years prior to the Closing Date) or (ii) in a distribution that
otherwise constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
Merger.

          (e) The net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") for United States
federal income tax purposes of the consolidated group of which the Company is
the common parent as of June 30, 2001 are not less than $125,000,000, and,
except for limitations that may apply by reason of the Merger, such NOLs are not
subject to any material limitation under Section 382 of the Code, Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-15, -21 or otherwise.

          (f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or other third party.

otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use, all patents, trademarks,
trade names, service marks, copyrights and mask works, any applications for and

copyrights and mask works, and all processes, formulae, methods, schematics,
technology, know-how, computer software programs or applications and tangible or
intangible trade secrets, proprietary information or material ("Intellectual
Property") that are necessary to conduct the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except for such Intellectual Property the
absence of which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (b) The Company is not, nor will it as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the performance of the Company's obligations under
this Agreement or otherwise be, in breach of or otherwise cause the termination

Intellectual Property, or any licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third-party
patents, trademarks or copyrights, including software that is used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those the breach of which could

Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (c) To the knowledge of the Company, all patents, trademarks, service
marks (or any applications or registrations therefor) and copyrights that are
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and that are material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such business is presently
conducted, and all Intellectual Property rights pertaining to the Material
Company-Owned Software, are current, in effect, valid and subsisting. The
Company (i) has not been party to any Action still pending that involves a claim
of infringement by the Company of any Intellectual Property right of any third
party; and (ii) has no knowledge that the marketing, licensing or sale of its
services infringes any Intellectual Property right of any third party, except as
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (d) The Company has a policy of requiring all employees to enter into
appropriate confidentiality agreements in order to maintain the secrecy and
confidentiality of all of the Company's material Intellectual Property
(including the Material Company-Owned Software),

                                      -19-
<PAGE>


and has done so in all cases except where the failure to do so could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(e) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has good and marketable title to, has the full right to
use and owns solely and outright, all of the software products known as

operational, under development, superseded or inactive, including all object
code, source code, system and database architecture, design features, technical
manuals, test scripts, user manuals and other documentation therefor, whether in
machine-readable form, programming language or any other language or symbols,
and whether stored, encoded, recorded or written on disk, tape, film, memory
device, paper or other media of any nature and any data bases necessary to
operate any such computer program, operating system, application system,
firmware or software (all of the foregoing is collectively referred to as the
"Material Company-Owned Software"), as relating to the Company's and its
Affiliates' respective businesses as conducted by the Company and its Affiliates
at all times on and before the Effective Time, free and clear of any liens,
licenses (other than written license agreements with customers entered into by
the Company in the ordinary course of business and in the form provided by the
Company to Parent) or other encumbrances which would in any way limit or
restrict the Company's ability to market, license, sell, modify, update, and/or
create derivative works for, the Material Company-Owned Software. The Material
Company-Owned Software does not incorporate or embody any third-party
Intellectual Property.

          (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(f) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the extent that any author or developer of any Material
Company-Owned Software was not a regular full-time employee of the Company or
its predecessors working within the scope of his or her employment with the
Company or its predecessors, at the time such Person contributed to the creation
or modification of any Material Company-Owned Software, such author or developer
has irrevocably assigned to the Company or its predecessors, as applicable, in
writing all copyrights, patent rights, trade secrets and other Intellectual
Property in such Person's work with respect to such Material Company-Owned
Software. None of the Material Company-Owned Software is owned by or registered
in the name of any current or former owner, shareholder, partner, director,
executive, officer, employee, salesman, agent, customer, representative or
contractor of the Company, any of its predecessors or any third Person, nor do
such have any interest therein or right thereto, including the right to royalty
payments.

          (g) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Material
Company-Owned Software or its respective past or current uses, including the
preparation, distribution, marketing or licensing thereof, has violated or

          Section 4.14. Title to and Condition of Properties.

          (a) The Company owns or holds under valid leases all real property and
all properties, assets and equipment necessary for the conduct of the business
of the Company as presently conducted, except where the failure to own or hold
such real property, properties, assets and equipment would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

          (b) Section 4.14(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list and description of all real property and interests in
real property owned in fee by the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real
Property") and the address thereof. Except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) to
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries holds
good and marketable fee title to each of the Owned Real Property, free and clear
of any liens, mortgages, easements, rights-of-way, licenses, use restrictions,
claims, charges, options, title defects or encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever, except for the Permitted Encumbrances. All aspects of the Owned Real
Property are in compliance in all material respects with any and all
restrictions and other provisions included in the Permitted Encumbrances, and
there are no matters that create, or that with notice or the passage of time
would create, a default under any of the documents evidencing the Permitted
Encumbrances. As used herein, the term "Permitted Encumbrances" means (i) liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith and
by appropriate proceedings; (ii) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics',
materialmen's, repairmen's or other like liens arising in the ordinary course of
business that are less than $10,000 in amount; or (iii) easements,
rights-of-way, encroachments, restrictions, conditions and other similar
encumbrances of record or incurred or suffered in the ordinary course of
business and that, individually or in the aggregate, (A) are not substantial in
amount in relation to the applicable Owned Real Property; and (B) do not
materially detract from the use, utility or value of the applicable Owned Real
Property or otherwise materially impair the Company's present business
operations at such location.

          (c) All leases pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries leases real property are valid and effective and in accordance with
their respective terms, and there is not, under any such lease, any existing
default or event of default by the Company or its Subsidiaries (or event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default by the
Company or its Subsidiaries), except where such default could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of
the Company, the Company has all permits or licenses necessary to use its leased
real property, except where the failure to obtain such permits or licenses could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          Section 4.15. Employee Benefit Plans.

          (c) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination
letter with respect to each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code) (a "Qualified Plan"), and all
applicable foreign qualifications or registration requirements have been
satisfied with respect to any Plan maintained outside the United States. There
are no existing circumstances nor any events that have occurred that would be
reasonably


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or

be corrected without material liability.

          (d) All material contributions required to be made by the Company or

by Applicable Laws or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding
any Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been made in a
substantially timely manner or paid in full and through the Closing Date will be
made in a substantially timely manner or paid in full. There are no Plans or
related trusts maintained outside the United States.

          (e) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(e) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates
have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations (including any local
Applicable Laws) applicable to the Plans. Each Plan has been operated in
material compliance with its terms. There is not now, and there are no existing
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement
for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the imposition of any Lien
on assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the Code, or similar Applicable Laws of foreign
jurisdictions.

          (f) No Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code. No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two
or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), nor
has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, at any time within six years before the date of this Agreement,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan.

          (g) There does not now exist, and there are no existing circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in, any material Controlled Group
Liability that would be a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section
4204 of ERISA other than transactions that are not likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries.

          (h) Except as set forth in Section 4.15(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar state laws, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability for life, health,
medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof.

          (i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation
of the transactions



                                      -23-
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement nor any shareholder, board or other approval of
such transactions will result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of,
or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 4.15(i) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no amount paid or payable by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other events, will be an "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). The maximum aggregate dollar
value of all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
their directors, officers, employees and consultants pursuant to all employment,
consulting, severance, salary continuation, change in control, parachute or
similar agreements or Plans (all such arrangements, the "Section 4.15(i)
Arrangements"), excluding any obligations of the Company with respect to
continuation of specific retirement and welfare benefits as provided for in the
Section 4.15(i) Arrangements and assuming in each case the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, where relevant, the termination
(or constructive termination, as the case may be) of such directors, officers,
employees or consultants effective as of the Closing Date, does not exceed the
amount set forth in Section 4.15(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
names of all such directors, officers, employees or consultants who are parties
to or beneficiaries of the Section 4.15(i) Arrangements (other than the
broadbased Severance Benefit Plan, effective February 20, 1998) are set forth in
Section 4.15(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened Actions (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that
have been asserted or instituted against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of the Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the United States Department of Treasury, the United
States Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan, or to comparable entities
or Plans under Applicable Laws of jurisdictions outside the United States.

          (k) No material disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of
the Code for employee reimbursement of any amount paid or payable by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur.

          Section 4.16. Contracts.

          (a) All material contracts required to be filed prior to the date
hereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Regulation S-K have
been filed as exhibits to, or incorporated by reference in, a Company SEC
Document filed after December 31, 2001 and prior to the date hereof (such
agreements, the "Company SEC Agreements"). Except as entered into after the date
hereof in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Section 4.16 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists all written or oral contracts, agreements,
guarantees, leases and executory commitments other than Plans (each a
"Contract"), other than any Contract that is a Company SEC Agreement, that fall
within any of the following categories:

          untrue statement of a material fact or fraudulent statement to the
          United States Food and Drug Administration, (the "FDA") or any other
          Governmental Authorities, or failed to disclose a material fact

Schedule, to the extent necessary to operate the Company's business as presently
conducted, the Company and its Subsidiaries are certified for participation and
reimbursement under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (the
"Medicare and Medicaid Programs" and, together with such other similar federal,
state or local reimbursement or governmental programs for which the Company and
its Subsidiaries are eligible, the "Government Programs") and have current
provider agreements for such Government Programs and, to the knowledge of the
Company, except where the failure to so have could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, with such private non-governmental programs, including any private
insurance program under which they, directly or indirectly, are presently
receiving payments (such non-governmental programs, the "Private Programs"). Set
forth in Schedule 4.19(c) to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a correct and
complete list of such authorizations and provider agreements under all of the
Government Programs, complete and correct copies of which have been provided to
the Parent. True, complete and correct copies of all surveys of the Company, its

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

Action pending or recommended by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over any of the Company Permits or the items listed in Section 4.19(c) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, either to revoke, withdraw or suspend any license,
right or authorization, or to terminate the participation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in any of the Government Programs or the Private Programs.
To the knowledge of the Company, and except as could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prejudice the ability of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to obtain any necessary licenses or permits as of and after the
Closing or to materially interfere with or limit the business of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Closing on an ongoing basis, no event has occurred
that, with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute
grounds for a violation, order or deficiency with respect to any of the Company
Permits or the items listed in Section 4.19(c)(ii) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or to terminate or modify the participation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in any of the Government Programs or the Private Programs.
Except as listed in Section 4.19(d) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the
knowledge of the Company, there has been no decision not to renew any provider
or third-party payor agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Authority, and no consent or approval of, prior filing with or
notice to, or any Action by, any Governmental Authority or any other third party

Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports
and billings required to be filed by it prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Government Programs and the Private Programs, all fiscal intermediaries
and other insurance carriers and all such reports and billings are complete and
accurate in all material respects and have been prepared in compliance with all
Applicable Laws governing reimbursement and payment claims, except for failures
that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. True and complete copies of such
reports and billings for the most recent year have heretofore been made
available to Parent. Except as set forth in Section 4.19(e) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid or caused
to be paid all known and undisputed refunds, overpayments, discounts or
adjustments that have become due pursuant to such reports and billings and has
no unpaid liability under any of the Government Programs or the Private Programs
for any refund, overpayment, discount or adjustment, except for failures to pay
that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.19(e)

          Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (C) act
          in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in
          connection with any such filing (including, with respect to the party
          making a filing, providing copies of all such documents to the
          non-filing party and its advisors reasonably prior to filing and, if
          requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
          suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving
          any investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other
          Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any
          such filing or any such transaction. To the extent not prohibited by
          Applicable Laws, each party to this Agreement shall use all reasonable
          efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
          application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Laws
          in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
          Each party to this Agreement shall give the other parties to this
          Agreement reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any
          proposed understanding, undertaking, or agreement with, any
          Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such
          transaction. None of the parties to this Agreement shall independently
          participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation,
          with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
          investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties to

          and/or


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

          participate. The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate
          with one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
          presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
          made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in
          connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other
          Antitrust Laws.

                    (ii) Subject to Section 5.1(a)(iv), each of Parent and the
          Company shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve such objections,
          if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
          to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, under the HSR Act,
          the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
          Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal
          or state or foreign statues, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
          administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed
          to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
          of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust
          Laws"). In connection therewith and subject to Section 5.1(a)(iv), if
          any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
          any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or
          violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall
          cooperate and use all reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and
          resist such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
          overturned any Order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
          is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts
          consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
          including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
          administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative
          action, unless Parent determines that litigation is not in its best
          interests. Subject to Section 5.1(a)(iv), each of Parent and the
          Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
          required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR
          Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the
          execution of this Agreement.

                    (iii) Subject to Section 5.1(a)(iv) below, each of the
          parties to this Agreement agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
          take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
          done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to this
          Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
          consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
          practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
          including (A) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or
          nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations,
          orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of

          with Governmental Authorities, if any), (B) the obtaining of all
          consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or
          required in connection with the Merger that are necessary to
          consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required
          to prevent a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company from
          occurring prior to or after the Effective Time, (C) the preparation of
          the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, (D) the execution
          and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
          consummate the transaction contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
          purposes of, this Agreement, and (E) the providing of all such
          information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates
          and its Subsidiaries' and Affiliates' officers, directors, employees
          and partners as may be


                                      -34-

          reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth
          in this paragraph (iii).

          Subsidiaries shall agree to hold separate (including by trust or
          otherwise) or to divest any of their respective businesses,
          Subsidiaries or assets, or to take or agree to take any action with
          respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any of their respective
          businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, provided that any such action is
          conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company agrees
          and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
          this Section 5.1(a), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
          shall, without Parent's prior written consent, agree to hold separate
          (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
          businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, or to take or agree to take any
          action with respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any of their
          respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets. Anything to the
          contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, Parent and its
          Subsidiaries shall not be required to hold separate (including by
          trust or otherwise) or to divest any of the respective businesses,
          Subsidiaries or assets of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries and/or
          the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, or to take or agree to take
          any action with respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any of
          their respective businesses in order to satisfy any of their
          respective obligations under this Agreement, including under this
          Section 5.1.

          (b) Public Announcements. The initial press release concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release.
Unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, the Company shall
consult with, and use all reasonable efforts to accommodate the comments
(including as to timing) of Parent, and the Parent shall consult with, and use
all reasonable efforts to accommodate the comments (including as to timing) of
the Company before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

          (c) Registration Statement; Other Filings; Board Recommendations.

                    (i) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
          Agreement, the Company and Parent will cooperate in preparing and will
          file with the Commission the Registration Statement, which shall
          include the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent will
          respond jointly and promptly to any comments of the Commission, will
          use all reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
          effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
          such filing, and the Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be
          mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest practicable time
          after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the
          Commission. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
          Agreement, each of the Company and Parent will prepare and file any
          other documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act, the
          Securities Act or any other federal, state, foreign or Blue Sky or
          related laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated
          by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). No amendment or supplement to
          the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by the
          Company or Parent, without the prior approval of the other party
          except as required by Applicable Laws, and then only to the



                                      -35-
<PAGE>

          extent necessary. Each of the Company and Parent will notify the other
          promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the Commission or its
          staff or any other government officials and of any request by the
          Commission or its staff or any other government officials for
          amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Proxy
          Statement or any Other Filings or for additional information and will
          supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party
          or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the Commission, or
          its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
          respect to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Merger
          or any Other Filing. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be
          set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
          Registration Statement or any Other Filing, the Company or Parent, as
          the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
          cooperate in filing with the Commission or its staff or any other
          Governmental Authority, and/or mailing to the Company Stockholders,
          such amendment or supplement.

                    (ii) The Company Board Recommendation shall be included in
          the Proxy Statement, except that the Board of Directors of the Company
          may withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent such
          recommendation only if the Board of Directors of the Company
          determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
          counsel, that such action is required in order for the directors of
          the Company to comply with their fiduciary duties to those Persons to
          whom the Board of Directors of the Company owes fiduciary duties under
          Applicable Laws.

                    (i) Parent shall, promptly upon receiving knowledge thereof,

          inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect or (B) constitute or
          result in a breach by Parent of, or a failure by Parent to comply

          shall be deemed to avoid or cure any such misrepresentation or breach.

          result in a breach by the Company of, or a failure by the Company to

          in breach of this Section 5.3(c) for or in respect of all of the
          outstanding Company capital stock and all of the outstanding Notes, on
          terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its
          good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors
          and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
          Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement deemed relevant by such Board
          of Directors, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
          provisions, conditions to and expected timing and risks of
          consummation, and the ability of the party making such proposal to
          obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal and taking into account
          all other legal, financial, regulatory and all other aspects of such
          proposal) are more favorable to the persons to whom it owes fiduciary
          duties under Applicable Laws than the Merger.

          (d) Affiliates of the Company. The Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause each such person that may be at the Effective Time or was on
the date hereof an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act to execute and deliver to Parent, not less than 30 days prior to
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the written undertakings in the
form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B (the "Company Affiliate Letter").
No later than 45 days prior to such date, the Company, after consultation with
its outside counsel, shall provide Parent with a letter (reasonably satisfactory
to outside counsel to Parent) specifying all of the Persons who, in the
Company's opinion, may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company under the
preceding sentence. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled to
place legends as specified in the Company Affiliate Letter on the certificates
evidencing any of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by (i) any
such affiliate of the Company specified in such letter or (ii) any Person that
Parent reasonably identifies (by written notice to the Company) as being a
Person that may be deemed an affiliate, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
the shares of Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Company
Affiliate Letters, regardless of whether such Person has executed a Company
Affiliate Letter and regardless of whether such Person's name appears on the
letter to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence.

          (e) Access. Subject to contractual restrictions existing as of the
date hereof and legal restrictions (including, without limitation, under
Antitrust Laws), upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the Outside Date, the Company shall permit
representatives of Parent to have full access during normal business hours to
the Company's premises, properties, personnel (including senior executives),
books, records, contracts and documents; provided, however, that such access
shall be conducted in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the
Company's business. Parent will keep the information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.3(e) confidential pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement
related to confidentiality, dated as of January 11, 2002, by and between Parent
and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and shall cause its directors,
officers and employees and representatives or advisors who receive any portion
thereof to keep all such information confidential, in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation conducted pursuant to this
Section 5.3(e) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement.

          (f) Closing Inventory. Parent, Sub and their representatives
(including their outside auditors) shall be permitted to monitor the Company's
regularly scheduled monthly inventories between the date hereof and the Closing.
The inventories shall be undertaken in accordance with the procedures in
Schedule 5.3(f), unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The Company shall
conduct (and Parent, Sub and their representatives (including their outside
auditors) shall be permitted to monitor) a physical inventory in conjunction
with the preparation of the Company's September monthly financial statement at
locations specified by Parent representing approximately 15% of the Company's
inventory balance (which locations shall be in addition to those locations
included in the Company's existing cycle count schedule, which Parent is
entitled to monitor pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph), as well
as a physical inventory at the Vanguard packaging facility.

          (g) Closing Cash on Hand. On the date that is two business days prior
to the Closing Date (the "Cash Test Date"), and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Exhibit C, the Company's independent outside auditor
shall determine the amount of cash on hand of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis as of the open of business on the Cash Test Date (the
"Cash Determination"). The Company and its representatives and Parent and Sub
and their representatives (including their outside auditors) shall be permitted
to monitor and comment upon the Cash Determination. At the Closing, an executive
officer of the Company shall deliver a certificate setting forth the amount of
Cash on Hand as of the Cash Test Date (the "Measured Cash"), signed by such
officer on behalf of the Company, certifying that the amount of the Cash on Hand
set forth in such certificate is materially accurate. From the date prior to the
Cash Test Date through and including the Effective Time, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall make (i) any payment that is outside of the
ordinary course consistent with past practice as to timing or amount to any
Affiliate of the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor (ii) any payment, whether in
respect of fees or expenses or otherwise, to any broker, finder, attorney,
accountant, investment banker or other advisor, nor (iii) any payment that is
outside of the ordinary course consistent with past practice as to timing or
amount to any supplier or vendor.

          (h) Subsequent Financial Statements. The Company shall provide Parent
with its financial results for any period after the date of this Agreement and
prior to filing any Company SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement.

          (i) Disposal of Illinois Sub. If requested in writing by Parent, the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to (and, if necessary, shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause any relevant Subsidiary to) sell or dispose of all
of its right, title and interest in NCS Healthcare of Illinois, Inc. (the
"Illinois Sub"), including all shares of the capital stock and any other debt or
equity interests in the Illinois Sub, on such terms and conditions as Parent may
so specify in writing, including as to the retention of liability, it being
understood that, for purposes of this Section 5.3(i), the concept of all
reasonable efforts shall be understood in light of the terms and conditions
imposed by Parent and the time available between the date Parent delivers its
written request and the Closing Date.

          (j) Lease Consents. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company or its
relevant Subsidiary shall obtain any consent necessary as a result of the
execution, delivery, performance or consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to the leases set forth in Section
4.5(a) to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

part of any party to this Agreement or their respective directors, officers, or
stockholders or shareholders, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party to this Agreement of
liability for willful breach; provided, however, that, if it shall be judicially
determined that termination of this Agreement was caused by a willful breach of
this Agreement, then, in addition to other remedies at law or equity for breach
of this Agreement, the party to this Agreement found to have intentionally
breached this Agreement shall indemnify and hold harmless the other parties to

Subsidiaries) or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being understood
that in the event that the Board of Directors of the Company recommends the
acceptance by the Company Stockholders of a tender offer or note exchange offer
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, such recommendation shall be treated as
though an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal had been entered
into on such date), the Company shall pay to Parent, not later than the date
such agreement is entered into (or, if no agreement is entered into, the date
such transaction is consummated), an amount in cash equal to the Termination

7.2, a proposal or offer will be deemed to have been publicly disclosed, without
limitation, if it becomes known to holders of a majority of the voting power of
the Company Common Shares.

          (c) If:

                    (i) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
          pursuant to Section 7.1(b), and the Order giving rise to such
          termination right shall have been entered by a Bankruptcy Court, or

                    (ii) the Closing does not occur on or prior to the Outside
          Date or either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
          pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and, at such time, each of the conditions
          to the Company's obligations to complete the Merger set forth in
          Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those conditions, such as Section
          6.2(c), that are to be satisfied by action to be taken at the Closing,
          and other than those conditions that are not satisfied as a result of
          an Action or Order of a Bankruptcy Court or the failure of the Company
          to comply with any of its agreements, covenant or obligations

          Section 7.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
to this Agreement, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that by
law requires further approval or authorization by the Company Stockholders
without such further approval or authorization. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties to this Agreement.

          Section 7.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective

Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The headings, the table of contents and the index of
defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." When a reference is made in this Agreement to the Company, such
reference shall be deemed to include any and all of the Company's Subsidiaries,
individually and in the aggregate. Nothing set forth on any Company Disclosure

wrongdoing. If the end date for any time period or deadline set in this
Agreement shall fall on a weekend or legal holiday, then such end date or
deadline shall be deemed to fall on the next business day following such weekend
or holiday.

          (b) Information to be disclosed in any section of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall be
deemed to be disclosed for purposes of any other section of such disclosure
schedule so long as the applicability or relevance to such other section is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Capitalized terms used in
the Parent Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule not otherwise
defined therein have the meaning given them in this Agreement. The foregoing
notwithstanding, each of Sections 3.5 and 3.9 of this Agreement may be modified
only by the information set forth in Sections 3.5 and 3.9, respectively, to the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, and each of Sections 4.7 and 4.11 of this Agreement
may only be modified by the information set forth in Sections 4.7 and 4.11,
respectively, to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          Section 8.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The

of which shall constitute an original.

          Section 8.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
and the instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement), the

agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties to
this Agreement, written and oral, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and thereof.

express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to create any third-party
beneficiaries.

          Section 8.7. Governing Law. Except to the extent that the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of any party to this Agreement, or any other
jurisdiction, are mandatorily applicable to the Merger or to matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdictions) that would cause application of the laws of any jurisdiction

                                      -53-

other than the State of Delaware. All actions and proceedings arising out of or

of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, for the
purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in
any Delaware state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of
the parties to this Agreement agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

          (b) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably consents to the
service of any summons and complaint and any other process in any other action
or proceeding relating to the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by
the personal delivery of copies of such process to such party to this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 8.8 shall affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

          Section 8.9. Specific Performance. The transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are unique. Accordingly, each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may
be entitled, each of the parties to this Agreement is entitled to a decree of
specific performance, provided that such party to this Agreement is not in
material default hereunder.

          Section 8.10. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any
of the parties to this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their
