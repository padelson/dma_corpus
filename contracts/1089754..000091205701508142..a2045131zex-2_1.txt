consummated by filing a certificate of merger as contemplated by the DGCL
(the "Certificate of Merger"), together with any required related
certificates, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of, the DGCL.  The Merger shall become effective at the time of such filing
or at such later time agreed to by NBC and the Company and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").  Prior to such filing, a
closing (the "Closing") shall be held at such time as may be agreed upon by
NBC and the Company, at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, 3330
Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA  94304, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction
or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VII.
The date of such closing is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

     SECTION 2.3.   Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time (i)
the Surviving Company shall possess all rights, privileges, powers and


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

franchises, both public and private, and all of the property, real, personal,
and mixed of each of the Company and Merger Sub and all obligations belonging
to or due to Merger Sub or the Company, all of which shall be vested in the
Surviving Company without any further act or deed; and (ii) the Surviving
Company shall be liable for all the obligations of Merger Sub and the Company.

     SECTION 2.4.   Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws  (a) Certificate of
Incorporation.  Unless otherwise determined by NBC prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and
restated so as to read in its entirety in the form set forth in Exhibit A and
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such Certificate of
Incorporation.

     (b)  By-laws.  The By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided in its Certificate of Incorporation and by the
DGCL.

     SECTION 2.5.   Directors and Officers.  The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Company, and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Company, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or until their earlier resignation, removal from
office or death.

     SECTION 2.6.  Effect on Securities.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of NBC, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any securities of the Company:

     (a)  Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common
stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share ("Merger Sub Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive the amount of the cash capital
contributed by the holder of such Merger Sub Common Stock upon issuance
thereof by Merger Sub.

     (b)  Conversion of Class A Common Stock of the Company.  Each share of
Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and such shares held by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company), shall be converted into the right
to receive $2.19 in cash (the "Consideration") from the Surviving Company.

     (c)  Conversion of Class B Common Stock of the Company.  Each share of
Class B Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than such shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), shall remain outstanding as of the Effective Time as validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B common stock, par
value $.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company, having all the same rights,
privileges and preferences as the Class B Common Stock.


                                      -7-

<PAGE>

     (d)  Cancellation.  Each share of Class A Common Stock or Class B common
stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor,
and cease to exist.

     SECTION 2.7.     Dissenting Shares.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Class A Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by a holder
who has the right to demand payment for and any appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor provision), who
perfects his demand for the appraisal of the fair value of his shares of
Class A Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL and, as of the Effective
Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to make such
demand (such shares of Class A Common Stock, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6(b), but the holder thereof shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by the DGCL.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) his right to make such demand, then as of the Effective Time or
the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, such dissenting
holder's shares of Class A Common Stock shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Consideration as provided in
Section 2.6(b) without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares.

     (c)  The Company shall give NBC (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of the fair value of any shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received
by the Company after the date hereof and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in and, after the Effective Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal or the payment of the fair cash value
of any such shares under the DGCL.  The Company shall not voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or the payment of the
fair cash value of any shares and shall not, except with the prior written
consent of NBC, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

     SECTION 2.8.   Treatment of Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
(a)  Not later than fifteen days (15) prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall send a notice (the "Option Notice") to all holders of options
to purchase shares of Common Stock (each, a "Company Option"): (i) specifying
that such options shall not be assumed in connection with the Merger, (ii)
specifying that the vesting restrictions applicable to all Company Options
outstanding at the time of such notice shall be eliminated such that no
vesting restrictions remain thereon, and (iii) specifying that any Company
Options outstanding as of the Effective Time shall terminate and be cancelled
at such time and represent only the right to receive the Option Consideration
as described in this Section 2.8(a).  The Company shall permit each holder of
a Company Option who desires to exercise all or any portion of such Company
Option following receipt of the Option Notice to exercise any portion of such
Company Option.  All Company Options outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time.


                                      -8-

<PAGE>

The holder of each Company Option so cancelled shall be entitled to receive
from the Company at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter
from the Company in consideration for such cancellation an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares subject to such Company
Option and (y) the excess of the Consideration over the exercise price per
share issuable upon exercise of such Company Option, adjusted for applicable
withholding taxes (the "Option Consideration"). NBC and the Company agree to
take all corporate or other action as shall be necessary to effectuate the
foregoing.

     (b)  Prior to the Effective Time, all rights to purchase shares of
Common Stock outstanding under the Company's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "Company ESPP") immediately prior to such date shall be exercised
and each share of Common Stock purchased pursuant to such exercise shall by
virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Consideration payable in
respect thereof, without the issuance of certificates representing issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock. Any Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Company ESPP shall be deemed issued and outstanding at the Effective Time.
The Company ESPP shall be terminated immediately following such exercises.
NBC and the Company agree to take all corporate or other action as shall be
necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

     SECTION 2.9.   Treatment of Warrants.  (a)  Each warrant to purchase
shares of Common Stock (each, a "Company Warrant") which has an exercise
price per share that is equal to or greater than the Consideration (the
"Underwater Warrants") shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without
consideration.  Each Company Warrant (other than an Underwater Warrant) shall
(A) become fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, to the
extent that it was not fully vested prior thereto, and (B) be cancelled by
the Company and the holder thereof shall receive at the Effective Time or as
soon as practicable thereafter from the Company in consideration for such
cancellation an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the number of
shares subject to such Company Warrant and (b) the excess of the
Consideration over the exercise price per share issuable upon exercise of
such Company Warrant, adjusted for applicable withholding taxes.  NBC and the
Company agree to take all corporate or other action as shall be necessary to
effectuate the foregoing, and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, if required, prior to the Closing Date, such
consent of each holder of a Company Warrant as shall be necessary to
effectuate the foregoing.

     (b)  As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
provide to the record holders of Company Warrants appropriate notice of such
holders' rights thereunder.

     SECTION 2.10.  Surrender of Shares of Common Stock.  (a)  Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall appoint a bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and NBC to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of the Consideration.

     (b)  The Surviving Company shall, at the Effective Time, provide the
Paying Agent with the full amount of the Consideration, in immediately
available funds.  The Paying Agent shall invest the Consideration as directed
by the NBC or the Surviving Company, as the


                                      -9-

<PAGE>

case may be, on a daily basis.  Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company.

     (c)  Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
instruct the Paying Agent to mail, no later than two Business Days after the
Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate representing shares
of Class A Common Stock converted upon the Merger pursuant to Section 2.6(b),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as NBC or the Surviving Company may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the certificates.  The Paying Agent shall accept such certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. Each holder of a certificate or certificates representing
shares of Class A Common Stock converted upon the Merger pursuant to Section
2.6(b) may thereafter surrender such certificate or certificates to the
Paying Agent, as agent for such holder, to effect the surrender of such
certificate or certificates on such holder's behalf for a period ending six
months after the Effective Time.  Upon the due surrender of certificates
representing shares of Class A Common Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Consideration, the Surviving Company shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay the holder of such certificates in exchange therefor the
applicable Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock represented by such certificate that have been so converted.  Until so
surrendered, each such certificate shall represent solely the right to
receive the applicable Consideration relating thereto.

     (d)  If payment of the Consideration in respect of converted shares of
Class A Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent that such tax
either has been paid or is not payable.

     (e)  At and after the Effective Time, no further transfer of shares of
Class A Common Stock which have been converted pursuant to this Agreement
into Consideration shall be made, other than transfers of shares of Class A
Common Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time.  In the event
that, after the Effective Time, certificates representing shares of Class A
Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to this Agreement into
Consideration are presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Consideration provided in Section 2.6.

     (f)  The Consideration paid in the Merger shall be net to the holder of
shares of Class A Common Stock without interest thereon, and shall be subject
to reduction only for any applicable United States federal or other back-up
withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by such holder.


                                      -10-

<PAGE>

     (g)  Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Company all cash,
certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
Transactions, and the Paying Agent's duties shall terminate.  Thereafter,
each holder of a certificate representing shares of Class A Common Stock may
surrender such certificate to the Surviving Company and (subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law) receive in
consideration therefor the aggregate Consideration relating thereto, without
any interest thereon.

     (h)  None of Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Class A Common Stock for any cash or
securities delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

     (i)  In the event the Surviving Company does not have adequate funds to
provide the full Consideration to the Paying Agent at the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 2.10(b) hereof, NBC agrees that immediately prior to the
Effective Time it shall prepay all or such portion of the promissory note,
dated November 30, 1999, in the original principal amount of $340,000,000
issued by NBC and held by Issuer, as is necessary to provide adequate
additional funds to enable the Company to provide such Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.10(b) hereof (after paying all fees and expenses of
the Company incurred in connection with this Agreement).  For the avoidance
of doubt, NBC will also continue to make all regularly scheduled payments of
principal and interest on such promissory note until the Effective Time. Any
and all Equity Interests in the Surviving Company outstanding after the
Effective Time, other than the Class B Common Stock held by NBC, shall be
cancelled.

     SECTION 2.11.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event any
certificates representing shares of Class A Common Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall deliver the Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Company may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver an indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent
with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

     SECTION 2.12.  Further Action.  If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to put the Surviving Company in possession of all
assets and property of every description and every interest, wherever
located, and the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority, of a public as well as of a private nature, of the Company and
Merger Sub, the Persons who were officers and directors of the Company and
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in
the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will
take, all such lawful and necessary action.

     SECTION 2.13.  Conversion of Promissory Note.  (a)  After satisfaction
of the conditions to closing set forth in Article VII hereof and immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (i) NBC will convert the Subordinated Zero
Coupon Convertible Debenture of the Company dated November 30, 1999 in the
principal amount of $39,477,953 held by NBC into shares of


                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Class B Common Stock and (ii) Investments Sub will convert the Subordinated
Zero Coupon Convertible Debenture of the Company dated November 30, 1999 in
the principal amount of $477,416,845 held by Investments Sub into shares of
Class B Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the optional conversion
provisions contained in Section 2(a) of each such debenture.  Investments Sub
will then transfer all Class B Common Stock held by it to NBC.

     (b)  Each of Investments Sub and NBC hereby agrees that Company's
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not constitute an Event of Default or otherwise be considered a breach of any
provisions of the Subordinated Zero Coupon Convertible Debenture held by it.

     SECTION 2.14.  Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution.  (a)  Immediately
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall make a final
liquidating distribution to NBC, as sole stockholder of the Surviving
Company, in exchange for all Class B Common Stock by transferring, assigning
and delivering to NBC all of the Surviving Company's right, title and
interest in and to all properties, assets and other rights owned or leased
by, or licensed to Surviving Company, but excluding the full amount of the
Consideration required to be provided by it to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.10(b) hereof (the "Distribution").  In consideration for the
Distribution, all Class B Common Stock shall be cancelled and NBC shall
simultaneously assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge when due, any
and all Liabilities (including Taxes) of the Surviving Company, but excluding
the obligation to provide the Consideration to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.10(b) hereof (the "Assumption").

     (b)  On the Closing Date, after the Effective Time, the Distribution and
the Assumption, the Surviving Company shall dissolve by filing a certificate
of dissolution as contemplated by the DGCL with respect to the Surviving
Company, together with any required related certificates, with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL.

     (c)  For all tax purposes, the Agreement shall constitute a plan of
liquidation pursuant to Section 331 of the Code and payment of the
Consideration shall constitute the initial liquidating distribution and the
Distribution shall constitute the final liquidating distribution of the
Surviving Company.

                                 ARTICLE III

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as set forth (a) in the written disclosure schedule dated as of
the date of this Agreement and previously delivered by the Company to NBC
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the
sections contained in this Agreement, and the disclosures in any section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify all of the representations in
the corresponding section of this Article III and, in addition, all other
sections in this Article III to the extent it is reasonably clear from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
sections), (b) in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.7(a))
filed prior


                                      -12-

<PAGE>

to the date hereof to the extent it is reasonably clear from a reading of the
disclosure in such Company SEC Reports that such disclosure is applicable to
the relevant representation and warranty contained herein or (c) in Contracts
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and NBC and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to NBC and Merger Sub as follows:

     SECTION 3.1.   Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.  Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority
necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted.  Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or entity
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company together with
the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each such Subsidiary and
the percentage of each class or type of each such Subsidiary's outstanding
Equity Interests owned by the Company or another Subsidiary of the Company.

     SECTION 3.2.   Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.  The Company
has heretofore made available to NBC a complete and correct copy of (a) its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as amended through the date hereof
(the "Company Charter Documents"), (b) the Certificates of Incorporation and
By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of, and any investor rights,
voting, co-sale or other similar agreements applicable to, each of its
Subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Documents") and (c) the Certificates of
Incorporation and By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) and any
investor rights, voting, co-sale or other agreements applicable to the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to each of its Minority Investments
(the "Minority Investment Documents").  Such Company Charter Documents and
Subsidiary Documents, and, to the Company's knowledge, the Minority
Investment Documents, are in full force and effect and no other charter or
organizational documents or investor rights, voting, co-sale or other similar
agreements are applicable to or binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Minority Investments.  Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the Company's knowledge, any Minority Investment is in violation of any
provision of its Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents.

     SECTION 3.3.   Capitalization.  (a)  The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, 100,000,000
shares of Class B Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$.0001 par value ("Preferred Stock").  As of March 31, 2001, (i) 39,019,243
shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive or similar rights, (ii) no shares of Common Stock were held by
Subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 10,286,317 shares of Class A Common Stock
were issuable upon the exercise of Company Options then outstanding, (iv)
8,682,582 shares of unissued Common Stock were reserved for issuance under

24,550,708


                                      -13-

<PAGE>

shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive or similar rights and (vii) no shares of Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding.  Between March 31, 2001 and the date of this
Agreement, the Company has not issued or reserved for issuance any Class A
Common Stock, Company Options or other Equity Interests of the Company,
except the issuance of Class A Common Stock as a result of the exercise of
Company Options outstanding at March 31, 2001.  Between December 31, 2000 and
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has declared or paid any dividend or distribution in respect of any of its
Equity Interests and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any Equity Interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Board of Directors has not
resolved to do any of the foregoing.

     (b)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any Minority
Investments in any Person that is not a Subsidiary.  All of the outstanding
Equity Interests of the Company's Subsidiaries and all of the Equity
Interests of the Minority Investments owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable, and all such shares are owned by the Company or another
Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
("Liens") or any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such Equity Interests) and
were issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities
Laws.

     (c)  Section 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
total outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants as of March 31, 2001
(other than all Underwater Warrants and all Company Options that have an
exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Consideration),
together with the aggregate exercise price therefor and the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1 or 3.11 or this Section 3.3, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the issued or unissued Equity Interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (d)  As of the date hereof, the only outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries is set forth in Section
3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 3.4.   Authority Relative to this Agreement.  The Company has
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Merger.   The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company other than the
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders in accordance with
the DGCL and the Company Charter Documents, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than the adoption of this
Agreement by the Company's stockholders in accordance with the DGCL,


                                      -14-

<PAGE>

including, to the extent applicable, Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section 203")
and the Company Charter Documents and the filing and recordation of the
appropriate documents with respect to the Merger in accordance with the
DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
NBC and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance, or other Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally, and to the extent that the availability of equitable remedies may
be limited by equitable principles.

SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the

hereof, any change in general economic conditions, any change affecting the
internet or media industry generally, any failure by the Company to meet

its accounting methods, principles or practices (other than changes required

     SECTION 3.9.   No Undisclosed Liabilities.  As of December 31, 2000,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries had any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, except liabilities (a) adequately provided for in
the Company's audited balance sheet (including any related notes thereto) as

they been known to the Company at the time of the preparation of the 2000
Balance Sheet, would not have been required under GAAP to be reflected on the
2000 Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto.  Since December 31,
2000, the Company and its Subsidiaries have only incurred liabilities (x) as
set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (y) in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (z) after
the date hereof pursuant to Section 5.2 and 5.3 hereof and which, in the case
of clause (y) of this Section 3.9, would not, individually or in the

actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or

Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the date of this Agreement the
suits, claims, actions, proceedings and investigations pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is
or are subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award having, or which would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.  To the Knowledge of the Company, as of
the date of this Agreement no officer of the Company or any Class A Director,
and no officer or director of the Company's Subsidiaries, has been served
with or otherwise has written notice of a written complaint naming such
officer or director as a defendant in any litigation commenced by
stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the
performance of his or her duties as an officer and/or director of the Company

Company has made available to NBC copies of each of its written Company
Employee Plans and a written summary of any unwritten Company Employee Plans.
"Company Employee Plan" shall mean any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other plan, policy, program, practice,

Affiliate, which are now, or were within the past six years, maintained by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or under which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has any obligation or liability, including all employment,
severance, retirement, incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, vacation,
holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability, fringe benefit, or stock-based
compensation plans, policies, programs, practices, agreements, perquisites,
understandings or arrangements. "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any entity

Company, is or was a member of (i) a controlled group of corporations within
the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code; (ii) a group of trades or
businesses under common control within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the

extent annual reports on Form 5500 are required with respect to any Company
Employee Plan, the most recent annual report and attached schedules for each
Company Employee Plan as to which such report is required to be filed, and
(iii) where applicable, the most recent notification or determination letter
and actuarial reports.

     (c)  Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate during the past six (6)
years has maintained, contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to or
maintain a Company Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (including,
without limitation, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or to Section 412 of the Code.  No Company Employee Plan is a
"multiple employer plan" as described in Section 3(40) of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code.  Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied.

     (d)  Each Company Employee Plan is and has been operated in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws.  The Company
has made all contributions required to be made by it up to and including the
date hereof with respect to each Company Employee Plan, except where failure
to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (e)  (i) Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable
determination letter as to its qualification or has remaining a period of
time under applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such a letter and make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Company
Employee Plan, and to the Knowledge of the Company nothing has occurred,
whether by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of such qualification; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their affiliation
with an ERISA Affiliate to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability
imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws; (iii) to the Company's
Knowledge, no "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in ERISA

or not waived)) has occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan; and
(iv) no Company Employee Plan provides retiree welfare benefits and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any
retiree welfare benefits other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code;
and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or is a
successor or parent corporation to any entity that has engaged in, a
transaction described in Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA that would, in the
case of each of clauses (ii) or (iv), individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (f)  With respect to any Company Employee Plan, no actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no facts or
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such actions, suits or claims.

     (g)  Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of this Agreement, no Company
Employee Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any
other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the consummation of the Transactions
or as a result of the termination of employment of any such employee within a
specified period of time after such consummation.

Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the "Company IP"), in the fashion such Intellectual
Property has been used in the business of Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing, except where the failure to own or be licensed or otherwise
have such rights in any such Company IP, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

     (b)  to Company's Knowledge, the Company IP that is owned in whole or in
substantial part by Company and/or its Subsidiaries ("Company-Owned IP") is
enforceable and unexpired, has not been abandoned and is free of all liens,
except to the extent such unenforceablity, expiration or abandonment would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

     (c)  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice with respect to any alleged infringement or unlawful use by
the Company or its Subsidiaries of any Intellectual Property right owned or
alleged to be owned by any Third Party that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and to the Company's Knowledge, the use of the Company IP in the business of


                                      -22-

     (e)  the Company has taken reasonable steps to protect and maintain the
rights in the Company-Owned IP; and

     (f)  no government action is outstanding or pending, or to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened, that seeks to limit or challenge the validity,
enforceability, ownership or use of any Company IP, in either case in a
fashion that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

For purposes of this Section 3.18, "Company IP" will exclude any and all
Intellectual Property licensed or otherwise provided to Company or its
Subsidiaries by NBC or its Affiliates (other than Company and its
Subsidiaries), including without limitation any Intellectual Property
provided or licensed under that certain Brand Integration and License

during the Interim Period.  The Company agrees to use reasonable


                                      -29-

<PAGE>

commercial efforts to terminate and pay, discharge or satisfy during the
Interim Period the arrangements and liabilities set forth in the reduction
plan, and any other arrangements and liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably required by NBC.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
provision of this Section 5.2 shall require the Company to take any action
that the Class A Directors determine in good faith by majority vote would
have a material adverse effect on the Company in the event the Agreement were
terminated prior to the Effective Time.  The Company agrees to obtain NBC's
written consent prior to making any material commitments or incurring any
material liability or other obligation in connection with such reduction
other than as set forth in any reduction plan mutually agreed upon by the
Company and NBC.  In particular, the Company agrees it shall obtain the prior
written consent of NBC to any termination, discharge or satisfaction
involving payment by the Company exceeding $25,000 for any individual
obligation.  In addition, the Company agrees to continue to purchase and
broadcast advertising pursuant to the advertising agreement between the
Company and NBC dated as of November 30, 1999, consistent with the level of
such purchases provided in the Company budget as of the date hereof.

     SECTION 5.3.   Additional Agreements with Respect to Employees. The
Company agrees that during the Interim Period, it will terminate its
employment of the numbers of employees set forth in Section 5.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule by the corresponding dates set forth therein. NBC
and the Company agree to review such termination schedule in good faith on an
ongoing basis during the Interim Period, and may modify such schedule as
necessary to enable the Company to comply with Section 5.2 and the other
provisions hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this
Section 5.3 shall require the Company to take any action that the Class A
Directors determine in good faith by majority vote would, as a result of
developments after the date of this Agreement, have a material adverse effect
on the Company in the event the Agreement were terminated prior to the
Effective Time.  NBC acknowledges that in performing its obligations under
this Section 5.3 in accordance herewith, the Company may not be able to
comply with the notice requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 and the Company may be required to provide
compensation in lieu thereof to certain terminated employees.

     SECTION 5.4.   No Solicitation.  (a)  The Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative, advisor,
Subsidiary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) solicit or
initiate any inquiries, proposals or offers (whether or not in writing) from
any Third Party regarding an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing
inquiries, proposals or offers being referred to herein as an "Acquisition
Proposal") or provide any non-public information in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal or any of the foregoing, or (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any of the
foregoing.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from (A) furnishing information to a Third Party
which has made an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this
Agreement that the Board of Directors or a majority of the Class A Directors
has concluded constitutes or could result in a Superior Proposal, or (B)
subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.4, entering into
or participating in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal not solicited in violation of this Agreement that the Board of
Directors or a majority of the Class A Directors has concluded constitutes or
could result in a Superior Proposal.

     (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any of
the transactions described in the definition of Alternative Transaction (with
all of the percentages included in the definition of such term raised to 50%
for purposes of this definition) with respect to which the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), (i) is reasonably
capable of being completed and (ii) represents a superior transaction for the
holders of Class A Common Stock to the Transactions.

     (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, an "Alternative Transaction" means
any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which a Third Party acquires or would
acquire more than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares of any
class of Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or
otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
substantially all assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)

Interests of Subsidiaries of the Company and securities of the entity
surviving any merger or business combination involving any of the Company's
Subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries having a fair market
value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith)
equal to more than fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of, on a
consolidated basis, the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other transaction the
consummation of which would or could reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay either of the Transactions or
which would or could reasonably be expected to materially dilute the benefits
to NBC of the Transactions.

     (d)  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof nor the Class A
Directors shall withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to NBC, the
recommendation by the Board of Directors of the adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the
Board of Directors or the Class A Directors may withdraw or modify in any
manner adverse to NBC their recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company if they determine in good faith, based on
the advice of their outside legal advisors, that such action is required to
comply with their fiduciary duties under the DGCL, and (y) in the event that
the Board of Directors receives an Acquisition Proposal and the Class A
Directors or the Board of Directors determine in good faith, after
consultation with their financial and legal advisors, that failure to do so
is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under the
DGCL, the Class A Directors and the Board of Directors may (i) withdraw or
modify in any manner adverse to NBC their recommendation of the adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company and (ii) subject to this
Section 5.4(e) and Section 8.1(f), terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) (and concurrently with or after such termination, if it so
chooses, the Board of Directors may cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (an "Acquisition Agreement")), but only after the third
Business Day following NBC's receipt of written notice advising NBC that the
Board of Directors or the Class A Directors are prepared to accept a Superior
Proposal, and attaching the most current version of any such Superior
Proposal or any draft of an Acquisition Agreement.

     (e)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position, and making related
filings with the SEC, as required by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure to do so is reasonably likely to cause the Board of
Directors to be in breach of its obligations under any applicable law, rule
or regulation.

practicable for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Transactions and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable.  Subject to Section 5.4(d), the Company, through its Board of
Directors, will, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the Transactions as set forth in Section 3.23(a) and
shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions and shall take such other reasonable actions
that are necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders
in favor of such adoption and approval.  Subject to Section 5.4(d) hereof,
any such recommendation, together with a copy of the opinion referred to in
Section  3.22 shall be included in the Proxy Statement.

     (b)  NBC hereby agrees to vote or consent (or cause to be voted or
consented), in person or by proxy, at the Company Stockholders Meeting, all
Class B Stock and any other voting securities of the Company (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned or held of
record by NBC or as to which NBC has, directly or indirectly, the right to
vote or direct the voting as of the relevant record date, in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions.

     SECTION 6.3.   Access to Information; Confidentiality.  Upon reasonable
notice and subject to restrictions contained in confidentiality agreements to
which the Company is subject (from which it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to be released), the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) (i) during the period after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of NBC reasonable access to
its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and (ii) during
such period, furnish promptly to NBC all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as NBC may reasonably request, and shall make
available to NBC for reasonable periods of time the appropriate individuals
(including attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of
the Company's business, properties and personnel as NBC may reasonably
request.  NBC shall keep such information confidential in accordance with,
and agrees to be bound by, the terms of the confidentiality letter, dated
March 26, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Letter") between NBC and the Company.
No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect any
representations or warranties of the parties herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 6.4.   Consents; Approvals.  Each of the Company and NBC shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders (including all consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations and orders from all Governmental Authorities or
other Third Parties); provided that without the prior written consent of NBC,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall pay any cash or other
consideration, make any commitments or incur any liability or other
obligation to obtain any such consent.  The Company and NBC shall make all
filings (including all filings with any Governmental Authority) required in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and NBC and the consummation by them of the Transactions.  The
Company and NBC shall furnish all information required to be included in the
Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental


                                     -33-

<PAGE>

Authority in connection with the Transactions.  Each of the Company and NBC
shall make an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within ten days after the
date hereof and shall promptly supply any additional information that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act.  The Company and NBC shall each use
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.  In addition, the Company and NBC shall each
promptly make any other filing that may be required under any other antitrust
law or by any antitrust authority or any takeover laws of jurisdictions
outside of the United States.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no party hereto nor any of their Affiliates shall be
required to make any disposition or any agreement to hold separate, any
Subsidiary, asset or business, and the Company shall not agree to do so.

     SECTION 6.5.   Indemnification and Insurance.  (a)  NBC and the
Surviving Company, jointly and severally, agree, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving Company's Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and
former (x) director, (y) officer or (z) solely to the extent a party to an
Indemnification Agreement, employee, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and their respective estates, heirs, personal representatives
successors and assigns (each, an "Indemnified Party", and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel) as incurred, judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, (collectively, an "Action") (x) arising out
of or pertaining to the Transactions, or (y) otherwise with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case
to the same extent as provided in the Company's amended and restated
Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws or indemnification contracts with any
such Indemnified Parties (to the extent such contracts have been disclosed to
NBC and are identified in Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
(collectively, the "Indemnification Agreements"), as in effect on the date
hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the date hereof,
provided that any such indemnification of an employee hereunder pursuant to
clause (z) of this Section 6.5(a) shall be limited to that provided in the
Indemnification Agreement to which such employee is a party.  In the event of
any such Action, (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) and
subject to the specific terms of any indemnification contract, (i) any
counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the
Effective Time shall be reasonably satisfactory to NBC, (ii) after the
Effective Time, NBC shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received, and (iii) the
Surviving Company and NBC will cooperate in the defense of any such Action;
provided, however, that in the event any claim or claims for indemnification
are made within such six year period, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of
any and all such claims; provided, further, that: (A) promptly after receipt
by an Indemnified Party of notice of any such Action, the Indemnified Party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Surviving
Company notify the Surviving Company in writing of this claim or the
commencement of that Action (although the failure to provide such notice will
not adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder except to
the extent NBC is prejudiced by such failure); (B) the Surviving Company
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Action, and, to
the extent it wishes, assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be; (C) the Surviving Company shall not, in connection


                                     -34-

<PAGE>

with any one such Action or separate but substantially similar or related
Actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations
or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such Indemnified Parties;
(D) no Indemnified Party may settle any such Action, without the prior
written consent of the Surviving Company; and (E) the Surviving Company shall
not settle any such Action, unless the Indemnified Party that is subject of
such action is fully released as a result thereof.

     (b)  In addition, the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect for six
years from the Effective Time policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous
than any such policies maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time
(the "D&O Insurance"), with respect to matters occurring up to and including
the Effective Time and having the maximum available coverage under any such
D&O Insurance policies; provided that (i) the Surviving Company following the
Merger shall not be required to spend in excess of 200% of the annual
aggregate premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
provided, further, that if the Surviving Company following the Merger would
be required to spend in excess of such amount per year to obtain insurance
having the maximum available coverage under the D&O Insurance policies, the
Surviving Company will be required to spend up to such amount to maintain or
procure the maximum amount of such (or similar) coverage that is available at
that cost and (ii) such policies may in the sole discretion of the Surviving
Company be one or more "tail" policies for all or any portion of the full six
year period.

     (c)  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

     (d)  This Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions, is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the officers
and directors of the Company, shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of NBC and the Surviving Company and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties.

     SECTION 6.6.   Notification of Certain Matters.  The Company shall give
prompt notice to NBC, and NBC shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which could reasonably be expected to cause the failure to satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, respectively, and (ii)
any notice or other communication from any Third Party or Governmental
Authority alleging that the consent of such Third Party or Governmental
Authority is or may be required in connection with the Transactions;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.6 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party giving or receiving such notice unless the failure to give such
notice results in prejudice to the other party.

     SECTION 6.7.   Further Action.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to


                                     -35-

<PAGE>

take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
as promptly as practicable the Transactions, to obtain in a timely manner all
necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied
all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.8.   Public Announcements.  NBC and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any written public
statement with respect to either the Transactions or this Agreement and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without
the prior consent of the other parties, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the Nasdaq
National Market or the New York Stock Exchange.

     SECTION 6.9.   Conveyance Taxes.  NBC and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any
similar taxes which become payable in connection with the Transactions that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.

     SECTION 6.10.  Employee Plans and Benefits.  The Company agrees to
terminate the NBC Internet, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k)
Plan") prior to the occurrence of the Transactions, including the Merger, and
distribute the assets of the 401(k) Plan in accordance with the provisions of
the 401(k) Plan, the Code and ERISA.

     SECTION 6.11.  Disposition of Litigation.  Subject to Section 5.4, the
Company will consult with NBC with respect to any Action by any Third Party
to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Transactions, and will resist
any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Transactions.
NBC may participate in (but not control) the defense of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the Transactions
at NBC's sole cost and expense.  In addition, neither the Company nor NBC
will voluntarily cooperate with any Third Party that has sought or may
hereafter seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Transactions,
and NBC and the Company will cooperate to resist any such effort to restrain
or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Transactions.

                               ARTICLE VII

                        CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

have been adopted and the Merger and the other Transactions shall have been

the parties hereto shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to have any
such judgment, decree or order or other legal restraint vacated.

     SECTION 7.2.   Additional Conditions to Obligations of NBC.  The
obligations of NBC and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are also subject to

Section 3.3, 3.14, 3.21, 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24, which shall be true and correct

effect signed on behalf of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer or
Chief Financial Officer; and

     (b)  Agreements and Covenants.  The Company shall have performed or

effect as if made on and as of the Effective Time, except for those
representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular

this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date;

     (c)  by either NBC or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction
or Governmental Authority shall have issued a nonappealable final order,
decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action having the

Transactions;

     (d)  by either NBC or the Company if the Requisite Stockholder Approvals

<PAGE>

rejection thereof; (y) take any position or make any disclosures to the

Superior Proposal; and provided further that any such termination will not be
effective unless the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3 shall have been
paid concurrently with or prior to such termination; or

     (g)  (i) by the Company, if NBC breaches any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement the result of
which breach is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect NBC's
ability to consummate the Transactions and, with respect to any such breach
that is reasonably capable of being remedied, the breach is not remedied
within 30 days after the Company has furnished NBC with written notice of
such breach or (ii) by NBC, if the Company breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which is reasonably likely to result in a failure of the conditions
in Section 7.2 to be satisfied and, with respect to any such breach that is
reasonably capable of being remedied, the breach is not remedied within 30
days after NBC has furnished the Company with written notice of such breach.

     SECTION 8.2.   Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders,
except that (i) the Company or NBC may have liability as set forth in Section
8.3, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve the Company or NBC from liability
for any willful breach of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.3.   Expenses; Termination Fee.  (a)  In the event that this
Agreement is terminated by NBC pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the Company shall pay to NBC by wire transfer of

to $3 million (the "Termination Fee").  Such payment shall be made (i) prior
to or concurrently with any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and (ii)
on the next Business Day following termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e).

     (b)  If all of the following events have occurred:

       (i)  an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed, publicly proposed
     or otherwise publicly communicated at any time on or after the date of
     this Agreement and has not been irrevocably and unconditionally publicly
     withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement and thereafter this
     Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) due to the failure to
     obtain the approval described in clause (i) of the definition of
     "Requisite Stockholder Approvals"; and

       (ii) thereafter, within nine (9) months of the date of such termination,
     the Company, (A) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
     Alternative


                                     -39-

<PAGE>

    Transaction (and such Alternative Transaction or any amended
    or modified version thereof is subsequently consummated) or (B) the
    Company otherwise consummates any Alternative Transaction;

then, on the day that such Alternative Transaction is consummated the Company
shall pay to NBC by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by NBC an amount equal to the Termination Fee. For
purposes of this Section 8.3(b) all references to "15%" in the definition of
"Alternative Transaction" shall be deemed references to "50%."

     (c)  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall
bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

     SECTION 8.4.  Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment may be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval.  This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, NBC shall have the right, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other Person, to waive performance
or amend the provisions of (i) Section 2.13(a) hereof with respect to those
transactions taking place solely between NBC and Investments Sub and (ii)
Section 2.14 hereof with respect to any and all transactions taking place
between NBC and the Surviving Company after the Effective Time.

     SECTION 8.5.  Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may with respect to any other party hereto (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of such party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
subject to the proviso contained in Section 8.4, waive compliance of such
party with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.  No such
extension or waiver shall be deemed or construed as a continuing extension or
waiver on any occasion other than the one on which such extension or waiver
was granted or as an extension or waiver with respect to any provision of
this Agreement not expressly identified in such extension or waiver on the
same or any other occasion.

                                  ARTICLE IX

agreements set forth in Article II, Section 6.5, Article VIII and Article IX
and any other covenant or agreement in this Agreement which contemplates
performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.

word "including" shall mean "including without limitation," whether or not
expressed, (d) any reference to a statute shall mean the statute and any
regulations thereunder in force as of the date of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, as applicable, unless otherwise expressly provided, (e) any
reference herein to a Section, Article, Paragraph, Schedule or Exhibit refers
to a Section, Article or Paragraph of or a Schedule or Exhibit to this
Agreement, unless otherwise stated, (f) when calculating the period of time
within or following which any act is to be done or steps taken, the date
which is the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and
if the last day of such period is not a Business Day, then the period shall
end on the next day which is a Business Day, and (g) any reference to any of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall include such company's
predecessor or predecessors, as the case may be.

     SECTION 9.4.   Severability.  If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party.  Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

     SECTION 9.5.   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Letter constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matters hereof and thereof, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or therein.

     SECTION 9.6.   Assignment.  This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise, except that (a) all or any of the rights of
Merger Sub hereunder may be assigned to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of NBC; provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder and (b) all or any of the rights and
obligations of the Surviving Company can be assigned pursuant to Section 2.14
hereof as part of the Distribution and Assumption.

     SECTION 9.7.   Parties in Interest.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, including, without limitation, by way of
subrogation, other than pursuant to Section 6.5 (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and may be enforced by such
Indemnified Parties).

     SECTION 9.8.   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.  All rights
and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

     (b)  Each of the parties hereto submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the United States located in
Delaware with respect to any claim or cause of action arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.  Each of the parties agrees not contest such
venue as an inappropriate venue or forum or assert a claim of forum non
conveniens as a basis to move such claim or cause of action to another venue
or forum.

suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be effective against
any party hereto if given personally or by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested or by any other means of mail that requires a signed
receipt, postage prepaid, mailed to such party as provided in Section 9.2, or
by personal service with a copy of such process mailed to such party being
served by first class mail, or registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit
the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

     SECTION 9.10.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

     SECTION 9.11.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH OF NBC, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM

TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

     SECTION 9.12.  Obligations of Merger Sub.  Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Company or the
Surviving Company to take action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of NBC to cause such person to take such action.
