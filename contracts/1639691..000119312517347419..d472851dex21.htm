acted as legal counsel to one or more members of the Seller Group prior to the Initial Closing, and that Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP intends to act as legal counsel to one or more members of the Seller Group (which will no longer include the

adverse to Purchaser or any Transferred Subsidiary and even though Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP may have represented a Transferred Subsidiary in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Purchaser represents that Purchaser&#146;s own attorney
has explained and helped Purchaser evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the right to assert future conflict against Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP, and Purchaser&#146;s consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed. In addition, all

contemplated hereby (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all of the client files and records in the possession of Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) shall be deemed to be

shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b)&nbsp;to the extent that files of Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP in respect of such

such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Transferred Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP and any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise. In addition, Purchaser and
the Transferred Subsidiaries agree that it would be impractical to remove all attorney-client communications from the records (including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mails</FONT> and other electronic files) of the Transferred Subsidiaries.
Accordingly, as to any such communications prior to the Initial Closing, Purchaser and each Transferred Subsidiary together with any of their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that no such person may use or
