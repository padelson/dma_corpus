Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter confirms the intention of LivaNova PLC (" _Seller_ "), MicroPort
Scientific Corporation (" _Guarantor_ ", solely for the provisions set forth
in Section 8) and MicroPort Cardiac Rhythm B.V. (" _Buyer_ " and,
together with Seller and Guarantor, collectively, the " _Parties_ " and each
of them, individually, a " _Party_ ") to enter into a Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement, the form of which is attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), providing for the acquisition of the Business (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement) by Buyer upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein (the " _Proposed Transaction_ "). Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined in this letter have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement.

In consideration of and as an inducement to each Partys agreement to expend
further time, effort and resources in connection with continuing efforts to
effect the Proposed Transaction, the Parties hereby further agree as follows:

 

1. _Consultations with Staff Representative Bodies_. 

 

(a) _Initiation of Consultations_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the execution and delivery by the Parties of this letter (and in
any event no later than five days after the date of this letter), Seller will
commence (or will cause its applicable controlled affiliates to commence) such
consultations with the works councils and other employee representative
bodies set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Staff Representative Bodies_ ")
required by applicable Law in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

 



1 (b) _Cooperation_. Buyer will (i) reasonably cooperate with Seller in
connection with the information and consultation process with any Staff
Representative Body and (ii) in furtherance of the foregoing, promptly furnish
to Seller such information as may be reasonably requested by Seller in
connection with such consultations or the preparation of any filing or
submission to the Staff Representative Bodies required in connection
therewith, including answering reasonable questions from any Staff
Representative Body or any expert appointed thereby. Seller shall (x) permit
Buyer to participate in any meetings with the Staff Representative Bodies and
(y) keep Buyer regularly informed of the status of the information and
consultation process with each Staff Representative Body (including promptly
providing Buyer with copies of any correspondence or other documentation
received by Seller from the Staff Representative Bodies). Seller shall (A)
permit Buyer to review in advance any written correspondence, notices
or communications (including any supporting materials) to be delivered or
made by Seller to the Staff Representative Bodies, (B) consult with Buyer in
connection with any such written correspondence, notices or communications and
give Buyer a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, and take into account
in good faith any comments that Buyer may make with respect thereto, (C) use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with Buyer in connection with any oral
communications to be had between Seller and the Staff Representative Bodies
and taken into account in good faith any feedback from Buyer when engaging
into such oral communications, and (D) use its reasonable best efforts to
complete the information and consultation process with each Staff
Representative Body as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof.

 

2. _Execution of Purchase Agreement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than ten (10) days, following the earlier of (a) the issuance of the last to be issued of the final written opinions of the Staff Representative Bodies in France in accordance with applicable Law in connection with the Proposed Transaction (each, a " _Final Opinion_ ") and (b) the date when the Staff Representative Bodies in France are deemed to have rendered an opinion following the expiration of the period provided under article R. 2323-1-1 of the French _Code du Travail_ (or the expiration of such longer period as may be ordered by the competent court in accordance with the last paragraph of article L. 2323-4 of the French _Code du Travail_ ), each Party will execute and deliver (or will cause its applicable controlled affiliates to execute and deliver) the Purchase Agreement and such other definitive agreements and other instruments as are contemplated by the Purchase Agreement to be executed and delivered concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this letter, the Parties will give due consideration to any recommendations made by the Staff Representative Bodies in any Final Opinion and will consider such changes to the Purchase Agreement as the Parties may mutually agree to reflect such recommendations. 

3. _Exclusivity_. Seller agrees that, during the term of this letter, Seller will negotiate exclusively with Buyer with respect to the Proposed Transaction and will not, and will cause its controlled affiliates and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information regarding the Business, whether through continued access to any electronic data room or otherwise) any inquiries or proposals from any third 

 



2  parties concerning the sale of the Business or any material portion of the
Business (excluding sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business)
(whether by way of merger, transfer, lease or license of capital stock or
assets, or otherwise) (a " _Competing Transaction_ "), (ii) hold any
discussions or enter into any agreements with, or provide any non-public
information (whether through continued access to any electronic data room or
otherwise) or respond to, any third party in connection with a proposed
Competing Transaction or (iii) cooperate in any way with, assist, participate
in, solicit or facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort or attempt by any
third party to do or seek any of the foregoing. If approached by a third party
concerning a Competing Transaction during the term of this letter, Seller
shall promptly inform Buyer regarding such contact and furnish Buyer with a
copy of any inquiry or proposal (or, if not in writing, a description
thereof), including the name of such third party, and keep Buyer promptly
informed of the status and details of any future notices, requests,
correspondence or communications related thereto. For the avoidance of doubt,
a "Competing Transaction" shall not include any transaction involving a change
of control of Seller (regardless of the form of such transaction, through
merger, acquisition of stock or otherwise).

4. _Incorporation of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. 

 

(a) Article III of the Purchase Agreement (including the preamble thereto)
is hereby incorporated by reference into this letter as if such
representations and warranties are fully set forth herein. Article IV of the
Purchase Agreement (including the preamble thereto) is hereby incorporated by
reference into this letter as if such representations and warranties
are fully set forth herein. Prior to execution of this letter, Seller has
delivered to Buyer the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) The covenants set forth in Sections 5.01 (Conduct of Business), 5.02
(Restructuring), 5.03 (Access to Information), 5.04 (Publicity), 5.05
(Confidentiality), 5.06 (Notice of Certain Events), 5.07 (Efforts; Regulatory

Letters) and 5.22 (Sale Non-Disclosure Agreements) of the Purchase Agreement
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the Parties during the term of this letter
as if such covenants were fully set forth herein.

5. _Termination_. 

 

(a) _Termination Rights_. This letter may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this letter abandoned at any time:

(i) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(ii) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Purchase Agreement is not executed
and delivered by the Parties on or prior to November 10, 2018 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that (A) the right to terminate this
letter under this clause shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
perform any of its 

 



3  obligations under this letter has been a substantial cause of the failure of
the Purchase Agreement to be executed and delivered on or prior to the
Termination Date and (B) neither Party shall have the right to terminate this
letter pursuant to this clause during the pendency of any Proceeding brought
by the other Party prior to the Termination Date for specific performance of
this letter;

 

(iii) by Buyer, if (A) (1) Seller shall have materially breached any of its
covenants contained in this letter or (2) any of the representations or
warranties of Seller contained herein fails to be true and correct such that
the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) of the Purchase Agreement is not
capable of being satisfied and (B) such breach or inaccuracy cannot be cured
by Seller by the Termination Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured by the earlier of (1) the thirtieth day following receipt by
Seller of written notice of such breach or inaccuracy from Buyer stating
Buyers intention to terminate this letter pursuant to this clause and the
basis for such termination and (2) the Termination Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this letter
pursuant to this clause if Buyer is then in material breach of this letter;

 

(iv) by Seller, if (A) (1) Buyer shall have materially breached any of its
covenants contained in this letter or (2) any of the representations or
warranties of Buyer contained herein fails to be true and correct such that
the condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) of the Purchase Agreement is not
capable of being satisfied and (B) such breach or inaccuracy cannot be cured
by Buyer by the Termination Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured by the earlier of (1) the thirtieth day following receipt by Buyer
of written notice of such breach or inaccuracy from Seller stating Sellers
intention to terminate this letter pursuant to this clause and the basis for
such termination and (2) the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall not have the right to terminate this letter pursuant to this
clause if Seller is then in material breach of this letter;

 

(v) by either Seller or Buyer, if a Governmental Entity shall have issued
any Order or taken any other action, in each case, which has become final and
non-appealable and which restrains, permanently enjoins or otherwise prohibits
the Proposed Transaction; _provided_ , that this right of termination
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with its
obligations under this letter has been the primary cause of or resulted in
such Order.

 

(b) _Automatic Termination_. This letter shall terminate automatically
upon the valid, binding and enforceable execution and delivery of the
Purchase Agreement by the Parties.

(c) _Effect of Termination_.

 

(i) In the event of termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Section
5(a), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made.
Upon the termination of this letter pursuant to this Section 5, this letter
shall forthwith 

 



4  become null and void and of no further force and effect (other than the
provisions of Section 5(d) and Section 7, which shall survive termination of
this letter), and there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Seller
or their respective affiliates or Representatives; _provided_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any Party for liability or damages resulting from
willful and material breach of this letter).

 

(ii) If this letter is terminated by Seller or Buyer as provided in Section
5(a), then Section 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement relating to the return
or destruction of confidential information shall apply.

 

(d) _Termination Fee_. In the event that this letter is terminated
pursuant to Section 5(a)(iii) (in the case such breaching Party is Seller) or
Section 5(a)(iv) (in the case such breaching Party is Buyer) because a Party
fails to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement within the time period
specified in Section 2 in material breach of such Partys obligations under
this letter, then the breaching Party shall pay to the other Party an amount
in the aggregate equal to $6,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), which shall
be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3)
Business Days following receipt of written payment instructions from the other
Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount described in this Section 5(d)
shall not be payable by either Party, and neither Party shall otherwise be
deemed to be in breach of its obligations under this letter, in the event of a
Partys failure to implement any recommendation made by any Staff
Representative Body in any Final Opinion. Subject to the rights of
the Parties to seek specific performance or other equitable relief in
accordance with Section 7(m), a Partys right to receive the Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 5(d) shall be its sole and exclusive remedy under
the circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable under this letter, and
such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates) shall be deemed
to have waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) with respect
to, (i) any failure of the transactions contemplated by this letter to be
consummated and (ii) any other breach by any other Party of its obligations
under this letter. Upon payment by a Party of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 5(d) under the circumstances where the Termination Fee is
payable under this letter, neither such Party nor any of its affiliates shall
have any further liability or obligation (under this letter, the Purchase
Agreement or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this letter, the
Purchase Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and in no event shall any Party (and such Party shall ensure such Partys
controlled affiliates do not) seek to recover any money damages or losses, or
seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy (including any
equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection with this letter, the Purchase
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Parties agree that the Termination Fee and the agreements contained in this
Section 5(d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
letter and the Purchase Agreement and that the Termination Fee constitutes
liquidated damages and not a penalty.

6. _Confidentiality_. This letter and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

 



5 7. _Miscellaneous_. 

 

(a) _Assignment_. Neither this letter nor any of the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder may be assigned by Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, without the prior written consent of
Seller (in the case of an assignment by Buyer) or Buyer (in the case of an
assignment by Seller), as applicable; _provided_ that (a) Seller may assign
any rights and obligations hereunder to any of its affiliates and (b) Buyer
may assign any of its rights hereunder to any of its controlled affiliates, in
each case, without the consent of any other person, but provided (in the case
of clause (a) or (b)) that no such assignment shall release the applicable
assignor from any liability or obligation under this letter in the event its
obligations are not performed. Subject to the first sentence of this Section
7(a), this letter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted
assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 7(a) shall be null and
void. 

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This letter is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any person,
other than the Parties and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
rights hereunder.

 

(c) _Expenses_. Each Party shall pay its own legal, accounting and other
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery of this letter and all documents and instruments executed pursuant
hereto and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other costs and expenses incurred by such Party, except as otherwise
expressly set forth herein or in the Purchase Agreement.

(d) _Notice_. All notices, requests, permissions, waivers and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given (a) five (5) Business Days following sending by registered or

or to such other address(es) as shall be furnished in writing by any such
Party to the other Party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 7(d).

(e) _Counterparts_. This letter may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when each Party shall have received counterparts hereof
signed by the other Party. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg or similar
attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic_

 



7   _Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any Party, each Party shall re-execute the original form of
this letter and deliver such form to the other Party. No Party shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

(f) _Entire Agreement_. This letter (including the Exhibits hereto),
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof, and supersede all other understandings and negotiations with
respect thereto.

(g) _Severability_. In the event that any provision contained in this
letter shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective as to such jurisdiction
to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
letter is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this letter shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this letter so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

(h) _Governing Law_. This letter, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this letter and any disputes arising under or related hereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without reference to principles or rules of conflicts of Laws, to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of
another jurisdiction.

 

(i) _Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding
against them arising out of or in connection with this letter or the
transactions contemplated by this letter or disputes relating hereto (whether
for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be brought
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the state courts of
New York located in New York County, and hereby irrevocably accepts and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts __in__
  _ _personam__ with respect to any such Proceeding and waives to the fullest
extent permitted by Law any objection that it may now or hereafter have that
any such Proceeding has been brought in 

 



8  an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any final judgment in
any suit, action or other Proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

(j) _Service of Process_. Each of the Parties consents to service of any
process, summons, notice or document that may be served in any Proceeding in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or the
state courts of New York located in New York County in any manner permitted by
applicable Law and agrees that service of process on such Party as provided
for notices in Section 7.01(d) (other than by fax or email) to such Partys
respective address set forth in Section 7.01(d) is reasonably calculated to
give actual notice and shall be deemed effective service of process on such
Person.

(k) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS LETTER OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO OR
THERETO. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS LETTER BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION.

 

(l) _Amendments and Waivers_. This letter may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of
the Party waiving compliance. No course of dealing between the Parties shall
be effective to amend or waive any provision of this letter. No failure or
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
applicable Law.

 

(m) _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this letter in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this letter and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction without proof of damages or inadequacy of legal remedy
and without the posting or provision of any bond or other security, this being
in addition to

 



9  any other remedy to which they are entitled under this letter and (b) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this letter and, without that right, neither Seller nor Buyer
would have entered into this letter. The Parties agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law.

 

(n) _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified, all references to currency,
monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.)
dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in United States dollars.

 

8. _Guarantor_. 

 

(a) Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the timely
performance and observance by Buyer of all its obligations to be performed or
observed under this letter, including (a) all of Buyers payment obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, which include payment of the Termination Fee, if
applicable; and (b) any money damages required to be paid by Buyer arising
from any breach by Buyer of its pre-Initial Closing obligations under this
letter or the Purchase Agreement (such obligations, the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ ").

 

(b) This guarantee is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty by Guarantor of
all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full
force and effect until the earlier of (i) all Guaranteed Obligations having
been indefeasibly performed in full and paid in cash and (ii) the Initial
Closing. Guarantor hereby waives presentment, protest, notice, dishonor or
default, demand for payment and any other notices to which Guarantor might
otherwise be entitled.

 

(c) Guarantor hereby agrees that Buyer may, at any time and from time to
time, and without notice to the Guarantor, make any agreement with the Seller
Group for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or for any modification or amendment of the terms
thereof, all without in any way impairing, releasing, discharging or
otherwise affecting the obligations of Guarantor (provided, for the avoidance
of doubt, that the obligations of the Guarantor shall not be increased by such
agreement). Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any
disability or other defense of Buyer (other than defense of payment or
performance), or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of
Buyer, or any claim that Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome
than Buyers (in the case of any of the foregoing, other than a defense
available to Buyer under the terms hereof or the Purchase Agreement (to the
extent incorporated by reference herein)) and waives the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting the liability of Guarantor hereunder. The
obligations of Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not
merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(not including the Transferred Subsidiaries) and, to the extent held by a
Transferred Subsidiary, transferred out of such Transferred Subsidiary and

4 Section 1.04 _Consents to Certain Assignments_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer, assign or
deliver, directly or indirectly, any Transferred Contract or Permit, or any
benefit arising thereunder, if an attempted direct or indirect sale, transfer,
assignment or delivery thereof, without the consent of a third party
(including a Governmental Entity), would constitute a breach, default,
violation or other contravention of the rights of such third party, would be
ineffective with respect to any party to such Transferred Contract or Permit
or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser or the
Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to such Transferred Contract or Permit.
LivaNova shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent as soon
as practicable after the date hereof (without requiring the payment of any
amounts (except for any amount that Purchaser may agree to reimburse) by any
Seller to any party in order to obtain such partys consent and without any
further consideration paid by Purchaser to any Seller); _provided_ , that
LivaNova shall not be deemed to have breached this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_ if
any such consent is not obtained notwithstanding that LivaNova shall have
exercised reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the
Initial Closing Date, LivaNova shall provide notice to each third party
(including any Governmental Entity) to whom notice of the Acquisition is
required to be given prior to the Initial Closing under the terms of any
Transferred Contract or Permit.

(b) If any such consent as referred to in the preceding clause (a) is not
obtained prior to the Initial Closing, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing in _Article VII_ , the Initial Closing shall nonetheless
take place on the terms set forth herein and, from and after the date of
the Closing until the eighteen month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date,
LivaNova shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts to secure such
consent as promptly as practicable after the Applicable Closing Date. LivaNova
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser (with each
party being responsible for its own out-of-pocket expenses, but without
requiring the payment of any amounts (except for any amount that Purchaser
may agree to reimburse) by any Seller to any party in order to obtain such
partys consent and without any further consideration paid by Purchaser to any
Seller) in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement proposed by
Purchaser (and shall enter into such a Contract with Purchaser documenting
such arrangement in connection with the Closing) under which (w) Purchaser or
the Transferred Subsidiaries shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal
rights of such third party or violating any Law) the economic rights and
benefits, x) Sellers and their respective affiliates shall follow reasonable
directions of Purchaser in connection with actions taken or omitted to
be taken under the Transferred Contract with respect to which the consent has
not been obtained, including enforcing any rights thereunder, (y) Sellers or
their respective affiliates shall remit to Purchaser any monies, rights or
other consideration received in connection with the relevant Transferred
Contract, and (z) Purchaser or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall assume any
related economic burden and any other Liability (including the amount of any
related Tax costs imposed on Sellers or their respective affiliates) and risk
of assumption with respect to such Transferred Contract to the extent any such
obligations would have constituted Assumed Liabilities had the relevant
consent been obtained prior to the Initial Closing and the parties hereto
agree to treat Purchaser or any of its affiliates, as the case may be, as the
owner of the Transferred Contract for all Tax purposes. Following the Closing
until the eighteen month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date, until such
consent is obtained, Purchaser will, and will cause each of its affiliates to,
exercise reasonable best efforts to discharge the obligations under the terms
of any Contract that has not yet been transferred or assigned due to the
failure to receive such consent as if such Contract had been so transferred or
assigned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to structure any arrangements
described in this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_ in a manner that minimizes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law any deduction or withholding for Taxes on
payments in connection with such arrangements.

 



5 Section 1.05 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, Purchaser, Sellers and any of their respective affiliates shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from
any amounts payable under the terms of this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld pursuant to applicable Law. If any such
amount is required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement (other than any withholding that arises due
to the failure to provide the certificates described in _Section_ __ _
10.05_), such Person making such payment, (i) shall provide the recipient of
such payment with commercially reasonable advance notice, in writing, which
notice shall propose the amount of such withholding (the "Proposed
Withholding Amount") and identify the applicable Law requiring such deduction
and withholding and (ii) shall cooperate with any reasonable request from the
other party in good faith to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or
relief from such obligation to deduct and withhold. Purchaser and LivaNova
shall work together in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding the
Proposed Withholding Amount. Any amount deducted and withheld in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.05_ shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

its affiliates to make any additional representations, warranties or
covenants, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement; (b) a duly

Officer, setting forth (i) LivaNovas good faith calculation in reasonable
detail of its estimates of Net Working Capital, Transferred Subsidiary Cash,

calculation of Net Working Capital, Transferred Subsidiary Cash, Transferred
Subsidiary Debt and the Adjustment Amount. The Initial Closing Statement shall
be prepared using the Accounting Principles in accordance with the definitions
of the foregoing components of the Adjustment Amount and include reasonably
detailed information appropriate to support such calculation. If the Initial
Closing Statement is not delivered to LivaNova within ninety (90) calendar
days after the Initial Closing Date, then LivaNova will have the right
to elect that LivaNovas estimates set forth in the Estimate Report will
constitute the amounts for the Adjusted Initial Closing Date Payment and will
be final, conclusive and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties
hereto.

(b) _Objections; Resolution of Disputes_.

 

(i) Unless LivaNova notifies Purchaser in writing, within sixty (60) calendar
days (such 60-day period, the "Objection Period") after the earlier of (x)
LivaNovas receipt of the Initial Closing Statement and (y) the expiration of
the 90-day period contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_, of any objection
to the computation of the Adjustment Amount set forth therein (or, if the
Initial Closing Statement was not delivered in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.04(a)_, any objection to the computation of the Estimated Adjustment
Amount) (a "Notice of Objection"), the Initial Closing Statement (or the
Estimate Report, as applicable) shall become final and binding. During the
Objection Period and for purposes of LivaNovas review of the Initial Closing
Statement, if any, and preparation of any Notice of Objection, Purchaser shall
permit LivaNova and its Representatives to review the working papers of
Purchaser and its accountants relating to the Initial Closing Statement
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_) and, at LivaNovas request, shall
provide LivaNova and its Representatives (A) any information relating to the
Business reasonably requested and (B) reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books and records of and relating to the Business,
provided, in each case of (A) and (B), that (1) the provision by Purchaser of
such information and access shall be subject to Sellers and their respective
affiliates executing customary hold harmless letters and non-disclosure
agreements, and (2) Purchaser shall not be required to give access to any
information subject to attorney-client or other legal privilege. Any Notice
of Objection shall specify LivaNovas determination of the amount of any
disputed item and the basis for the objections set forth therein in reasonable
detail.

 



8 (ii) If LivaNova provides the Notice of Objection in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)(i)_ to Purchaser within the Objection Period,
Purchaser and LivaNova shall, during the 30-day period following Purchasers
receipt of the Notice of Objection (such 30-day period, the "Resolution
Period"), attempt in good faith to resolve LivaNovas objections set forth in
the Notice of Objection (and, with respect to any items not objected to in
the Notice of Objection, the amount for such item in the Initial Closing
Statement (or the Estimate Report, as applicable) shall be final, conclusive
and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto). All such
discussions related to the Notice of Objection shall be governed by Rule 408
of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rules, and
evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceeding
between the parties hereto. During the Resolution Period, Purchaser and its
Representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of LivaNova
and its accountants relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor
(subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_). If Purchaser and LivaNova are unable
to resolve all such objections within the Resolution Period (or such longer
period as Purchaser and LivaNova may mutually agree in writing), the matters
remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or one of
its affiliates or, if Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and its affiliates are unable
or unwilling to serve, another internationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and LivaNova in writing
(such firm being the "Independent Expert"). Sellers and Purchaser shall
exercise reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Independent Expert shall
be engaged within twenty (20) calendar days following expiration of the
Resolution Period pursuant to an engagement letter among Purchaser, LivaNova
and the Independent Expert. The Independent Expert shall be instructed,
pursuant to such engagement letter, to resolve only those matters set forth
in the Notice of Objection remaining in dispute based solely on the written
submissions of the parties and not to otherwise investigate any matter
independently. Purchaser and LivaNova each agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to the Independent Expert access to such
individuals and such information, books and records as may be reasonably
required by the Independent Expert to make its final determination; provided,
that LivaNova may redact from Tax Returns information to the extent such
information is not primarily related to the Business or the Transferred
Subsidiaries. Purchaser and LivaNova shall also instruct the Independent
Expert to render its reasoned written decision as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date that
information related to the unresolved objections was first presented to the
Independent Expert by Purchaser and LivaNova. With respect to each disputed
line item, such decision shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the Initial Closing
Statement (or, if the Initial Closing Statement was not delivered in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_, in the Estimate Report) or
LivaNova in the Notice of Objection with respect to such disputed line item.
The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding on the parties, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction
thereover. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with
the resolution of such disputed items by the Independent Expert. After the
final determination of the Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall have no further
right to make any claims against LivaNova or any of its affiliates in respect
of the Adjustment Amount to the extent such claim was previously satisfied
with any payment made pursuant to or otherwise resolved in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_. 

(c) _Adjustment Payment_. When used hereunder, the "Adjusted Initial Closing
Date Payment" means an aggregate amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price,
_plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.04(b)_. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Adjustment Amount has
been finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)_, (x) if
the Initial Closing Date Payment is less than the Adjusted Initial Closing
Date Payment by more than the Collar Amount, Purchaser shall pay to LivaNova
the entire amount of such shortfall (without regard to the Collar Amount),
and (y) if the Initial Closing Date Payment is greater than the Adjusted
Initial Closing Date Payment by more than the Collar Amount, LivaNova shall
pay to Purchaser the entire amount of such excess (without regard to the
Collar Amount). Any payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of

 



9  immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser
or LivaNova, as the case may be (such designation to be made at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is due). The
parties hereto agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.04(c)_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 2.05 _Deferred Closing_ _s_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent agreed by LivaNova and Purchaser, the conveyance, assignment,
transfer, delivery and acceptance of the Transferred Assets (the "Deferred
Assets") located in certain jurisdictions as may be agreed upon by LivaNova
and Purchaser prior to the Initial Closing (the "Deferred Closing
Countries"), and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (the "Deferred
Liabilities") relating to the Business conducted in the Deferred Closing
Countries or relating to such Deferred Assets shall not occur on the Initial
Closing Date.

(b) The conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery and acceptance of the
Deferred Assets, and the assumption of the Deferred Liabilities with respect
to a Deferred Closing Country shall if reasonably practicable take place at
the Initial Closing or otherwise as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter but in any event on a date not more than six (6) months after the
Initial Closing Date, or such other date as LivaNova and Purchaser may
mutually agree in writing (each such closing, a "Deferred Closing") to be held
at such place as LivaNova and Purchaser may agree in writing (each day on
which a Deferred Closing takes place, being a "Deferred Closing Date"). From
and after the Initial Closing, and until the applicable Deferred Closing Date,
the Business conducted in the Deferred Closing Countries shall be held for
Purchasers benefit and account and shall be managed and operated by the
applicable Seller for Purchasers benefit and account, with all gains, income,
losses, Liabilities, Taxes or other items generated thereby to be for
Purchasers account and borne by Purchaser, in each case, as if the transfer
of the Deferred Assets and Deferred Liabilities had occurred at the Initial
Closing in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree to treat Purchaser (or its designee) as the owner of
such Deferred Assets for all Tax purposes as of the Initial Closing Date,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, at each Deferred Closing, LivaNova and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, execute
and deliver a Local Transfer Agreement and any other conveyance documents
required under applicable Laws for the transfer of applicable Transferred
Assets and Assumed Liabilities to Purchaser in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 1.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no conditions required to be
satisfied or waived prior to a Deferred Closing in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ with respect to a
Deferred Closing Country.

 

(e) Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references in this
Agreement to the "Closing" or "Closing Date" shall, with respect to any
Deferred Asset or Deferred Liability, be deemed to refer to the applicable
Deferred Closing or Deferred Closing Date, respectively.

 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the portion of the Purchase Price allocable
to any Deferred Closing Country, as agreed to by the parties (each a
"Deferred Closing Country Amount"), shall have been paid on the Initial
Closing Date. In the event that a local payment of some or all of the relevant
Deferred Closing Country Amount is required in a particular jurisdiction,
on the Deferred Closing Date for a Deferred Closing Country, Purchaser shall
cause the applicable designee of Purchaser to pay an amount equal to the
required local payment to the applicable Seller on the Deferred Closing Date
by wire 

 



10  transfer of immediately available funds to the applicable Sellers local
bank account to be designated by LivaNova in a written notice delivered to
Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days before such Deferred Closing.
Within ten (10) Business Days following the Deferred Closing Date, LivaNova
shall, or shall cause the applicable subsidiary to, reimburse to Purchaser an
amount equal to the relevant required local payment in U.S. dollars, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account to be designated
by Purchaser in a written notice delivered to LivaNova at least five (5)
Business Days before such Deferred Closing. For all Tax purposes, Purchaser
and Sellers agree to treat any payments made under this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LIVANOVA AND THE ASSET SELLERS

LivaNova and each Asset Seller, where applicable, hereby represents and
warrants to Purchaser, as of the date hereof and, after giving effect to the
Restructuring, as of the Initial Closing Date, that, except (a) for any
information related to the Business set forth in the reports of LivaNova
publicly available and filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (including
exhibits and other information incorporated by reference therein, but
excluding any risk factor or forward-looking disclosures contained in such
documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks
included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements
that are similarly nonspecific or predictive, cautionary or forward-looking)
or (b) as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by LivaNova to
Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure
Schedule") ( _provided_ that any disclosure in a section or subsection of the
Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the corresponding section or
subsection of this _Article III_ , as well as to matters represented or
warranted in such other sections or subsections of this _Article III_
with respect to which it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure applies or qualifies).

Section 3.01  _Organization and Standing_. Each Seller is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Each Seller is
duly qualified or licensed in all material respects as a foreign corporation
to do business and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the ownership of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the character of the
material Transferred Assets occupied, owned, leased, operated or otherwise
held by such Seller in such jurisdiction or the operation of the Business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary. LivaNova has the requisite
corporate (or similar organizational) power and authority to enable it to own
the Transferred Shares owned by it, and each Asset Seller has the requisite
corporate power and authority to enable it to own, operate, lease or otherwise
hold the Transferred Assets occupied, owned, leased, operated or otherwise
held by it, and to conduct the Business as currently conducted. Each Seller is
qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership of the Transferred Assets or the operation of the Business by
such Seller as now being conducted or as contemplated to be conducted makes
such qualification necessary, except to the extent the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each member
of the Seller Group has the requisite corporate (or similar organizational)
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered by it in connection
with this Agreement, including each Local Transfer Agreement, the
Transition Services Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement, the Saluggia
Leases and the agreements entered into and documents executed in connection
with the implementation of the Restructuring (the "Ancillary

 



11  Agreements") to which it will be a party and to consummate the Acquisition,
to the extent applicable, and the other transactions contemplated to be
consummated by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements. Each
member of the Seller Group has taken all corporate (or similar organizational)
action required by its articles of association, certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or similar organizational documents, as applicable, to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
it will be a party and to authorize the consummation of the Acquisition, to
the extent applicable, and the other transactions contemplated to be
consummated by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements. Each member
of the Seller Group has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, prior
to the Applicable Closing Date, will have duly executed and delivered each
Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party, and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser) this Agreement
constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party will
after the Applicable Closing Date (assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other parties thereto) constitute, its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and to general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (the
"Enforceability Exceptions").

Section 3.03 _Non-Contravention and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement
does not, and neither (x) the execution, delivery and performance by each
member of the Seller Group of each Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a
party nor (y) the consummation by each Seller of the transactions contemplated
to be consummated by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements
(including the Restructuring and the sale, assignment, sublease, conveyance,
transfer or delivery of all of the Transferred Assets, notwithstanding the
applicability of _Section_ __ _ 1.04_) will, (i) conflict with or violate
the articles of association, certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents, as applicable, of such Seller or its affiliates,
(ii) except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, result in any material breach of, constitute a material default
under, or create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or
cancel, or require any notice or Consent under, any Business Contract or
material Permit, (iii) conflict with or violate any judgment, order or decree
("Judgment") or federal, national, supranational, state, provincial or local
or administrative statute, law, ordinance, rule, code or regulation, or
other similar requirements with similar effects of any Governmental Entity
("Law") applicable to such Seller, any of the Transferred Assets or the
Transferred Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation of any Lien (other
than Permitted Liens) upon any of the Transferred Assets, the Transferred
Shares or the properties or assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries, except, in
the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), any such items that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No consent, waiver, exemption, permit, license, approval or authorization
("Consent") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or notification
to, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by the Seller
Group in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which they will be a party or the

(c) To the extent that the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery or attempted sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery to Purchaser of any Business Contract or material Permit or any claim
or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is
prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any amendments, Permits or
Consents, no Law,

 



12  Permit or Contractual restriction applicable to such Business Contract or
material Permit would prevent or restrict the parties hereto from entering
into commercially reasonable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing
or subcontracting or enforcing any Business Contract or material Permit on
behalf of the other party that is intended beneficiary thereof) to provide the
parties the economic and operational equivalent of obtaining such amendment,
Permit or Consent as contemplated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

(d) No Law or Contractual restriction applicable to any Mixed-Use Contract
that is a Business Contract would prevent or restrict the parties from
entering into any commercial arrangement (including by means of
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing or enforcing such Mixed Contract
on behalf of the other party that is intended beneficiary thereof) to cause
the rights, benefits and obligations of such Mixed Contract to be allocated
among Sellers, Purchaser and their respective affiliates in the manner
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_.

Section 3.04 _Transferred Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each Transferred Subsidiary is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation, which are set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Each Transferred
Subsidiary has the requisite corporate (or similar organizational) power and
authority and possesses all permits, licenses, franchises, exemptions of,
approvals or authorizations from any Governmental Entity ("Permits") necessary
to enable it to own, operate, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as contemplated
to be conducted, other than such Permits the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Prior to the date hereof, complete and correct copies of the
organizational documents of each Transferred Subsidiary have been made
available to Purchaser and such organizational documents remain in full force
and effect as of the date hereof.

(b) _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each of the
Transferred Subsidiaries and all of the authorized and outstanding shares of
capital stock (or comparable interest) of each Transferred Subsidiary and the
name of the holders of such shares of capital stock (or comparable interest).
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or comparable interest) in
each Transferred Subsidiary and the Transferred Joint Venture have been duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and, as applicable, non-
assessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or comparable
interest in each Transferred Subsidiary and all of the registered capital of
the Transferred Joint Venture have been validly issued and are fully paid and,
as applicable, non-assessable. Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, Purchaser shall be the record and beneficial
owner of all outstanding shares or comparable interest in each
Transferred Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens, and LivaNova Holding SAS
shall remain the record and beneficial owner, free and clear of any Liens, of
the Transferred Joint Venture, which represents 49% of the registered capital
of MicroPort Sorin CRM (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Except as provided for in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, convertible,
exercisable, or exchangeable securities or other agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the Transferred Shares or the
Transferred Joint Venture, pursuant to which LivaNova or a Transferred
Subsidiary is or may become obligated to sell, issue, transfer or otherwise
dispose of or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of, or any other comparable interest in, or any securities exercisable

any other comparable interest in, a Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred
Joint Venture, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any
securities of any Transferred Subsidiary or the Transferred Joint Venture,
and no securities evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. None of the Transferred Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote

 



13  (or are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the equity holders of such Transferred
Subsidiary on any matter. There are no contractual rights granted to any
third party to have the capital stock of any Transferred Subsidiary or the
Transferred Joint Venture registered for sale to the public in connection with
the Laws of any jurisdiction. Other than the Transferred Joint Venture, no
Transferred Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
equity interest, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable for capital
stock or other equity interest, in any other person. There are no phantom
stock, stock-based performance unit, profit participation or other equity-

described in clauses (i) through (v) above are referred to herein,
collectively, as "Permitted Liens").

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 3.08_ does not apply to Intellectual Property, which
is the subject of _Section_ __ _ 3.11_.

Section 3.09 _Condition and Sufficiency of Assets_.

 

(a) The Transferred Assets, together with any services (and the assets,
properties and rights used to perform such services) provided by Sellers or
their subsidiaries pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, (i) are all of the
Assets, real properties (including plants, buildings, and other structures and
improvements located thereon, fixtures contained therein, and
appurtenances thereto), personal properties, information-technology assets,
title, interest and rights that are necessary to operate and conduct the
Business immediately after the Initial Closing substantially in the manner in
which it is currently being conducted and as it is being conducted
immediately prior to the Binding Offer Date and prior to the Closing Date; and
(ii) except for Inventory disposed of in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice of Sellers, constitute all of the Assets, real
properties (including plants, buildings, and other structures and improvements
located thereon, fixtures contained therein, and appurtenances thereto),
personal properties, information-technology assets, title, interest
and rights owned by Sellers or their subsidiaries and affiliates that are
primarily used or primarily held for use by Sellers and Transferred
Subsidiaries in the conduct of the Business as it is currently being conducted
and as contemplated to be conducted. Assuming (x) that the Consents disclosed
in _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ of the Disclosure Schedule are obtained and (y) that
there is no fact or circumstance specifically attributable to Purchaser (and
that would not reasonably be expected to be applicable to another purchaser
of the Business) that would prohibit Purchaser from using the Transferred
Assets, Purchaser shall be able to use all of the Transferred Assets in
substantially the same manner immediately after the Initial Closing as such
Assets, properties, title, interest and rights are used, or such rights are
taken advantage of by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries as of the
date hereof and as of immediately prior to the Initial Closing and reflected
in the Financial Statements. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no fact or
circumstance exists that would prohibit Purchaser from using the Transferred
Assets in substantially the same manner immediately after the Initial Closing
as such Assets, properties, title, interest and rights are used, or such
rights are taken advantage of by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries
as of the date hereof and as of immediately prior to the Initial Closing and

tear excepted) suitable and adequate in all material respects for continued

levels with respect to the Business are in accordance with LivaNovas policy,
consistent with past practice, and, with respect to any Inventory in excess of
LivaNovas policy, appropriate reserves have been established in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied. There are no material accepted and unfulfilled
orders related to the Business for the sale of products and services entered
into by LivaNova and its subsidiaries as of the date hereof. There are no
material claims against LivaNova or any of its subsidiaries to return any
merchandise related to the Business by reason of alleged overshipments,
defective merchandise or otherwise.

 



16 (c) This _Section_ __ _ 3.09_ does not apply to Intellectual Property, which
is the subject of _Section_ __ _ 3.11_.

Section 3.10 _Real Property_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth all real
property (i) which any of the Transferred Subsidiaries owns, licenses, leases
(as tenant) or subleases (as subtenant), or (ii) which any Seller or any of
its retained subsidiaries owns, licenses, leases or subleases primarily in the
conduct of the Business (the "Real Property"). The Real Property constitutes
all of the real property used in conducting the Business as currently
conducted and as contemplated to be conducted. LivaNova has made available to
Purchaser true and complete copies of all material leases, subleases,
licenses and other occupancy agreements (and all material amendments,
modifications, assignments or other agreements related thereto) pursuant to

possess the Real Property or a third party has a right to use, occupy or
possess the Real Property (such agreements shall be collectively referred to
herein as the "Leases").

(x) is a commercial lease subject to Articles L.145-1 _et seq_. of the French
Commercial Code, (y) gives the lessee thereunder a right of renewal, and (z)
does not expire within twenty-four (24) months of the date of this Agreement.

(d) There are no pending or (to the Knowledge of Sellers)
threatened condemnation, expropriation, eminent domain, adverse possession,
claims of adverse rights or similar proceedings affecting the use or occupancy
of any Real Property. No Seller nor any of its subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) has received written notice from any Governmental
Entity that the Real Property is in violation of any Law that would interfere
with the use of such Real Property in the operation of the Business or that
would prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Sellers to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or on a timely basis and, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, there are no such outstanding violations.

 

(e) None of the Real Property has suffered any material damage by fire or
other casualty which has not heretofore been repaired and restored in all
material respects.

(f) To the Knowledge of Sellers, all such Leases are valid and binding and the
obligations of Sellers or Transferred Subsidiaries party thereto are in full
force and effect and are enforceable against such Sellers or Transferred
Subsidiaries, subject, as to enforcement, to the Enforceability Exceptions.
The Seller Group collectively have good title to, or in the case of any
Assumed Lease Real Property, valid and binding leasehold interests in, all

any of the Transferred Subsidiaries has or could reasonably expect to have any
Liability or obligation (each an "Employee Benefit Plan"). _Section_ __ _
3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule separately identifies each Employee
Benefit Plan that is not subject to United States Law maintained primarily in
respect of any current or former Employees who are located outside of the
United States (a "Foreign Benefit Plan") and the non-U.S. jurisdiction
applicable to each Foreign Benefit Plan. Prior to the date hereof, copies of
the Employee Benefit Plans (or summaries thereof) have been made available to
Purchaser other than any Employee Benefit Plan that Sellers are prohibited
from making available to Purchaser as a result of applicable Laws relating
to the safeguarding of data privacy. With respect to each Assumed Benefit
Plan, copies of the applicable plan document or agreement, trust, insurance
contract, funding vehicle, most recent financial statement and/or actuarial
report, and material or non-routine filings with, or notices or correspondence
from a Governmental Entity have been made available to Purchaser.

 

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and has received a favorable determination or approval letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to such qualification, or
may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to a prototype
plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for such reliance, or has
time remaining for application to the IRS for a determination of the qualified
status of such Employee Benefit Plan for any period for which such Employee
Benefit Plan would not otherwise be covered by an IRS determination and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, no event or omission has occurred that would cause
any Employee Benefit Plan to lose such qualification.

 



26 (c) (i) Each Assumed Benefit Plan and, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a material impact on the Business, each other Employee
Benefit Plan is, and has been operated in material compliance with applicable
Laws and is and has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with applicable Laws and with its terms, (ii) no Proceeding (other than those
relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, threatened with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan or, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Business,
each other Employee Benefit Plan or any fiduciary or service provider thereof,
(iii) all payments and/or contributions required to have been made with
respect to all Assumed Benefit Plans or, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a material impact on the Business, with respect to each other
Employee Benefit Plan, either have been made or have been accrued in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plan and
applicable Law, and (iv) the Assumed Benefit Plans or, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Business, each other
Employee Benefit Plan, satisfy in all material respects the minimum coverage
and discrimination requirements under the Code.

(d) No Employee Benefit Plan is, and none of the Sellers or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates maintains, contributes to, or is required to
contribute to or otherwise has liability that has not been paid in full under,
(i) any employee benefit plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA,
Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (iii) any funded welfare
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, (iv) any "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c)
of the Code), or (v) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such term
is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA).

 

(e) None of the Employee Benefit Plans provides health care or any other non-
pension benefits to any Employees after their employment is terminated (other
than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar Law),
and none of the Sellers or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
promised to provide such benefits to Employees.

(f) (i) Each Assumed Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
modified to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law, including the
elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder and (ii) except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Business,
neither Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof has announced their intention
to modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or adopt any arrangement or
program which, once established, would come within the definition of an
Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(g) Each Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and maintained in all material respects in operational and
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance
thereunder. No payment to be made under any Employee Benefit Plan is, or
to the Knowledge of Sellers, will be, subject to the penalties of Section
409A(a)(1) of the Code. None of Sellers or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
has any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any
individual for any excise taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code.

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting, funding
or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
any current or former Employee or other service provider working in the
Business; (ii) could result in any "parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be
reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (iii) result in a
requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any
current or former Employee or other service provider working in the Business.

 



27 (i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to each
Foreign Benefit Plan, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.17(i)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule: (i) except as would not reasonably be expected to have a

42 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.07(a)_, from
the Binding Offer Date until the Initial Closing, each of the parties shall
(i) use its reasonable best efforts to promptly make all filings and promptly
obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities and officials that may be or become necessary or advisable for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals and (iii) provide as promptly as practicable such
information to any Governmental Entity as such Governmental Entity may request
in connection herewith. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto,
as applicable, agrees to file promptly (but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Binding Offer Date) the filings and notifications
required under any Merger Control Law applicable to the Acquisition and to
obtain French Foreign Investment Clearance and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such
Merger Control Law or for purposes of such French Foreign Investment
Clearance. None of LivaNova, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand,
may, without the consent of the other, (x) cause any such filing or submission
applicable to it to be withdrawn or refiled for any reason, including to
provide the applicable Governmental Entity with additional time to review any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser will pay all fees or make other payments to any
Governmental Entity in order to obtain any such authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.07(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(b)_, for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 5.07(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(b)_, the "reasonable best efforts" of Purchaser shall
include the obligation to take any such actions, undertakings or measures as
may be necessary to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Entity
(including, for purposes _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)(ii)_, the French Foreign
Investment Clearance from the French Ministry of Economy) to the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, on such terms as may be required by such
Governmental Entity, but shall in no event include (i) any obligation to agree
to any undertaking or condition that constitutes a Burdensome Effect or (ii)
any obligation to take an action or measure that constitutes a Burdensome
Effect.

(d) Purchaser undertakes that it will not, and shall procure that no member
of the Purchaser Group shall, either alone or acting in concert with others,
from the Binding Offer Date through the Initial Closing: (a) acquire or offer
to acquire (or cause another person acting on its behalf to acquire or offer
to acquire); or (b) execute definitive transaction documentation (or cause
another person acting on its behalf to execute definitive transaction
documentation) that, if carried into effect, would result in the acquisition
of, a business that competes with the Business being acquired by Purchaser, in
each case, if such action might reasonably be expected to prejudice or delay
the obtainment of the approval of Governmental Entities listed on _Section_
__ _ 7.01(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and LivaNova, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify the other of any communication it or any of its
affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that
are the subject of this Agreement or any Assets or Liabilities of
any Transferred Subsidiary and permit the other to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Entity. Neither
Purchaser, on the one hand, nor LivaNova, on the other hand, shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Purchaser, on the one
hand, and LivaNova, on the other hand, will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in

 



43  seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under
any Applicable Merger Control Law. Purchaser, on the one hand, and LivaNova,
on the other hand, will provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise with respect to any assets or liabilities of the
Transferred Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such materials may be
redacted, to the extent permitted by any applicable Law, (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Business or the value of LivaNova
and its subsidiaries after the consummation of the Acquisition, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege, work product protection
or confidentiality concerns, to the extent that such attorney-client or other
privilege, work product protection or confidentiality concerns are not
governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine.

Section 5.08 _Intercompany Accounts_ _and Agreements_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.08(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, immediately prior to the Initial Closing, LivaNova shall, and shall
cause its subsidiaries to, (i) terminate, effective as of the Applicable
Closing Date, all Contracts between LivaNova or any of its subsidiaries (other
than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Transferred
Subsidiary, on the other hand and (ii) cause each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries to be released from all covenants, agreements, Claims and
Liabilities under any such Contracts.

 

(b) At any time prior to the Initial Closing, all intercompany receivables,
payables and loans between LivaNova or any of its subsidiaries (other than
the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Transferred
Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be settled in such manner as is
contemplated by the Restructuring Plan.

 

Section 5.09 _LivaNova Guarantees_. Purchaser acknowledges that in the course
of conduct of the Business, LivaNova and its affiliates have entered into
arrangements (a) in which guarantees, letters of credit, bonds or similar
arrangements were issued by LivaNova or its affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) or (b) in which LivaNova or its affiliates (other
than the Transferred Subsidiaries) are the primary obligors on other
Contracts, in any such case to support or facilitate the Business, which
arrangements entered into by LivaNova and its affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b),
including those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(and such arrangements are hereinafter referred to as the "Seller
Credit Support Obligations"). It is understood that the Seller Credit Support
Obligations are not intended to continue after the Initial Closing. Purchaser
agrees that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain replacement
Seller Credit Support Obligations (which shall include the full and
unconditional release of LivaNova and its affiliates) that will be in effect
at the Initial Closing or, in the case of Seller Credit Support Obligations
described in the foregoing clause (b), will use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange for itself or one of its subsidiaries to be substituted as the
primary obligor thereon as of the Initial Closing through an assumption,
accession, acknowledgement or similar agreement (which shall include the full
and unconditional release of LivaNova and its affiliates) with the beneficiary
of the applicable Seller Credit Support Obligation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such replacement or substitution is not practicable after
a reasonable period, Purchaser will not renew such arrangement for a term
lasting beyond the eighteen month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date if
such renewal would cause the Seller Credit Support Obligation to be extended
beyond such date. Whether or not Purchaser is able to satisfy the terms of
the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses incurred by any of them
relating to the Seller Credit Support Obligations, and shall not amend or
modify in a manner that would increase the obligations of any Seller
Indemnitee (other than an immaterial increase) any Contract then subject to or
guaranteed or otherwise supported by a

 



44  Seller Credit Support Obligation without the consent of LivaNova in its sole
discretion unless Purchaser replaces the applicable Seller Support Obligation
concurrently with such amendment or modification. Purchaser agrees that, with
respect to any Seller Credit Support Obligation, its reasonable best efforts
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ shall include, if requested, the
execution and delivery by Purchaser, or by an affiliate of Purchaser
acceptable to the beneficiary of such Seller Credit Support Obligation, of a
replacement guarantee that is substantially in the form of such Seller Credit
Support Obligation. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
providing replacement credit support or the release or substitution of the
Seller Credit Support Obligations shall be borne by Purchaser.

 

Section 5.10 _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Applicable Closing Date, the Business and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by LivaNovas or its
affiliates insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs, other
than by any insurance policies acquired directly by and in the name of
Transferred Subsidiaries that continue coverage after such Applicable Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, LivaNova and its affiliates shall retain
all rights to control their respective insurance policies and programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back
or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of their insurance policies
and programs, notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to
any liabilities of Purchaser or its affiliates (including any Transferred
Subsidiary) and nothing herein shall require LivaNova or any of its
affiliates to maintain any insurance after the Initial Closing. Neither
Purchaser nor any of its affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries)
shall make any claims under any insurance policies (including any claims-made
insurance policies) of LivaNova or its affiliates. To the extent a claim is
paid under an insurance policy of any of LivaNova or its affiliates (other
than the Transferred Subsidiaries), none of the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ in connection
therewith.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_,
with respect to events or circumstances relating to the Business, the
Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, or the operations, assets and
Liabilities in respect thereof, that occurred or existed prior to the Initial
Closing Date that are covered by insurance policies of LivaNova or its
subsidiaries (excluding any self-insured policies or programs), Purchaser may
cause LivaNova or its subsidiaries to (in which case LivaNova shall cause
its subsidiaries to), make claims under such policies; _provided_ , _however_
, that:

(i) by making, or causing to be made, such claims, (x) Purchaser and its
affiliates agree to reimburse the Sellers and their respective affiliates for
any costs incurred by the Sellers or their respective affiliates as a result
of such claims, including any retroactive or prospective premium adjustments
associated with such coverage, as such amounts are determined in accordance
with those policies from time to time and (y) Purchaser and its affiliates
agree to pay and satisfy any deductible or retention amount associated with
all such claims;

(ii) neither Purchaser nor any of its affiliates shall make any such claims
if, and to the extent that, such claims are covered by any insurance policy
issued to or maintained by Purchaser or its affiliates; and

(iii) neither the Sellers nor any of their respective affiliates shall be
liable under any circumstances for the inability of Purchaser or its
affiliates to collect insurance proceeds under any insurance policy.

 



45 Section 5.11 _Indemnification of_ _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Purchaser, on the one hand, and LivaNova, on the other hand, agree that
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses and
other rights for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Initial
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Initial
Closing, now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers,
as the case may be, of the Business as provided in the organizational
documents of a Transferred Subsidiary shall survive the Initial Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect to the extent provided in the
following sentence.

 

(b) Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary to maintain in effect
any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions and other rights of the organizational documents of each
Transferred Subsidiary with any of the respective current or former directors
or officers of the Business, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, for
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing.

(c) In the event a Transferred Subsidiary or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of such Transferred Subsidiary shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

 

Section 5.12 _Further Action; Wrong Pockets_ ; Customer Inquiries.

 

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Initial Closing, at Purchasers
request, LivaNova shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its
affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to (i) execute and deliver to
Purchaser such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance and assignment,
provide such materials and information and do or cause all such other
actions as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary, appropriate or advisable
in order to effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to
confirm Purchasers title to, all of the Transferred Assets, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or contract, to put
Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the Transferred Assets
and otherwise to cause Sellers to fulfill their obligations under this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) cooperate with Purchaser at
Purchasers expense to enforce the terms of any Transferred Contract,
including terms relating to confidentiality and Intellectual Property rights;
(iii) cooperate with Purchaser in its reasonable best efforts to ensure the
orderly transfer of those business relationships of Sellers existing prior to
the Initial Closing and relating to the Business; (iv) refer to Purchaser all
inquiries relating to the Business; and (v) promptly deliver to Purchaser any
mail, packages and other communications addressed to LivaNova or any of its
affiliates relating to the Business.

 

(b) If, following the Initial Closing, any right, property or Asset not
forming part of the Transferred Assets is found to have been transferred to
Purchaser (or retained by one of the Transferred Subsidiaries) in error,
either directly or indirectly (including as a result of the Restructuring),
Purchaser shall transfer, or shall cause its affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) to transfer, such right, property or Asset (and any
related liability) as soon as practicable to LivaNova or the affiliate of
LivaNova indicated by LivaNova.

 

(c) If, following the Initial Closing, any right, property or Asset forming
part of the Transferred Assets is found to remain in the possession of
LivaNova or one of its affiliates in error, either directly or indirectly
(including as a result of the Restructuring), LivaNova shall transfer, or
shall cause its affiliates to transfer, such right, property or Asset (and any
related liability) as soon as practicable to Purchaser or the affiliate of
Purchaser indicated by Purchaser.

 



46 (d) If, following the Initial Closing, LivaNova or one of its affiliates, on
the one hand, or Purchaser or one of its affiliates, on the other hand,
receives any funds properly belonging to the other party in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the receiving party will promptly so advise such
other party, will segregate and hold such funds in trust for the benefit of
such other party and will promptly deliver such funds, together with any
interest earned thereon, to an account or accounts designated in writing by
such other party. For a period of eighteen (18) months following the Initial
Closing, representatives from the accounting teams of each of LivaNova and
MicroPort or its subsidiaries shall meet at least once per calendar month in
order to review, discuss and reconcile changes in, and the status of
the collection of, trade accounts receivables included in the Transferred
Assets transferred to Purchaser at the Initial Closing, including whether (x)
any funds properly belonging to Purchaser have been collected by LivaNova for
Purchasers benefit in accordance with the foregoing sentence or (y) any
funds properly belonging to LivaNova have been collected by Purchaser for
LivaNovas benefit in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 

(e) If any Asset transfer contemplated by the foregoing clauses (b), (c) or
(d) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ is unable to be consummated promptly for
any reason, then, insofar as reasonably possible, the party hereto retaining
such Asset shall thereafter (i) hold such Asset for the use and benefit of the
other party entitled thereto (at the expense of such other party) and (ii)
take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the party entitled thereto
in order to place such party in a substantially similar position as if such
Asset had been transferred as contemplated by the foregoing clauses (b), (c)
or (d) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_.

(f) Any Asset transferred pursuant to the foregoing clauses (b), (c) or (d)
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ prior to Purchasers delivery of the Initial
Closing Statement shall be deemed to have occurred at Closing for purposes of
calculating the Net Working Capital.

 

(g) After the Initial Closing Date, each of LivaNova and its subsidiaries and
Purchaser and its subsidiaries may receive mail, packages, or other
communications (including electronic communications) properly belonging to the
other (or the others subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the
Initial Closing Date, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, each of Seller
and Purchaser authorizes the other and their respective subsidiaries to
receive and open all mail, packages, and other communications received by it
and not unambiguously intended for the other party (or its subsidiaries) or
any of the other partys (or its subsidiaries) officers or directors, and to
retain the same to the extent that they relate to the Business (in the case of
receipt by Purchaser and its subsidiaries) or the other businesses of LivaNova
(in the case of receipt by LivaNova and its subsidiaries), or to the extent
that they do not relate to the Business (in the case of receipt by Purchaser
and its subsidiaries) or the other businesses of LivaNova (in the case of
receipt by LivaNova and its subsidiaries), the receiving party shall promptly
after becoming aware thereof refer, forward, or otherwise deliver such mail,
packages, or other communications (or, in case the same relate to both the
Business and the other businesses of LivaNova, copies thereof) to the other
party. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(g)_ __ are not intended to,
and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by either LivaNova or
Purchaser to permit the other to accept service of process on its behalf, and
neither party is or shall be deemed to be the agent of the other for purposes
of the service of process. For eighteen (18) months after the Closing,
LivaNova shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly notify Purchaser
of each inquiry that LivaNova or any of its subsidiaries receives relating to
the Business from an existing customer of the Business that states its desire
to explore a commercial relationship related to the Business.

 



47 Section 5.13 _Separation of Mixed-Use Contracts_.

(a) Prior to the Initial Closing, LivaNova shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (which shall not include
the giving of any consideration) to separate the Mixed-Use Contracts listed on
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule into two contracts with the
applicable counterparty, one contract with terms and conditions that are
Related to the Business ("Transferred Mixed-Use Contract") and one contract
that relates to the other businesses of the Sellers or their affiliates
("Retained Mixed-Use Contract") in each case on terms and conditions which, in
the aggregate, are substantially the same as those of such Mixed-Use Contract
prior to separation. LivaNova, one of its subsidiaries or a Transferred
Subsidiary shall enter into each Transferred Mixed-Use Contract
with modifications only to (a) change terms and conditions that relate to the
other businesses of the Sellers or that related to all business of the Sellers
prior to such separation, (b) allow for assignability, (c) make other
ministerial changes and (d) make any changes agreed to by Purchaser. If a
Mixed-Use Contract is separated prior to Initial Closing, the Transferred
Mixed-Use Contract shall be a Transferred Contract and the Retained Mixed-Use
Contract shall be an Excluded Contract.

(b) If any Mixed-Use Contract cannot be so separated into two Contracts,
prior to the Initial Closing, from the date of the Initial Closing until the
eighteen month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date, LivaNova shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) separate such Mixed-Use Contract promptly
as practicable after the Initial Closing Date and (ii) cooperate with
Purchaser (with each party being responsible for its own out-of-pocket
expenses, including without limitation, its own legal fees and other de
minimis expenses, but without requiring the payment of any amounts by any
Seller (except if such amount is reimbursed by Purchaser) or Purchaser to any
party in order to obtain such partys consent and without any further
consideration paid by any party to any other party) in any lawful
and commercially reasonable arrangement proposed by Purchaser (including by
means of assignment, receipt of consent from the contractual counterparty,
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangements, or enforcement by the
party to such Mixed Use Contract for the benefit of the other party that is
the intended beneficiary thereof) under which (w) Purchaser or the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of such
third party or violating any Law) the economic rights and benefits under the
Mixed-Use Contract with respect to which the separation has not been completed
to the extent Related to the Business or related to the Transferred
Assets, (x) Purchaser or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall assume any
related economic burden and risk of assumption with respect to such Mixed-Use
Contract to the extent Related to the Business or related to the Transferred
Assets; (y) Seller or its affiliates shall obtain (without infringing upon the
legal rights of such third party or violating any Law) the economic rights and
benefits under the Mixed-Use Contract with respect to which the separation
has not been completed to the extent not Related to the Business or related to
the Transferred Assets, and (z) Seller or its affiliates shall assume any
related economic burden and risk of assumption with respect to such Mixed-Use
Contract to the extent not Related to the Business or related to the
Transferred Assets; provided, that clauses (w) through (z) shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner such that Purchaser yields, on an after-
tax basis, the amount it would have yielded had the applicable consent been
obtained and such Mixed-Use Contract had been transferred at the Initial
Closing Date.

Section 5.14 _Transition Matters._ __

 

(a) During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Initial
Closing, in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the parties shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, cooperate in good
faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to develop and begin
implementing a mutually acceptable transition plan for the migration and
integration of the Business out of the business of the Sellers and into the
business of Purchaser as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ and pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement, in each case, subject to compliance with
applicable Laws (the "Transition Plan"). The Transition Plan shall address
the matters mutually agreed to by the parties. Such cooperation shall include
each party using commercially reasonable efforts to take the following
actions:

 



48 (i) promptly after the date of this Agreement, appointing a transition manager
whose primary responsibility would be to plan and execute such transition and
manage such partys transition team;

(ii) promptly after the date of this Agreement, reviewing the technology,
business operations and administration capabilities to be so transitioned or
migrated, taking into account any issues of separation arising from the
Transition Plan;

 

(iii) establishing transition teams;

 

(iv) setting regular meetings of such transition teams during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Initial Closing; and

 

(v) making available appropriate knowledgeable business, operations,
administration and technology personnel and any other personnel reasonably
needed for such transition and migration planning,

_provided_ that all such activities shall be in compliance with applicable
Law.

(b) During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Initial
Closing, upon the written request of any party, each party shall (i) through
their respective transition teams, cooperate in good faith with the other
party and use commercially reasonable efforts to review the schedules to the
Transition Services Agreement and (ii) negotiate in good faith any amendment,
update or supplement to the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement
that is proposed in writing by the other party. If the parties agree in
writing on the specific terms and conditions of any such amendment, update
or supplement, then such amendment, supplement or update shall be deemed to
be an amendment of the Transition Services Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.3_ of the Transition Services Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
if either party requests the provision of any additional services under the
Transition Services Agreement and such additional service requested by either
party was provided by LivaNova to the Business during the Baseline Period and
is reasonably necessary for Purchaser to operate the Business substantially
as conducted by LivaNova during the Baseline Period, the parties will amend
the applicable schedule to the Transaction Services Agreement to include such
additional service in the manner provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ of the
Transition Services Agreement. "Baseline Period" means the period of twelve
(12) months immediately preceding the Initial Closing.

 

Section 5.15 _MicroPort Shareholder Meeting_. Subject to compliance by
LivaNova with its obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(a)_ and _Section_
__ _ 5.16(b)_ and receipt by MicroPort of the LivaNova Financial Statements
and all information required to be provided by LivaNova pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.16(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Binding Offer Date, MicroPort shall
prepare and submit for approval to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the Circular
and notice of the MicroPort Shareholder Meeting. MicroPort shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve all Hong Kong Stock Exchange comments with
respect to the Circular as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof. MicroPort shall promptly notify and provide to Seller and its
counsel any comments MicroPort or its counsel receives from the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange or other regulatory authority with respect to the Circular and
any request by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or other regulatory authority for
any amendment to the Circular or for additional information. Seller and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity and amount of time to review
and comment on the Circular before it is filed with the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange, and MicroPort shall give good faith and reasonable consideration to
any comments made by Seller or its counsel. MicroPort shall cause the Circular
to be filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and to be disseminated
to MicroPort shareholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws and as promptly as reasonably practicable following resolution
of all

 



49  such comments from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As promptly as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, no later than fourteen (14) calendar days
following the mailing of the Circular to MicroPorts shareholders, MicroPort
shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the MicroPort Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining MicroPort
Shareholder Approval. In addition, MicroPort shall take all action necessary
to enforce the obligations under the Voting Agreements, as in effect on the
date hereof, of the MicroPort shareholders party thereto to vote in favor of
the Acquisition at the MicroPort Shareholder Meeting. From the Binding Offer
Date until the completion of the MicroPort Shareholder Approval, MicroPort
shall not issue any shares unless simultaneously with such issuance (i) any
new shareholder under such issuance executes a Voting Agreement or (ii)
MicroPort has received additional executed Voting Agreements such that the
total shares represented by the collective Voting Agreements received by
MicroPort is sufficient to obtain the MicroPort Shareholder Approval at the
MicroPort Shareholder Meeting.

 

Section 5.16 _Seller Pre-Closing Cooperation_.

 

(a) LivaNova shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to MicroPort a copy
of the LivaNova Financial Statements as soon as practicable, but in any event
shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver such LivaNova Financial
Statements no later than March 1, 2018.

(b) LivaNova shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide MicroPort with
such information (financial or otherwise) concerning LivaNova, its
subsidiaries (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) and the Business that
may be reasonably requested by MicroPort in connection with the preparation
of the Circular to enable MicroPort to obtain MicroPort Shareholder Approval
in satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_.

 

(c) LivaNova shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such assistance
as may be reasonably requested by KPMG in connection with the preparation by
KPMG of historical, forecast or pro forma financial information that is
related to the Business for purposes of the Circular. In furtherance of the
foregoing, LivaNova hereby consents to the inclusion of the LivaNova
Financial Statements in the Circular in accordance with applicable Law in
connection with the Acquisition and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its independent accounting firm to provide its consent for the inclusion
of its accountants report on the LivaNova Financial Statements in the
Circular.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, no failure
by LivaNova to perform the obligations contained in clauses (a) through (c)
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall be the basis for the failure of the
satisfaction of the closing condition contained in  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_
if the MicroPort Shareholder Approval has been obtained.

(e) Prior to the Initial Closing Date, LivaNova (at the expense of Purchaser)
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide to MicroPort and its subsidiaries, such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by MicroPort, its subsidiaries and/or its or their
respective Representatives that is customary in connection with arranging debt
financing with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,

its financing sources, and (ii) assisting in the preparation of offering
memoranda, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents reasonably requested by Purchaser or its
Representatives in connection with the financing (including using reasonable
best efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the financing and delivery of one or more customary
representation letters).

 



50 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall require LivaNova or any of its subsidiaries
to: (i) take any action that would reasonably be expected to unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of LivaNova or any of its
subsidiaries; (ii) take any action in violation of any applicable Law; (iii)
deliver opinions of external or internal counsel; (iv) provide access to or
disclose information that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize attorney-
client privilege or contravene Law or violate any Contract; (v) waive or
amend any terms of any Contract; or (vi) execute any documents or provide any
certifications, guarantees or representations and warranties or (vii) take any
corporate, limited liability or other organization actions (except for any of
the foregoing that may be executed by the Transferred Subsidiaries or their

Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder, and that the ability of Purchaser to obtain the benefit of the
bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties
hereto would be significantly impaired if LivaNova breached the provisions of

that none of its subsidiaries shall, until the date falling twelve (12) months
after the Initial Closing Date, directly or indirectly, either
individually or acting in concert with another Person or Persons, own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business that competes or is preparing to compete
with the Business anywhere in the world;  _provided_ that, the restriction in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(a)_ shall not: (i) prevent LivaNova or any of its
affiliates from carrying on the Business for the benefit of Purchaser between
the Initial Closing Date and any Deferred Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement; (ii) prevent LivaNova or any of its affiliates from
fulfilling any obligation pursuant to any Transaction Document or (iii)
prevent LivaNova from engaging in the Seller Groups existing businesses as

51 (b) Unless Purchaser agrees otherwise in writing, LivaNova agrees that, for
the period commencing on the Initial Closing Date and expiring on the second

concert with another Person or Persons: (i) induce, knowingly solicit or
encourage, or attempt to induce, knowingly solicit or encourage, any Employee
who receives an offer of employment from Purchaser or its affiliate to reject
such offer of employment or (ii) solicit any Transferred Employee for
employment, engagement or any similar arrangement with any member of the

restrictions contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_ shall not prohibit
(i) any advertisement or general solicitation (or hiring as a result thereof)
that is not specifically targeted at any Employee or (ii) the solicitation of
any such individual whose employment with MicroPort or its controlled
affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) terminated after the
Initial Closing and at least six (6) months prior to the initiation of any
employment discussion with LivaNova or its subsidiaries.

(c) Unless LivaNova agrees otherwise in writing, Purchaser and MicroPort agree
that, for the period commencing on the Initial Closing Date and expiring on
the second anniversary of the Initial Closing Date, MicroPort shall not, and

affiliates terminated after the Initial Closing and at least six (6) months
prior to the initiation of any employment discussion with MicroPort or its
subsidiaries.

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge that the restrictive covenants set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and
area restrictions and are necessary to protect LivaNova, the goodwill of the
Business and the substantial investment in the Business made by Purchaser
hereunder. The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment determines that a specific
time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation
or any other relevant feature of this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ is unreasonable,
arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical
area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by
such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may
be enforced against the applicable party.

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

 

Section 6.01 _Transfer of Employment_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall (i) cause each of the Transferred Subsidiaries to continue
to employ all of their respective employees as of the Applicable Closing Date
and (ii) at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Applicable Closing
Date, offer, or cause its affiliates to offer, employment to or continue to
employ (where employment continues automatically by operation of Law,
including for ARD Employees) each Employee who is not employed by the
Transferred Subsidiaries and who is actively employed and who does not
transfer automatically by operation of Law (including employees on vacation,
holiday, jury duty or other similar absence) immediately prior to the
Applicable Closing Date, with such employment to be effective as of 12:01 a.m.
on the Applicable Closing Date (the "Offer-and-Acceptance Employees"). With
respect to each Offer-and-Acceptance Employee who is not actively employed
due to an approved leave of absence as of immediately prior to the Applicable
Closing Date (each, an "Inactive Employee"), any such offer of employment
shall be effective as of the date that such Offer-and-Acceptance Employee
presents himself or herself to Purchaser for active employment; _provided_
that such date occurs within twelve (12) months of the Applicable Closing
Date. For all purposes of the remainder of this _Article VI_ , with respect to
any Inactive Employee, the date that such Inactive Employee commences
employment with Purchaser or the time of such commencement of employment shall
be substituted for the terms "Applicable Closing Date" or "applicable
Closing", respectively, wherever such term appears. Each Employee who (1) is
an ARD Employee, (2) accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser and
commences employment with Purchaser or an affiliate or (3) is an employee of a
Transferred Subsidiary is referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee" as
of the Applicable Closing Date. Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Applicable
Closing Date, Sellers shall terminate the employment of all Offer-and-
Acceptance Employees. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation or
guarantee by Sellers that any particular Offer-and-Acceptance Employee shall
accept Purchasers offer of employment or that any particular Offer-and-
Acceptance Employee shall continue in employment with Purchaser or its
affiliates following the applicable Closing.

(b) All offers of employment by Purchaser to the Offer-and-Acceptance
Employees shall be in the same position and (in the case of the Offer-and-
Acceptance Employees whose principal place of employment is on an Assumed
Lease Real Property or real property subject to the Saluggia Leases) location
as provided by Sellers immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date and
shall be consistent with this _Article VI_ (including without limitation
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_). Purchaser and its affiliates shall comply with
all applicable Laws and any applicable Collective Agreements relating to the
offers of employment to Offer-and-Acceptance Employees, and continuation of
employment of the Transferred Employees on and after the applicable Closing.

(c) Sellers and Purchaser will and will procure that their
respective subsidiaries comply with their obligations under the ARD in
relation to the ARD Employees.

(d) Sellers and Purchaser will and will procure that their respective
subsidiaries use reasonable best efforts to procure that the contract of
employment of each ARD Employee (excluding terms relating to a provision of an
occupational pension scheme insofar as they relate to benefits for old
age, invalidity or survivors) will have effect on the applicable Closing as
if originally made between the ARD Employee and Purchaser or, as appropriate,
one of its subsidiaries.

 

(e) Sellers and Purchaser will and will procure that their respective
subsidiaries give effect to the ARD in respect of the ARD Employees whether
or not, in the absence of this provision, the ARD would otherwise apply.

(f) Purchaser will cooperate to provide and will procure that its
subsidiaries cooperate to provide Sellers with all information reasonably
required by Sellers or their respective subsidiaries in order to enable
Sellers and their respective subsidiaries to comply with their obligations to
inform and consult with any elected representatives or labor union that
represents or has consultation rights in respect of any ARD Employee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



55 (g) Purchaser and its subsidiaries shall assume and be solely responsible for
all employment related claims arising out of its failure to comply with their
obligations under the ARD.

(h) Prior to the Applicable Closing Date, Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts to satisfy all pre-Closing legal or contractual requirements to
provide notice to, or to enter into any consultation procedure with, any labor
union, labor organization or works council that is representing any Employee,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the legal or contractual information and/or consultation
requirements with respect to Employees located in France or their
representatives, as the case may be, shall in no circumstance prevent, delay
or impede the Closing in respect of any jurisdiction outside of France.

 

Section 6.02 _S_ _eller Benefit Plans_. Unless otherwise provided under the
terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plan or the Transition Services
Agreement, effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Applicable Closing Date, each
Employee shall cease all active participation in and accrual of benefits under
the Employee Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans (such Employee
Benefit Plans, along with any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy or arrangement at any time sponsored, maintained, contributed to or
required to be contributed to by any of the Sellers, the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, the "Retained
Benefit Plans"). The Assumed Benefit Plans are set forth in _Section 6.02_ of
the Disclosure Schedule). Sellers and their affiliates (other than any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain or assume all liabilities and
obligations under or with respect to the Retained Benefit Plans, whether
arising before, on or after the Applicable Closing Date (such liabilities and
obligations shall be deemed Retained Liabilities for all purposes under this
Agreement notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement), and neither
Purchaser nor any of its affiliates (including, after the Applicable Closing
Date, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall sponsor, contribute to or
maintain, or have any liability with respect to, any of the Retained Benefit
Plans, other than the Purchaser Retention Payment described in _Section_ __ _
6.11_ hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) any
employee or former employee working in the Business who (i) as of the
Applicable Closing Date is receiving or eligible to receive short-term
disability benefits under a Retained Benefit Plan, or (ii) as of
the Applicable Closing Date is receiving or is in an eligibility waiting or
exclusion period for purposes of receiving long-term disability benefits under
a Retained Benefit Plan, shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as
applicable, to receive such benefits under a Retained Benefit Plan and (b)
Sellers and their affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) will
assume or retain any obligations under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, or similar state Law ("COBRA") with respect
to employees and any other qualified beneficiaries (i) who are enrolled in
COBRA continuation coverage under a Retained Benefit Plan as of the Applicable
Closing Date, or (ii) with respect to whom a COBRA qualifying event occurred
on or prior to the Applicable Closing Date. Following the Applicable Closing
Date, each Transferred Employee shall be permitted to elect to take
distribution (subject to applicable Law) of his or her vested accounts under
any Retained Benefit Plan that is a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution
plan and, if a Transferred Employee so elects, to roll them over, directly or
otherwise, in accordance with applicable Law, to an individual retirement
account or to a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan
established or maintained by Purchaser or a Transferred Subsidiary
(the "Buyer U.S. Defined Contribution Plans"), and Purchaser and Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate to facilitate the direct rollover of distributions,
including loan balances, to the Buyer U.S. Defined Contribution Plans where
elected by the Transferred Employee. Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the
Applicable Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume or a Transferred Subsidiary
shall retain (as applicable) and honor in accordance with their terms the
Assumed Benefit Plans and shall be solely responsible for all liabilities
under the Assumed Benefit Plans, whether arising before, on or after the
applicable Closing (such liabilities and obligations shall be Assumed
Liabilities for all purposes under this Agreement), and Sellers shall not
sponsor, contribute to or maintain, or have any liability with respect to, the
Assumed Benefit Plans.

 



56 Section 6.03 _Comparability_. Without prejudice to the terms of  _Section_ __
_ 6.01(c)_ to (h) for a period of not less than one year following the
Applicable Closing Date (the "Benefit Period"), Purchaser shall provide each
Transferred Employee with (a) annual base salary or wages and short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the annual base salary, wages and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Applicable Closing Date, (b) employee benefits (other than any
retention, change in control or transaction bonuses or equity or equity-based
compensation or benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to such benefits provided to such Transferred Employee under the existing
terms of the Employee Benefit Plans set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.17(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule; provided that, unless otherwise required by
applicable non-U.S. Law, nothing herein shall require Purchaser to establish
any defined benefit pension plan, non-qualified deferred compensation plan or
post-employment health or welfare plan and Purchaser may instead, with
respect to any defined benefit pension plan, non-qualified deferred
compensation plan or post-employment health or welfare plan provided prior to
the Closing and taken into account for purposes of this covenant, provide for
such benefits pursuant to an analogous but different form of benefit plan
(including, without limitation, by means of an enhanced matching contribution
with respect to a defined contribution retirement plan or participation in a
health savings account or similar program)) and (c) any other material terms
and conditions of employment that are substantially similar in the aggregate
as were provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Applicable Closing Date.

Section 6.04 _S_ _everance_. Sellers or their affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain or assume and be solely responsible
for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its affiliates
(including, after the Applicable Closing Date, the Transferred Subsidiaries)
from, all Liabilities that may result in respect of claims for statutory,
contractual or common law severance or other separation benefits or other
legally mandated payment obligations (including claims for wrongful dismissal,
notice of termination of employment or pay in lieu of notice, plus any
payment under the CRM Retention Bonus Program and any retention, change in
control or transaction bonuses or equity or equity-based compensation or
benefits), together with the employer-paid portion of any employment or
payroll taxes related thereto, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with (a) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (b) an Employees rejection of Purchasers offer of employment, other
than any such Liability (which shall be assumed by Purchaser) arising from (i)
Purchasers failure to offer employment to or continue the employment of any
Employee on terms consistent with this _Article VI_ and in accordance with
applicable Law or (ii) Purchasers termination of employment of any
Transferred Employee after 12:01 a.m. on the Applicable Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ and without prejudice to the
terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)_ to (h), with respect to any Transferred
Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser during the Benefit
Period, Purchaser shall provide such Transferred Employee with the cash
severance benefits such Transferred Employee would have received if he or she
separated from Sellers immediately prior to the applicable Closing under the
applicable Employee Benefit Plan set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.17(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule that is designated as a severance plan or severance
policy; provided, however, that for purposes of this covenant and Purchasers
severance plans, such Transferred Employee shall be credited for service with
Sellers as described in _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ and for service with Purchaser
following the Applicable Closing Date.

 

Section 6.05 _Service Credit_. From and after the Applicable Closing Date,
Purchaser shall give or cause to be given to each Transferred Employee credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, level of severance or
vacation/paid time off benefits, and for any other purpose as may be required
under applicable Law, under each employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement

 



57  established or maintained by Purchaser under which Transferred Employees are
eligible to participate for service on or prior to the applicable Closing with
Sellers or any predecessor thereof to the same extent and for the same
purpose that such credit was recognized by Sellers under the comparable
Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the applicable Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that such credit need not be provided to the extent that such
credit would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

Section 6.06 _Pre-Existing Conditions/Copayment Credit_. With respect to each
group health benefit plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Purchaser
after the Applicable Closing Date (collectively, the "Purchaser Welfare
Benefit Plans") in which any Transferred Employee or spouse or dependent
thereof may be eligible to participate, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) waive, or cause its affiliates or insurance carrier
to waive, all limitations as to preexisting conditions, actively-at-work
requirements, exclusions and waiting periods, if any, with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Transferred
Employee or spouse or dependent thereof, and any other restrictions that would
prevent immediate or full participation by such Transferred Employee or spouse
or dependent thereof, under such Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan, to the same
extent and for the same purpose as satisfied or waived for such person under a
comparable Employee Benefit Plan, and (b) provide or cause its affiliates to
provide full credit to each Transferred Employee or spouse or dependent
thereof for any co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses and for
any lifetime maximums paid by such Transferred Employee or spouse or
dependent thereof under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan during the plan
year in which the Applicable Closing Date occurs up to and including the
Applicable Closing Date as if such amounts had been paid under such Purchaser
Welfare Benefit Plan.

Section 6.07 _V_ _acation_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and
subject to any required consents, Purchaser shall assume or cause its
affiliate to assume and/or honor all vacation or annual leave days accrued or
earned but not yet taken by such Transferred Employee as of the Applicable
Closing Date to the extent such amounts are reflected as Current Liabilities
in the calculation of Net Working Capital (and otherwise such amounts are to
be borne by the Sellers). To the extent that a Transferred Employee is
entitled under any applicable Law or any policy of Sellers to be paid for any
vacation or annual leave days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such
Transferred Employee as of the Applicable Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely
discharge the liability for such vacation or annual leave days in accordance
with applicable Law to the extent such amounts are reflected as Current
Liabilities in the calculation of Net Working Capital (and otherwise such
amounts are to be borne by the Sellers).

 

Section 6.08 _Allocation of Employment Liabilities_. Subject to the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)_ to (h), Sellers shall retain responsibility for all
employment and employee-benefit-related liabilities that relate to (a) the
Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Employee) that arise as a
result of an event or events that occurred prior to 12:01 a.m. on the
Applicable Closing Date and (b) any other current or former employee of
Sellers or their affiliates who are not Transferred Employees that arise as a
result of an event or events that occurred or occur at any time. Effective as
of 12:01 a.m. on the Applicable Closing Date, Purchaser or its applicable
affiliate shall be solely responsible for all employment and employee-benefits
related liabilities that relate to the Transferred Employees (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that arise as a result of an
event or events that occurred on or after 12:01 a.m. on the Applicable Closing
Date.

 

Section 6.09 _Collective Agreements_. Purchaser agrees to take all actions in
each case that are legally required to be taken by Purchaser or an affiliate
(with the selection of the entity to be determined in the sole discretion of

the applicable Transferred Subsidiary to, assume the obligation to pay to a
Transferred Employee each cash retention bonus award under the CRM Retention
Bonus Program that is payable to any Transferred Employee on the basis of
continued employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates following the
Applicable Closing Date ("Purchaser Retention Payment"). Following the Initial
Closing and promptly following receipt by LivaNova of documentation
demonstrating that any such payment has been made in accordance with the CRM
Retention Bonus Program, LivaNova shall reimburse Purchaser for one half of
each Purchaser Retention Payment ( _provided_ , that with respect to any
Purchaser Retention Payment to be made based on quarterly sales during the
calendar quarter in which the Initial Closing occurs, LivaNova shall reimburse
Purchaser for (x) 100% of the portion of the Purchaser Retention Payment
attributable to the period prior to the Initial Closing Date (determined
based on the number of calendar days that have elapsed during such calendar
quarter prior to the Initial Closing Date) and (y) 50% of the remainder of
such Purchaser Retention Payment). For the avoidance of doubt, neither
Purchaser nor any of its affiliates (including, after the Applicable Closing
Date, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall have any obligation or
liability for any amounts under the CRM Retention Bonus Program that are
payable on, or immediately following, the Applicable Closing Date.

Notwithstanding anything in this _Article VI_ to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
establishment, amendment or other modification of any Employee Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its affiliates, or
shall limit the right of Purchaser or any of its affiliates to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Assumed Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan following the Applicable Closing Date. Sellers and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Article VI_ are
included for their sole benefit, and that nothing in this _Article VI_ ,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights (a) in any other person, including any Employee, any participant in any
Employee Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its
affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (b) to continued
employment with Purchaser or any of its affiliates or to any particular term

ARTICLE VIII.

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
abandoned at any time prior to the Initial Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of LivaNova and Purchaser; or

 



61 (b) by either LivaNova or Purchaser if the Initial Closing (but for avoidance
of doubt not the Deferred Closings) does not occur on or prior to November
20, 2018 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement (or by LivaNova if the failure by any Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement) has been a substantial cause of the failure
of the Initial Closing to have occurred on or before the End Date (or any
extension thereof), (ii) Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ during the pendency of
any proceeding brought by LivaNova prior to the End Date (or any extension
thereof) for specific performance of this Agreement or (iii) LivaNova shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 8.01(b)_ during the pendency of any Proceeding brought by Purchaser prior
to the End Date (or any extension thereof) for specific performance of this
Agreement; or

 

(c) by Purchaser if LivaNova shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ or _7.02_ and
(ii) cannot be cured by LivaNova by the End Date, or if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of (x) the thirtieth day
following receipt by LivaNova of written notice of such material breach or
failure to perform from Purchaser stating Purchasers intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ and the basis for
such termination and (y) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ if Purchaser is then in breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in the conditions to the Initial Closing set forth in  _Sections
7.01_ and/or _7.03_ not being satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Initial Closing (but subject to such
conditions being capable of being satisfied as of such date)); or

 

(d) by LivaNova:

(i) if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ or _7.03_ and (y)
cannot be cured by Purchaser by the End Date, or if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured by the earlier of (A) the thirtieth day following
receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such material breach or failure to
perform from LivaNova stating LivaNovas intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_ and the basis for such termination
and (B) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that LivaNova shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)_ if LivaNova is then in breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions
to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and/or _7.02_ not being satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Initial Closing (but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied as of such date); or

(ii) if (x) Purchaser is required to consummate the Initial Closing pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and Purchaser fails to consummate the Initial Closing
by the date the Initial Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01_, (y) LivaNova has confirmed by notice to Purchaser that
all conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ have been satisfied or that
it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ and
(z) the Acquisition shall not have been consummated within one (1) Business
Day after delivery of such notice; or

(e) by either LivaNova or Purchaser, if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued any order, injunction or other decree or taken any other action, in
each case, which has become final and non-appealable and which restrains,
permanently enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Acquisition (in whole or in
part); _provided_ , _however_ , that this right of termination shall not be
available to any party whose failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of or resulted in such order, decree,
ruling or injunction.

 



62 Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination by LivaNova or Purchaser pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.01_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no
further force and effect (other than the provisions of  _Section_ __ _
5.04_, _Section_ __ _ 5.05(a)_, the indemnification provisions of _Section_
__ _ 5.11_, this _Article VIII_ and _Article XI_ , all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part
of Purchaser or LivaNova or their respective affiliates or Representatives,
except (i) as liability may exist pursuant to the Sections specified in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_ that survive such termination or (ii) for willful breach
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be deemed to include any failure by
Purchaser to consummate the Initial Closing if it is obliged to do
so hereunder or actual fraud by any such person or its affiliates).

(b) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated
as provided herein, all information received by Purchaser or its
Representatives with respect to the businesses of LivaNova and its affiliates
(including the Business) shall be treated in accordance with the

ARTICLE IX.

 

INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

 

Section 9.01 _Indemnification by_ _LivaNova_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, from and after the Initial Closing, LivaNova
shall indemnify Purchaser and its affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against any and
all Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of LivaNova
or any Seller contained in this Agreement or any Local Transfer Agreement
(disregarding any qualifications as to "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect" or other qualifications of similar purport or effect) as of the date
hereof and as of the Initial Closing Date;

(b) any breach by LivaNova of any covenant contained in this Agreement or any
Local Transfer Agreement; and

Seller to pay, perform or otherwise discharge when due and payable any
Retained Liability.

Section 9.02  _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, from and after the Initial Closing, Purchaser
shall indemnify Sellers and their respective affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnitees") from and
against any and all Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from any of the
following:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or any Local Transfer Agreement as of the date
hereof and as of the Initial Closing Date;

 



63 (b) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant contained in this Agreement or any
Local Transfer Agreement; and

(c) any Assumed Liability, including the failure of Purchaser or any of its
affiliates to pay, perform or otherwise discharge when due and payable any
Assumed Liability, or any Liability of a Transferred Subsidiary that is not a
Retained Liability.

 

Section 9.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) If any party (the "Indemnified Party") receives written notice (or
otherwise becomes aware) of the commencement of any Proceeding or the
assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or
assessment (in each case other than any claims, penalties, assessments or
other proceedings with respect to Taxes, which for the avoidance of doubt
shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 10.04_) for which indemnity may be
sought under _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ (a "Third Party
Claim"), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but no later than
fifteen (15) calendar days of the earlier of receiving such written notice or
becoming aware of such Third Party Claim) provide the other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating
the nature, basis, the amount thereof (to the extent known or of a nature that
can reasonably be estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of such Third Party Claim), the method of computation thereof (to
the extent known or of a nature that can reasonably be estimated), any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto,
and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto,
along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim
and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof
at its expense (provided that the amount of such expense shall be a liability
of the Indemnifying Party hereunder subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.05_) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if it gives notice to the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) calendar days (or such lesser number of
days set forth in the notice as may be required by the relevant Proceeding
applicable to such Third Party Claim) from receipt of any such notice of a
Third Party Claim; _provided_ that, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume or maintain the control of the defense of any Third Party
Claim (A) if such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding action, indictment, allegation or investigation or any
regulatory matter brought by a Governmental Entity, (B) the plaintiff seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (C) any
insurance carrier for the Indemnified Party requires as a condition to the
Indemnified Partys eligibility to recover insurance proceeds on account of
such Third Party Claim that such carrier control the defense of such Third
Party Claim, or (D) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded,
based on the advice of counsel, that there is an actual or likely conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim.

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party (A) does not (or is not entitled to) assume
such defense, or (B) after assuming such defense, fails to take reasonable
steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within twenty (20)
calendar days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party
of the failure of the Indemnifying Party to take such reasonable steps and
describing in reasonable detail such failure, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to assume its own defense;

 



64   _provided_ that, any acts or omissions by the Indemnifying Party in the
exercise of its reasonable judgment in defending against such Third Party
Claim shall not constitute such a failure; it being understood that the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not
be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnified Party assumes its own defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise, or consent to the entry of any
judgment, in respect of, such Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (w) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in (but not control) the defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings of the Third Party Claim (provided that, in the event the
Indemnified Party, with the advice of counsel, reasonably determines that
there is a conflict of interests that makes it inappropriate for a single
counsel to represent all parties under applicable standards of legal ethics,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for legal expenses
(subject to the other limitations set forth herein) reasonably incurred in
respect of its own counsel), (x) the Indemnified Party will not admit any
liability, file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement agreement, compromise or discharge with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and such
consent shall not be considered "unreasonably withheld" if (A) such settlement
contains any admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Indemnifying Party
and (B) such settlement imposes any sanctions, restrictions or obligations on
the Indemnifying Party), (y) the Indemnifying Party will not admit to any
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and (z) the Indemnifying Party agrees to
keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed regarding the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim and to consider in good faith any
suggestions made by the Indemnified Party regarding the defense or settlement
of such Third Party Claim.

 

(v) The Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to settle any Third Party
Claim except if such settlement is consented to by the Indemnified Party in
writing, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
(and such consent shall not be considered "unreasonably withheld" if (A) such
settlement contains any admission of liability or wrongdoing by the
Indemnified Party, (B) such settlement imposes any sanctions, restrictions or
obligations on the Indemnified Party, except for monetary damages for which
the Indemnifying Party is solely responsible, or (C) such settlement does not
contain a full release of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim). The parties will act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense with respect to a Third
Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment
that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(vi) The parties will also cooperate in any such defense, appeal or
settlement proceedings, give each other reasonable access to all business
records, employees and other documents and information relevant thereto and
use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law) and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to
be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges.

(b) [Reserved]

 



65 Section 9.04 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement (other than Specified Indemnification Representations) and the
Local Transfer Agreements shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect on the fifteen-month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date and the
Specified Indemnification Representations shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect sixty (60) calendar days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the
Specified Indemnification Representations) shall survive for three (3) years
after the Initial Closing Date with respect to the Licensed Mark (as defined
in the Trademark License Agreement), Trademark License Agreement, and use of
the Licensed Mark thereunder. The applicable expiration date referred to in
the preceding to sentences is the "Expiration Date." No claim for
indemnification hereunder for breach of any representation or warranty may be
made after the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
prior to the Expiration Date any Indemnitee delivers a written notice in
conformity with _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_, then the claim for indemnification
asserted in such notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved.

Section 9.05  _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification, for
aggregate Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_ in excess of $14,250,000
(the "Cap") and no Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification
for aggregate Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a))_ in excess of the
Cap; _provided_ that the foregoing Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising
from any inacurracy or breach of any Specified Indemnification
Representation or in the case of fraud;

(b) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for a
Loss pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(_a), (x) if with respect to any
individual item of Loss or series of related Losses, such item is less than
$100,000 (the "Minimum Amount"), and (y) unless and until the aggregate
Losses (excluding individual Losses or related Losses less than the Minimum
Amount) subject to such indemnification collectively exceed $1,900,000 (the
"Deductible"), whereupon such indemnification shall be made by LivaNova only
with respect to the amount of such Losses of Purchaser Indemnitee (excluding
individual Losses or related Losses less than the Minimum Amount) in excess of
the Deductible, provided that the foregoing Minimum Amount and foregoing
Deductible shall in each case not apply to Losses arising from any inacurracy
or breach of any Specified Indemnification Representations or in the case of
fraud; and

 

(c) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any right to assert any claims, or be
entitled to any indemnification, with respect to any Losses arising from any
conditions of contamination discovered as a result of a Phase II or other
intrusive environmental sampling, testing or investigation undertaken on or
after the Initial Closing Date by or on behalf of, or with the consent or
approval of, a Purchaser Indemnitee at or relating to any of the Real
Property; provided that, a Purchaser Indemnitee shall have the right to assert
such claims and shall be entitled to indemnification if any such Phase II or
other intrusive environmental sampling, testing or investigation (i) was
undertaken in connection with a geotechnical investigation associated with the
construction or expansion of a building or other improvements, (ii) was
undertaken to address a threat to human health or the environment, (iii) was
required by applicable Law, or (iv) was undertaken in response to a
requirement, demand or claim by a Governmental Entity or other Person, which
requirement, demand or claim was not directly or indirectly solicited or
deliberately initiated by a Purchaser Indemnitee.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for aggregate Losses pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(a)_ in excess of the Purchase Price, except in the
case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_ (as qualified
by the Disclosure Schedule) or the Local Transfer Agreements.

 



66 Section 9.06 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ or _Article X_ shall be (i) net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party (including under insurance policies) with
respect to such Loss, and (ii) solely with respect to Losses relating to a
Transferred Subsidiary, reduced (but not below zero) by any Tax Benefits
recognized by the Indemnified Party as a result of any Loss in any taxable
year in which or prior to the taxable year in which such Loss was incurred.
For this purpose, a "Tax Benefit" attributable to a Loss with respect to any
taxable year shall mean the amount by which the Indemnified Partys cumulative
liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding any
deductions attributable to the Loss, exceeds the Indemnified Partys
actual cumulative liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by
taking into account any deductions attributable to the Loss (and not
previously utilized), to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law and
treating such deductions as the last items claimed for any such taxable
year).

(b) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of Losses that are the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Losses have been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (A) (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses plus (ii) the amount received by
the Indemnified Party in respect thereof minus (B) the full amount of the
Losses. In the event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third
party with respect to any occurrence, claim or loss that results in a payment
by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ , such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment. Without
limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party
shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein,
and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

(c) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries to, take
all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss indemnifiable hereunder (other than
with respect to Taxes) upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss. No party shall be entitled to
any payment, adjustment or indemnification more than once with respect to the
same matter.

Section 9.07 _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to the matters covered by
_Section_ __ _ 2.04 _or with respect to the remedies contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 11.15_, from and after the Initial Closing, Purchasers and
Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for money damages with respect to any and
all claims relating to this Agreement, the Business, the Transferred Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred Shares or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or _Article X_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Sellers hereby waives, from and after
the Initial Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action whether
based on warranty, in contract, in tort (including negligence or strict
liability) or otherwise that Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnitee may
have against any Seller, or that any of the Sellers or any other Seller
Indemnitees may have against any member of the Purchaser Group or in each
case, any of their respective affiliates or any other person, arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_,  _Section_ __ _
11.15_, and the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or
_Article X_. Nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_ limits the rights
that may be available to Purchaser under any Ancillary Agreements.

Section 9.08 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Sellers agree to treat any indemnity payment under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01  _Tax Covenants_.

(a) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price, the assumption by
Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities (and all other capitalized costs and
relevant items as required by applicable Law) shall be allocated among the
Transferred Shares and Transferred Assets in accordance with an allocation
schedule (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). LivaNova shall deliver the
Purchase Price Allocation to Purchaser within thirty (30) calendar days
following the date in which the Adjustment Amount is finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, for Purchasers review, comment and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed. Purchaser and LivaNova shall work together in good faith to resolve
any disputes regarding the Purchase Price Allocation within ten (10) Business
Days following the delivery thereof. If Purchaser and LivaNova are unable to
resolve any such dispute, Purchaser and LivaNova shall submit the Purchase
Price Allocation to an internationally recognized independent accounting
firm (which accounting firm shall not be Ernst and Young or KPMG), mutually
agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and LivaNova, for resolution, and the
decision of such accounting firm shall be final. The costs of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by LivaNova and Purchaser. If the Purchase Price
is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the Purchase Price
Allocation shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_. Purchaser and the Sellers shall file all Tax
Returns consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation as finally determined
hereunder. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take any Tax position, whether
on a Tax Return, in an audit or otherwise, that is inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation as finally determined hereunder, and neither
Purchaser nor the Sellers shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Purchase Price Allocation by any Taxing Authority without first giving the
other parties prior written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall require Purchaser or Sellers to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority
challenging the Purchase Price Allocation.

(b) _Transfer Taxes and Apportioned Obligations_.

 

(i) Purchaser shall and LivaNova shall, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as may be required in connection with payment of any Transfer Taxes.
LivaNova shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (as applicable), or
Purchaser, as applicable, shall execute and deliver all instruments and
certificates necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing
requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

(ii) Each of LivaNova and Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall pay, one-
half of all Transfer Taxes arising in connection with the Restructuring (other
than any Transfer Taxes in connection with Steps 1(b), 1(c), 1(e), and 1(k)
of Section 1 of the Restructuring Plan, which shall be LivaNovas sole
responsibility) or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If either such party or any of its affiliates is required
by applicable Law to pay any such Transfer Taxes, then the other party shall
pay to such party or its applicable affiliate, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, one-half of the amount of such Transfer Taxes at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the due date thereof.

(iii) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied with respect to the Transferred Assets for any Straddle
Period (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on
the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the number of days included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Sellers
shall be liable for the 

 



68  proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. For purposes
of determining the amount of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations of any Transferred Subsidiary that is payable
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax Period shall be based on principles
consistent with the preceding sentence. The amount of Income Taxes (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes based on or measured by income,
activities, events, gain, proceeds, profits, receipts or similar items) of any
Transferred Subsidiary that is payable with respect to any Straddle Period,
shall be determined and apportioned as though the taxable year of the
Transferred Subsidiary terminated at the close of business on the Applicable
Closing Date.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees to retain all records relating to Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiaries and with respect to the Transferred Assets for all
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Initial Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation (including any extensions
thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which such records relate.
Purchaser and LivaNova agree to provide each other with such information and
assistance as is reasonably necessary, including access to records and
personnel, for the preparation of any Tax Returns or for the defense of any
Tax claim or assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise;
_provided that_ with respect to any Combined Tax Return, LivaNova may redact
from such Tax Returns information to the extent such information is not
primarily related to the Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries.

Section 10.02 _Tax Filings and Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Combined Tax Returns_. LivaNova (or its subsidiaries) shall, at their
sole cost and expense, prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) all combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Returns for all Tax
periods ending on or before the Applicable Closing Date that include, on the
one hand, a Transferred Subsidiary and, on the other hand, LivaNova or any of
its affiliates other than a Transferred Subsidiary, a "Combined Tax Return").
At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to filing any such Combined Tax
Return, and to the extent any such Combined Tax Return relates to
any Transferred Subsidiary, the Transferred Assets, or the Business, LivaNova
shall submit a copy of such Combined Tax Return (or relevant portions thereof)
to Purchaser for Purchasers review and approval ( _provided_ that LivaNova
may redact from such Tax Returns (or portions thereof) information to the
extent such information is not primarily related to the Business or the
Transferred Subsidiaries), and shall incorporate Purchasers reasonable
comments submitted to LivaNova no less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due date of such Combined Tax Return. In the case of any Transferred
Subsidiary included on any such Combined Tax Return, the income of any such
Transferred Subsidiary shall be included on the Combined Tax Return filed by
LivaNova pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ for all Tax periods (or
portions thereof) through the Applicable Closing Date and LivaNova shall be
responsible for all Taxes payable with respect to such Combined Tax Returns.

(b) _Tax Returns Due On Or Prior to Closing_. LivaNova (or its subsidiaries)
shall, at LivaNovas sole cost and expense, prepare and timely file (or cause
to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns (other than Combined Tax
Returns addressed in _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_) of the Transferred
Subsidiaries that are due on or prior to the Applicable Closing Date. If
LivaNova has not paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority the amount shown as
due on any such Tax Return, then no later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date (taking into account extensions) of each such Tax Return,
LivaNova shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Purchaser, all Taxes shown as due thereon to
the extent such Taxes are attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and were
not included in the determination of Net Working Capital as finally determined
hereunder, and Purchaser shall cause to be paid to the appropriate Taxing
Authority all such amounts paid to Purchaser in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating

 



69  items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Transferred Subsidiary with respect to such items, except as required by
applicable Law. At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to filing any such
Tax Return in respect of Income Taxes, LivaNova shall submit a copy of such
Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchasers review and comment, and shall
incorporate Purchasers reasonable comments submitted to LivaNova no less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return.

(c) _Tax Returns Due After Closing_. Purchaser (or its subsidiaries) shall,
at their sole cost and expense, prepare and timely file (or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns (other than Combined Tax Returns
addressed in  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ and Tax Returns addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_) in respect of the Transferred Subsidiaries that
relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods that are required to be
filed (taking into account any applicable extension) after the Applicable
Closing Date and LivaNova shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser, all Taxes shown as
due thereon to the extent such Taxes are attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and were not included in the determination of Net Working Capital as
finally determined hereunder. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating
items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Transferred Subsidiary with respect to such items, except as required by
applicable Law. At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to filing any such
Tax Return in respect of Income Taxes, Purchaser shall submit a copy of such
Tax Return to LivaNova for LivaNovas review and comment, and shall
incorporate LivaNovas reasonable comments submitted to Purchaser no less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Sellers
and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate to make (or to cause any of their
respective affiliates to make) any election available under Law to treat
the Applicable Closing Date as the end of a relevant Tax period.

(d) _Post-Closing Actions_. After the Initial Closing Date, none
of Purchaser, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any affiliate of Purchaser
shall, without the prior written consent of LivaNova (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), file any amended Tax Return
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or make or change any Tax election
that has retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case if such
action could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or reduction of any
Tax asset, the existence of increase of any Tax liability or that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification obligation under
_Article IX_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ of any Seller or any affiliate thereof
_._

(e) _Cooperation_. From and after the Initial Closing Date, LivaNova and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Transferred Assets or
the Business, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and, subject to _Section_ __ _
10.03(a)_, in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes, _provided_ , that, with respect to any Combined Tax
Return, LivaNova may redact from such Tax Returns information to the extent
such information is not primarily related to the Business or the Transferred
Subsidiaries. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) to, (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to properly retain and maintain such records until such time as
LivaNova and Purchaser agree that such retention and maintenance is no longer
necessary and (ii) allow the other party and its Representatives (and
Representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as such other party or any of its affiliates may deem necessary or appropriate
from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business
hours and at such other partys expense. 

 



70 (f) _Refunds and Credits_. Except with respect to (i) any Tax refunds (or
credits in lieu thereof) arising from the carryback of any Tax loss,
deduction or credit arising in or attributable to a period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Applicable Closing Date or (ii) any amounts
included as a Tax asset in the determination of Net Working Capital as
finally determined hereunder, any refund (or credit in lieu thereof) of Taxes
relating to the Business, the Transferred Subsidiaries or Transferred Assets
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or other Taxes which Sellers have paid or
borne, including under _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, _Section_ __ _ 10.03_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or through inclusion in the determination of Net
Working Capital as finally determined hereunder) in each case, net of any
Taxes (including withholding Taxes) and reasonable expenses attributable to
such refund or credit borne by Purchaser or its affiliates, shall be for the
account of Sellers. Any other refund (or credit in lieu thereof) of Taxes
(including any refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) arising from the carryback
of any Tax loss, deduction or credit arising in a period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Initial Closing Date) relating to the Transferred
Subsidiaries or Transferred Assets shall be for the account of Purchaser.
Purchaser shall, if LivaNova reasonably so requests, and at LivaNovas sole
cost and expense, file for and obtain or cause the Transferred Subsidiaries
or other applicable affiliates of Purchaser to file for and obtain any refunds
(or credits in lieu thereof) to which Sellers are entitled under this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(f)_. Purchaser shall pay to LivaNova by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
LivaNova the amount of any refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) to
which Seller is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(f)_ no later
than ten (10) calendar days after such refund is received or credit is
utilized on a Tax Return filed by Purchaser, a Transferred Subsidiary or
any affiliate thereof. In the event that Purchaser, any Transferred
Subsidiary, or any affiliate thereof is required to repay any such refund or
credit to any Governmental Entity due to the successful challenge of such
refund or credit by such Governmental Entity, LivaNova shall repay to
Purchaser (or such Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable) an amount equal to
such refund or credit immediately upon written request therefor.

 

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Prior to the Applicable Closing Date, LivaNova
shall cause any Tax sharing agreements and arrangements with respect to which
any Transferred Subsidiary is a party (or that otherwise relates to the
Transferred Assets or the Business) to be terminated on or prior to the
Applicable Closing Date and after the Applicable Closing Date, no Transferred
Subsidiary shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing
agreement or arrangement.

(h) _Employment Tax Reporting Responsibility_. Purchaser and any applicable
affiliate of Purchaser hereby agree to follow the alternate procedure for
United States employment tax withholding as provided in Section 5 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320. LivaNova and each Asset Seller shall
provide to Purchaser (or its applicable affiliate) all information required to
be provided by the predecessor under such Revenue Procedure and any other
information reasonably required by Purchaser (or its applicable affiliate) in
connection with its reporting obligations thereunder. LivaNova and each Asset
Seller shall thereafter have no United States employment tax reporting
responsibilities, and Purchaser (or its applicable affiliate) and its (or its
applicable affiliates) subsidiaries shall have full United States employment
tax reporting responsibilities, in each case, for Transferred Employees
following the close of business on the Applicable Closing Date for the tax
year in which the Applicable Closing Date occurs.

(i)  _VAT_.

(i) Subject to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_, Sellers and Purchaser intend
that, so far as possible under relevant Law, none of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as a supply of goods or
services subject to any VAT and all transactions contemplated by this
agreement are not chargeable with any VAT on the part of a supplier and are
outside the scope of any applicable VAT, and Sellers and Purchaser agree to
use all reasonable efforts to secure that such treatment applies.

 



71 (ii) If LivaNova and Purchaser agree that any VAT is or becomes chargeable
with respect to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Restructuring Plan (the "Restructuring VAT"), LivaNova shall be liable for,
and shall pay, all such Restructuring VAT (which shall only be charged at the
prevailing rate and in accordance with applicable Law). If LivaNova and
Purchaser cannot agree on whether Restructuring VAT is or has become
chargeable or payable, the Sellers and Purchaser shall seek the opinion of a
mutually acceptable counsel who is qualified to opine on such matter and
shall act in accordance with such counsels opinion and the costs of such
counsel shall be shared equally by Purchaser and LivaNova. If LivaNova
determines in its reasonable discretion, exercised in good faith, that any
such Restructuring VAT paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)(ii)_ is
not recoverable under applicable Law, then LivaNova shall notify Purchaser and
Purchaser shall pay to LivaNova 50% of the amount of such Restructuring VAT
that is not recoverable under applicable Law (other than any such
unrecoverable Restructuring VAT charged in connection with Steps 1(b), 1(c),
1(e), and 1(k) of Section 1 of the Restructuring Plan, which shall be
LivaNovas sole responsibility) no later than ten (10) calendar days after
receipt of such notice. If LivaNova and Purchaser cannot agree on whether any
amount paid by LivaNova pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)(ii)_ is not
recoverable under applicable Law, LivaNova and Purchaser shall seek the
opinion of a mutually acceptable counsel who is qualified to opine on such
matter and shall act in accordance with such counsels opinion and the costs
of such counsel shall be shared equally by Purchaser and LivaNova.

(iii) If, prior to the Applicable Closing Date, LivaNova and Purchaser agree
that VAT is or has become chargeable or payable on any supply in respect of
the sale of the Transferred Shares or Transferred Assets under this Agreement,
and such applicable Seller is required to pay or account for such VAT to the
relevant Taxing Authority, then the applicable Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a properly completed and executed VAT invoice (or other valid and
customary VAT documentation) with respect to the relevant supply, promptly and
in accordance with applicable Law. Purchaser shall pay to the
applicable Seller the amount shown as due on such VAT invoice or other valid
documentation (in addition to the Purchase Price payable on the Applicable
Closing Date). If LivaNova and Purchaser cannot agree on whether VAT is or has
become chargeable or payable on any supply in respect of the sale of the
Transferred Shares or Transferred Assets under this Agreement, the Sellers and
Purchaser shall seek the opinion of a mutually acceptable counsel who is
qualified to opine on such matter and shall act in accordance with such
counsels opinion and the costs of such counsel shall be shared equally by
Purchaser and LivaNova. For the avoidance of doubt, any such VAT shall only be
charged at the prevailing rate and in accordance with applicable Law. 

(iv) If Purchaser determines in its reasonable discretion, exercised in good
faith, that any amount paid to any Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
10.02(i)(iii)_ is not recoverable under applicable Law, Purchaser shall notify
the applicable Seller and such Seller shall pay to Purchaser 50% of the amount
of such VAT that is not recoverable under applicable Law, to the extent such
amount is not included in the determination of Net Working Capital as finally
determined hereunder, no later than ten (10) calendar days after receipt of
such notice. If LivaNova and Purchaser cannot agree on whether any amount
paid to any Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)(iii)_ is not
recoverable under applicable Law, LivaNova and Purchaser shall seek the
opinion of a mutually acceptable counsel who is qualified to opine on such
matter and shall act in accordance with such counsels opinion and the costs
of such counsel shall be shared equally by Purchaser and LivaNova.

 

(v) If any party pays any VAT pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ and
after the Applicable Closing Date a relevant Taxing Authority issues a ruling
indicating that such VAT was not payable in respect of the applicable
transactions (or that VAT in an amount less than that paid by such party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ was payable with respect to the
applicable transactions), any other party that receives a refund of such
amount shall promptly (but in any case within ten (10) calendar days) remit
such refund to the party that paid such amount pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 10.02_.

 



72 (vi) If, after the Applicable Closing Date, a relevant Tax Authority issues a
ruling indicating that any Restructuring VAT was payable or that any VAT was
payable with respect to any sale of the Transferred Shares or Transferred
Assets under this Agreement, but the applicable VAT was not paid (or
insufficient VAT was paid), then such Restructuring VAT or other VAT shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_.

 

(vii) Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to secure any available exemptions from,
or reductions to, any VAT under applicable Law. No party shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party, exercise any option or right that
may be available to it under applicable Law to voluntarily qualify any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a taxable transaction for VAT
purposes or otherwise subject to any VAT. Each party agrees to provide the
other party, upon such other partys request, information relating to the
computation of any VAT described in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_.

(viii) All references to Purchaser and the Sellers in this  _Section_ __ _
10.02(i)_ shall include their respective applicable affiliates.

(j) _Post-Closing Tax Savings_. After the Applicable Closing Date and except
with respect to any amounts included as a Tax asset in the determination of
Net Working Capital as finally determined hereunder, Purchaser shall pay to
LivaNova the amount of any reduction in Tax payments of Purchaser, the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any affiliates thereof that would otherwise be
payable with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before December 31, 2022 by Purchaser, the
Transferred Subsidiaries, or any affiliate thereof and that are attributable
to any LivaNova NOLs (such amount, the "NOL Tax Benefit"). The NOL Tax Benefit
for any taxable year shall be an amount equal to the excess of (A) the
cumulative liability for Taxes of Purchaser, Transferred Subsidiaries and
affiliates thereof that would have been payable for such taxable year,
calculated by excluding all LivaNova NOLs over (B) the actual cumulative
liability for Taxes of Purchaser, Transferred Subsidiaries and affiliates
thereof through the end of such taxable year, calculated by using any LivaNova
NOLs not previously taken into account (in each case to the extent permitted
by applicable Tax law and subject to any limitations on the use of such
LivaNova NOLs). An NOL Tax Benefit shall be calculated at the time of the
filing of each relevant Tax Return for any taxable year on which such LivaNova
NOLs are utilized to reduce Taxes of Purchaser, the Transferred
Subsidiaries, or any affiliates thereof for any Post-Closing Tax Period (and
not when estimated Taxes are paid). At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior
to filing any such Tax Return, Purchaser shall provide LivaNova with written
notice of the NOL Tax Benefits calculated with respect to such Tax Return
(such notice to specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such NOL
Tax Benefit) along with supporting schedules and work papers, as determined in
good faith by Purchaser or as reasonably requested by LivaNova; _provided_ ,
that LivaNova shall bear all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
of providing such information. Purchaser and LivaNova shall work together in
good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to the amount or existence of
an NOL Tax Benefit. If Purchaser and LivaNova are unable to resolve any such
disputes, such disputes shall be resolved promptly by an internationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon in writing by
Purchaser and LivaNova. The decision of such firm shall be final. The costs of
such firm shall (i) shall be borne by LivaNova, in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of items that are successfully disputed by
Purchaser (as finally determined by such firm) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of such disputed items and (ii) shall be borne by Purchaser in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of items that are successfully
disputed by LivaNova (as finally determined by such firm) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items. Within ten (10) calendar days
after the filing of each such Tax Return for any taxable year ending on or
before December 31, 2022 in which a NOL Tax Benefit is actually realized (and
not when estimated Taxes are paid), Purchaser shall pay to LivaNova by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in
writing by LivaNova the amount of any such NOL Tax Benefit. In the event that
Purchaser, any

 



73  Transferred Subsidiary, or any affiliate thereof is required to repay the
amount of any NOL Tax Benefit to any Governmental Entity due to the successful
challenge by such Governmental Entity of the use of LivaNova NOLs, upon
Purchasers provision of documentation regarding such successful challenge
that is reasonably acceptable to LivaNova, LivaNova shall promptly repay to
Purchaser (or such Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable) an amount equal to
such NOL Tax Benefit.

Section 10.03 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Applicable Closing Date, and without duplication,
LivaNova shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from and
against any and all Losses for (i) Taxes attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Transferred Assets or the Business attributable to all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, (ii) Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries attributable
to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (iii) Taxes imposed on LivaNova or any of its
affiliates (not including the Transferred Subsidiaries) for any taxable period
except to the extent such Taxes are attributable solely to (A) Purchasers
ownership or operation of the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Transferred Assets
or the Business or (B) items of income of the Transferred Subsidiaries arising
in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (iv) any breach by LivaNova or any of its
affiliates of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _
3.14_ or of any covenant or agreement contained in _Sections 1.05_ and 
_9.06_ and this _Article_ _X_ (other than a breach by a Transferred Subsidiary
following the Applicable Closing Date), (v) Taxes of another person (other
than a Transferred Subsidiary) imposed on a Transferred Subsidiary (A) as
a transferee or successor due to transactions occurring on or prior to the
Applicable Closing, (B) as a result of contracts or agreements entered into
(other than commercial contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business the primary subject matter of which is not Taxes)on or prior to the
Applicable Closing, or (C) as a result of such Transferred Subsidiary being
included in any fiscal unity or consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or
similar group at any time prior to the Applicable Closing Date, (vi) Transfer
Taxes imposed on LivaNova pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_, (vii) all
liability for VAT imposed on LivaNova or any Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.02(i)_ and (viii) all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_) and VAT addressed in _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_)
imposed in connection with the Restructuring, in each case, to the
extent such liability for Taxes is not included in the determination of Net
Working Capital as finally determined hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, LivaNova shall not have any obligations under this _Section_ __ _
10.03(a)_ for any liability for Taxes that results from any breach of any
covenants or agreements of Purchaser or its affiliates under this Agreement.

 

(b) From and after the Applicable Closing Date, and without duplication,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and
against (i) all liability for Taxes attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
Business for all Post-Closing Tax Periods (other than any such amounts arising
as a result of a breach of the representations contained in _Sections
3.14(a)(viii)_ , _3.14(a)(ix)_ , _3.14(a)(x))_ , or _3.14(d)_ and any other
amounts that are properly indemnifiable by LivaNova pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 10.03(a)_), (ii) any breach by Purchaser or any of its affiliates of any of
any covenants or agreements in _Sections 1.05_ and _9.06_ and this _Article X_
(other than a breach by a Transferred Subsidiary on or before the Closing),
(iii) all liability for Transfer Taxes imposed on Purchaser pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ and (iv) all liability for VAT imposed on Purchaser
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall not have any obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(b)_
for any liability for Taxes that results from any breach of any covenants
or agreements of LivaNova or its affiliates under this Agreement.

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)(iii)_.

 



74 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not have any right to indemnification (i) under _Section_
__ _ 10.03(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)(iv)_ from and against any Taxes
of any person that are attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period (other
than with respect to a breach of the representations contained in _Sections
3.14(a)(viii)_ , _3.14(a)(ix)_ _3.14(a)(x)_ or _3.14(d)_ ) or (ii) under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_ due to the unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax
Period of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attributes otherwise
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(e) None of Purchaser, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any affiliate of
Purchaser shall, without the prior written consent of LivaNova (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) engage in any
transaction (other than any transactions expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or the Restructuring Plan) on the Initial
Closing Date but after the Initial Closing that is outside the ordinary
course of business.

Section 10.04 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

(a) If a party to this Agreement (the "Tax Indemnified Party") receives any

counsel to one or more members of the Seller Group (which will no longer

behalf and on behalf of its Representatives and affiliates (individually and

to consent to and waive, any claim they have or may have that Latham and Watkins
LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in
such representation and (ii) acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and
on behalf of their affiliates, including the Transferred Subsidiaries
following the Initial Closing, that, in the event that any dispute arises
after the Initial Closing between the Purchaser Group or a Transferred
Subsidiary and LivaNova or its affiliates, Latham and Watkins LLP may represent

communications, or to the files of Latham and Watkins LLP relating to its
engagement, whether or not the Initial Closing shall have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Initial Closing,
(a) LivaNova and its affiliates (and not the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be a holder
thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Latham and Watkins LLP in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only LivaNova and its
affiliates (and not the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall hold such property
rights and (c) Latham and Watkins LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Latham and Watkins LLP and any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise. In
addition, Purchaser and the Transferred Subsidiaries agree that it would be
impractical to remove all attorney-client communications from the records
(including e-mails and other electronic files) of the Transferred
Subsidiaries. Accordingly, as to any such communications prior to the Initial
Closing, Purchaser and each Transferred Subsidiary together with any of their
respective affiliates, subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that
no such person may use or rely on or access without consent any of such
communications in a manner that may be adverse to LivaNova or any of its
affiliates.

Section 11.14 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a
waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance. No course of dealing
between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this
Agreement. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by applicable Law.

Section 11.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Acquisition) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction without proof
of damages or inadequacy of legal remedy and without the posting or provision
of any bond or other security, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, without that right, neither LivaNova nor Purchaser would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law.

 

Section 11.16 _No Right of Set-Off_. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, hereby waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset,
recoupment, or similar rights that Purchaser, any of its affiliates or any of
its or their respective successors and permitted assigns has or may have with
respect to the payment of the Purchase Price or any other payments to be made
by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument
delivered by Purchaser in connection herewith.

 



93 Section 11.17 _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

 

Section 11.18 _Guarantee_.

 

(a) Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the timely
performance and observance by Purchaser of all its obligations to
be performed or observed under this Agreement prior to the Initial Closing,
including (a) all of Purchasers pre-Initial Closing payment obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, which include payment of the Purchase Price; and
(b) any money damages required to be paid by Purchaser arising from any breach
by Purchaser of its pre-Initial Closing obligations under this Agreement (such
obligations, the "Guaranteed Obligations").

(b) This guarantee is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty by Guarantor of
all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full
force and effect until the earlier of (i) all Guaranteed Obligations having
been indefeasibly performed in full and paid in cash and (ii) the Initial
Closing. Guarantor hereby waives presentment, protest, notice, dishonor or
default, demand for payment and any other notices to which Guarantor might
otherwise be entitled.

 

(c) Guarantor hereby agrees that Purchaser may, at any time and from time to
time, and without notice to the Guarantor, make any agreement with the Seller
Group for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or for any modification or amendment of the terms
thereof, all without in any way impairing, releasing, discharging or
otherwise affecting the obligations of Guarantor (provided, for the avoidance
of doubt, that the obligations of the Guarantor shall not be increased by such
agreement). Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability
or other defense of Purchaser (other than defense of payment or performance),
or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Purchaser, or
any claim that Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome than
Purchasers (in the case of any of the foregoing, other than a defense
available to Purchaser under the terms hereof) and waives the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting the liability of Guarantor hereunder. The
obligations of Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not
merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations.
