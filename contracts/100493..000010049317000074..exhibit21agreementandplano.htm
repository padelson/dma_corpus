ARTICLE 2

THE OFFER

Section 2.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Section 11.01 and nothing shall have occurred
that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate
the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the
"Offer Conditions"), as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in
no event later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer. The Offer shall be
subject to the Offer Conditions. The date on which Merger Sub commences the
Offer is referred to as the "Offer Commencement Date".

(b) Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the Offer
Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
provided that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub
shall not:

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition;

(ii) decrease the Offer Price;

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

(v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as
otherwise provided herein; or 

(vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or
other terms of the Offer in any manner that broadens such conditions or is
otherwise adverse to the holders of the Shares.

(c) The Offer shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that
is 20 business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
1934 Act) after the Offer Commencement Date (the "Expiration Date"), unless
the period of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Section (in which
event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earliest time and date that
the Offer, as so extended, may expire).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Section 11.01, (i) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period otherwise required by the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or Applicable Law and
(ii) if, on the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer
and its expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent
date for successive extension periods of up to 10 Business Days (the length of
such period not to exceed 10 Business Days to be determined by Merger Sub in
its sole discretion, subject to Applicable Law); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), in no event shall Merger
Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date; and provided further,
that in no event shall Merger Sub be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the
End Date without the prior written consent of the Company. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.01, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.

(e) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for, promptly (within
the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) of the 1934 Act) after the expiration of the
Offer, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
(the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the Offer, the
"Acceptance Time").

(f) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits
thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include the summary term sheet required
thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (and any other appropriate ancillary
documents) (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the appropriate Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company will furnish to 

Parent and Merger Sub the information relating to the Company required by the
1934 Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent will furnish to the
Company the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub required by the 1934
Act to be set forth in the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9"). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct
any information provided by it or any of its Affiliates for use in the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in
any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the
appropriate Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws or the rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, in each case
as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any written comments or other
written communications (and a summary of all substantive oral comments or
communications) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(ii) a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such comments and to
provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given).

Section 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer
and, subject to Section 7.03(b), the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Company Board Recommendation, as it may be amended, modified or withdrawn in
accordance with this Agreement. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with
a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories
and all other information in the Company's possession or control regarding the
beneficial holders of Shares, in each case true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to
whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the
"Stockholder List Date"), and of all persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Subject to the requirements of
Applicable Law, and except as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents reasonably necessary
or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose the 

information contained in any such lists, labels, listings and files, and shall
use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement

shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, shall deliver to the Company
or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control,
in each case in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Offering Documents on the Offer
Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws or any other Applicable Law, the Schedule 14D-9 that,
subject to Section 7.03(b), shall include the Company Board Recommendation,
and shall set the Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of
receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of Delaware Law. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the notice of appraisal required to be
delivered by the Company under Section 262(d) of Delaware Law at the time the
Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by
it or any of its Affiliates for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or
misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable. Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC,
and, unless the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with Section 7.03(b), the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.
Unless the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
Section 7.03(b), the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel with (i) any written comments or other written communications (and a
summary of all substantive oral comments or communications) that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable
and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with
the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

(c) The Company shall register (and shall cause its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub effective
immediately after the Acceptance Time.

ARTICLE 3

THE MERGER

Section 3.01. The Merger. (a) As soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in
accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall 

cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law
and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the
Offer without a vote on the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 3.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b), Section 3.02(c) or
Section 3.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.03.

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares in an
Employee Plan of the Company) immediately prior to the Effective Time and each
Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub as of the commencement of the Offer, shall
be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each Share owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or
Parent (other than Merger Sub) at the commencement of the Offer, if any, shall
be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation
such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation 

immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
(except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares pursuant
to Section 3.02(c)).

Section 3.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a United States bank and trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for
the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") or (ii)uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares").
The Company and Parent shall enter into a Paying Agent agreement with the
Paying Agent which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and
obligations of the Paying Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement
and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. Promptly after
the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to the
Paying Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, in the aggregate, in an amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying
Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash, the "Consideration Fund").
In addition, Parent shall make available as necessary cash in an amount
sufficient for payment of any dividends or distributions declared, but not
paid, by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time in respect of the Shares in
accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (including on account of any
Merger Consideration returned to Parent pursuant to Section 3.03(g)), Parent
shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the
Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make
such payments. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Paying Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter
of transmittal and instructions in customary form (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange, the form and substance
of such letter of transmittal and instructions shall be reasonably agreed to
by Parent and the Company and prepared prior to the Closing.

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration 

payable for each Share represented by such Certificate or for each such
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Shares.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) The cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent; provided, however, that any such investments shall be
in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than
30 days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in excess of
the amounts payable to the Company's former stockholders shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and shall be paid as Parent directs. No
investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by
this Article 3, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Company's stockholders at the Effective Time in the amount of
such losses to the extent the funds in the Consideration Fund are insufficient
for such purposes, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Consideration Fund.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become 

property of any Governmental Authority) shall become to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

Section 3.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of Delaware Law,
unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of Delaware Law, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted pursuant to Section 3.02(a) as of the Effective Time into, and shall
represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.03. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and any withdrawals of any
such demands, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to
settle or settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.05. Company Stock Awards. (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each option (or portion thereof) to acquire Shares granted or
issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Stock Options") shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive, at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such
canceled Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted Share unit
granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company RSUs")
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, at or promptly
after the Effective Time, solely an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company RSU.

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted Share
granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time 

(collectively, the "Company Restricted Shares" and, together with Company
Stock Options and Company RSUs, "Company Stock Awards") shall be converted
into the right to receive, at or promptly after the Effective Time, solely an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the treatment of Company Stock Awards as
contemplated in this Section 3.05 (including obtaining any required consents
from holders of Company Stock Awards).

Section 3.06. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate any Company employee stock purchase plan (each, an
"ESPP") and all outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing; provided that
from and after the date hereof, the Company shall (a) take all actions
necessary to ensure that (i) no new participants are permitted to participate
in the ESPPs and that participants may not increase their payroll deductions
or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
except for the offering or purchase period under the ESPPs that is in effect
on the date hereof (the "Final Offering Period"), no offering or purchase
period shall be authorized, continued or commenced following the date hereof
and (b) provide notice to participants describing the treatment of the ESPPs
pursuant to this Section 3.06. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final
Offering Period, the Final Offering Period shall terminate no later than the
day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall cause the
exercise date applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur
on such termination date with respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) all amounts allocated to
each participant's account under the ESPPs at the end of the Final Offering
Period shall thereupon be used to purchase whole Shares under the terms of the
ESPPs for such offering period, which Shares shall be canceled at the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 3.02(a), and (B) as promptly as practicable
following the purchase of Shares in accordance with the foregoing clause (A),
return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such
participant's account after such purchase.

Section 3.07. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares) shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding
any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the
date hereof to purchase Shares granted under the Company's stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements), the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted. 

Nothing in this Section 3.07 shall be construed to permit any party to take
any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision
of this Agreement.

Section 3.08. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Applicable Law. If the Paying Agent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying
Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

Section 3.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.

gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service Provider, including under
Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

right under, or acceleration of any obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any provision of any Contract or Permit affecting binding on
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which they or any their respective

release in response to any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification

(E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9

acquisition agreement, option agreement or other Contract relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on
the Company set forth in this Section by any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section by the Company.

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 7.03(a), at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time:

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions including, as a part thereof, making any
counterproposal) with any Third Party and its Representatives that has made
after the date of this Agreement a written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of Section 7.03 and that the Board of Directors
reasonably believes, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
independent financial advisor, is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party, its Representatives and
its potential sources of financing non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a
copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent)
with such Third Party and/or such other Persons with terms no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided
that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available
to Parent, as the case may be, promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
following the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party and/or
such other Persons); and

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 7.03(e), the Board of Directors may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) in connection with a Superior
Proposal or (B) in response to material events, changes or developments in
circumstances that were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of
Directors as of or prior to the date hereof and becomes known to the Board of
Directors after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (an

generally affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, (C) acts of war, sabotage or terrorism or natural disasters involving

exceeding any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or

or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(c) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; provided,
that any such disclosure referred to in clause (i) or (ii) that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (x) the Board of Directors expressly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure or (y) such disclosure is a "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(b) promulgated under the 1934 Act; provided, further, that this Section
7.03(c) shall not be deemed to permit the Board of Directors to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change except, in each case, to the extent permitted by
Section 7.03(e).

(d) Required Notices. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with any such Acquisition Proposal (or for the purpose of facilitating the
submission of an Acquisition Proposal) or request for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by any Third Party that has made an Acquisition Proposal or that has made such
request for the purpose of facilitating the submission of an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and
shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions
of, any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials
sent by or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives that describes the material terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral
communications addressing such matters). Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Company's compliance with this Section 7.03(d).

(e) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(i), unless (i) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least five
Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so, specifying
in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
such termination, attaching (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change to be made in connection with a Superior Proposal or a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i), the most current version of
the proposed agreement under which a Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the third party making the Acquisition
Proposal, or (B) in the case of an Adverse 

Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that Parent proposes and
has not withdrawn in response to such Superior Proposal and that would be
binding on Parent if accepted by the Company and (iii) following the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in
consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor,
and giving due consideration to such revisions proposed by Parent, that (A) in
the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in connection with a
Superior Proposal or a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(i), such Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal (assuming such revisions proposed by Parent were to be
given effect) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new three Business
Day period under this Section 7.03(e)) and (B) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, obviates
the need for such recommendation change, and in either case, the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(f) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any written Acquisition Proposal (substituting the term "50%"
for the term "15%" in each instance where such term appears therein) that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more
favorable to the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking
into account any revisions proposed by Parent and not withdrawn to amend the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(e)), which the Board of
Directors determines is reasonably likely to be consummated without undue
delay relative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for
which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then
fully committed by a reputable financing source or reasonably determined to be
available by the Board of Directors.

(g) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources and shall promptly request that each
such Third Party, if any, shall promptly return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by
or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that
information). If received by the Company, the Company shall provide to Parent
all certifications of such return or destruction from such other Persons as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. 

Section 7.04. Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each
Compensation Arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof to be approved as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the 1934 Act.

Section 7.05. Treatment of Credit Facilities and Notes.

(a) From the date hereof through the Effective Time, at Parent's written

(x) the optional redemption, defeasance or other repurchase by Parent (on
behalf of the Company) or any of Parent's Subsidiaries of, or a tender offer
by Parent (on behalf of the Company) or any of Parent's Subsidiaries for, some
or all of the Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture (and in connection
therewith, obtaining the release of all guarantees with respect thereto),
provided that (i) any documentation relating to any such redemption,
defeasance, repurchase or tender offer (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) and all material requested to be published or mailed to
the holders of the Notes shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment
by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii) the consummation
of any such redemption, defeasance, repurchase or tender offer shall be

to deliver any legal opinions in connection with any such redemption,
defeasance, repurchase or tender offer for the Notes or the execution by the
trustee under the Indenture of any supplemental indenture or other instrument,
(iv) no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Closing (it being understood that this clause (iv) shall not apply to one or
more customary officers' certificates delivered to the trustee as required
under the Indenture as a condition to giving a redemption or repurchase
notice), (v) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay any
commitment or other fee, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any
payment in connection with any such redemption, defeasance, repurchase 

or tender offer prior to the Closing (except to the extent that Parent
promptly reimburses the Company or such Subsidiary therefor), and (vi) the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to incur any other
liability in connection with any such redemption, defeasance, repurchase or

not otherwise indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, and (y) the repayment or
prepayment by Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries of any amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facilities on or after the Acceptance Time (and
in connection therewith, obtaining the termination of all commitments under
and the release of all guarantees and liens with respect thereto), provided
that (i) any documentation relating to any such repayment or prepayment
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) shall be subject to the
prior review and comment by, the Company and reasonably acceptable to the
Company, (ii) the consummation of any such repayment or prepayment shall be
contingent upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time unless otherwise agreed
by the Company, (iii) the Company shall not be required to cause its counsel

indemnified pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to timely
make all notices, and timely take all such other actions, required to be made
by it pursuant to the Credit Facilities and the Indenture in connection with
the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.05.

(b) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as

faith or willful misconduct, as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.05 or

individual is in active employment or on leave, and if on leave, the nature of

ARTICLE 8

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 8.01. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.02. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under Applicable Law.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with
respect thereto. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fail to 

obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to, and in no event shall the Company be permitted to, without Parent's prior
written consent, expend for the policies pursuant to this section an aggregate
premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on Section 8.02(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.02.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives.

Section 8.03. Employee Matters. (a) For the period commencing on the date of
the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof (or such shorter
period of employment, as the case may be), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide Continuing Employees with a base salary or
wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided
to such Continuing Employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. For the period commencing on the
date of the Effective Time through the last day of the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs (or such shorter period of employment, as the case
may be), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
Continuing Employees with target cash incentive opportunities and 

employee benefits (other than any equity or equity-based and change in control
or transaction-based compensation or benefits or severance pay or benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the target cash
incentive opportunities and employee benefits (other than any equity or
equity-based and change in control or transaction-based compensation or
benefits or severance pay or benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees
by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
provide or cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance pay and benefits for
which such Continuing Employee was eligible immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time pursuant to the terms of the severance plans or policies set
forth in Section 8.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Severance
Plans"); provided, that, notwithstanding the terms of any Severance Plan, no
Continuing Employee shall be eligible to receive any payment pursuant to this
Section 8.03(b) as a result of a change in his or her reporting relationship
on or following the Acceptance Time; provided further, however that any
Continuing Employee (A) who is required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to relocate to a work location that is
more than 50 miles from such Continuing Employee's work location in effect
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time or (B) who (x) is an hourly employee
and (y) is assigned by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to a work status representing a reduction of more than
30% in such Continuing Employee's weekly work schedule in effect as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, shall (in the absence of
circumstances giving rise to a just cause termination by his or her employer)
be entitled to resign, with such resignation treated for all purposes as a
termination without cause or otherwise as a termination entitling such
Continuing Employee to receive severance payments and benefits pursuant to
this Section 8.03(b).

(c) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or cause to be
provided) to each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and eligibility to
participate in employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
for which the Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the
Effective Time (but such service credit shall not be provided for benefit
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance) to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any analogous Employee Plan; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that it would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage of the Continuing Employees (and any dependents
thereof) under any welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employees
(and any dependents thereof) may be eligible to participate after the Closing
to the same extent such preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
are waived under any analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee during the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs under the relevant welfare 

benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, prior the Effective Time, to credit of such co-payments
or deductibles under any analogous Employee Plan.

(d) The Company may, in its discretion, pay each current Service Provider an
amount in cash equal to his or her annual cash bonus under the annual
incentive compensation plan or program in which such current Service Provider
participates as of the Acceptance Time in respect of the Company's 2017 fiscal
year, which such bonus shall be (i) based on actual performance through the
Acceptance Time and (ii) prorated for the portion of the 2017 fiscal year that
has elapsed prior to the date of the Acceptance Time (rounded up to the first
day of the month following the month in which the Acceptance Time occurs) (the
"Prorated 2017 Bonus Payment").

(e) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are
necessary to cause each Employee Plan set forth in Section 8.03(e)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to terminate effective as of no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which plans shall nevertheless be
considered to be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of Section 8.03(a). In addition, except as set forth on Section
8.03(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to
enable Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to effect such
actions relating to the Company's 401(k) Plans (each, a "Company 401(k) Plan")
as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including terminating such plan
prior to the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
Section 8.03(e) shall be subject to Parent's prior review and approval. The
Company shall promptly provide all information about the Continuing Employees'
participation in the Employee Plans (including regarding elections) that
Parent reasonably requests to permit Parent to meet its obligations pursuant
to this Section 8.03.

(f) In connection with any termination of any Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to
Section 8.03(e) or otherwise, Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in cash and, to the extent
permitted under the terms of the plan documents (including any applicable
Parent or Surviving Corporation plan documents), participant loans in an
amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee from any Company 401(k)
Plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Affiliates (the "Parent 401(k)
Plan"). Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause the Parent 401(k)
Plan to accept rollovers by Continuing Employees from any Company 401(k) Plan,
including, to the extent permitted under the terms of the plan documents
(including any applicable Parent or Surviving Corporation plan documents),
participant loans, after the Effective Time.

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.06, nothing in this Section
8.03, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any current or former Service
Provider, Company Employee or Continuing 

Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an amendment,
termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish,
terminate or modify, any Employee Plan or other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any
obligation on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the
Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to employ or engage
any Service Provider for any period following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE 9

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 9.01. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all Permits required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
nothing in this Agreement will (and "commercially reasonable efforts" will in
no event) require, or be construed to require, Parent or Merger Sub to (i)
commence or defend any Action by or against any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or take any other action
(including by providing its consent to permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions), or enter into any
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement requiring
any such action, or otherwise proffer or agree to do any of the foregoing,
with respect to any of the businesses, assets or properties of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries other than those
set forth in Section 9.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Specified Actions") (any of the actions described in this proviso, other than
those with respect to the Specified Actions, a "Burdensome Condition").
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take or agree to take
any of the actions described in the definition of "Burdensome Condition"
without the prior written consent of Parent which, without 

limiting Parent's obligations under this Section 9.01(a), may be granted or
withheld in Parent's sole discretion.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10
Business Days after the date hereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information and documentation material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any State Attorney General or
other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (but, absent such request,
the Company shall not take any such action), provided that any such action
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to the Specified Actions and
the businesses, assets and properties referred to in clauses 1-3 of the
definition thereof, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Authority consistent with its obligations hereunder. Each party
hereto shall (1) keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required approvals; (2) promptly notify the other parties of any written
communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority, and, subject to
Applicable Law, permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and

proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (3) promptly consult
with the other party to this Agreement to provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other party
(or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity and furnish the other party with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity, (4) not agree to participate in
any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or
antitrust matters in connection with this Agreement or the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (5)
furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members or their respective staffs on
the other hand, with respect to any competition or antitrust matters in
connection with this Agreement.

Section 9.02. Certain Filings. The Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the
Company 

Disclosure Documents and the Offer Documents and (ii) in determining whether
any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
the Company and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions or make any such filings and furnish information
required in connection therewith or with the Company Disclosure Documents or
the Offer Documents, and seek to timely obtain such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers from parties under such material Contracts, but neither
party shall be required to expend money or modify, amend or otherwise alter
the term or provision of any such Contracts to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 9.03. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release, having any communication with the
press (whether or not for attribution) or making any other public statement,
or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except in respect of any public statement or press release as may
be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press
release or make any such other public statement or schedule any such press
conference or conference call before such consultation; provided, however,
that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to releases or public
statements (i) by the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, but
subject to the Company's and its Representatives' compliance with Section
7.03, or Parent in response thereto, or (ii) by Parent if an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
without prior consultation, each party (a) may communicate information that is
not confidential information of any other party with financial analysts,
investors and media representatives in a manner consistent with its past
practice in compliance with Applicable Law and (b) may disseminate the
information included in a press release or other document previously approved
for external distribution by the other parties.

Section 9.04. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 9.05. Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. The parties shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to be effective
without a 

meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of
Delaware Law as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time.

Section 9.06. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including derivative securities of such Shares) by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with
respect to the Company and will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
1934 Act.

Section 9.07. Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other of: (a) any written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) any material written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than such communications
contemplated in Section 9.01, which shall be governed by such Section); (c)
any Actions commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected
to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied; and (e) any failure of that
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that could reasonably be expected
to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied; provided that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.07 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 9.08. Takeover Statutes. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the respective members of their
boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use
commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and to take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such other actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

communication shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
business day in the place of receipt.



Section 12.02. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties contained herein or in any schedule, instrument document,
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any tender and support agreement entered into by Parent
and any stockholder of the Company) shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 12.03. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the Acceptance
Time, no amendment shall be made that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.03,
no amendment or modification to any of this sentence of this Section 12.03,
the proviso in Section 12.06(a), Section 12.06(c), the provisions of the
second sentence in Section 12.07, Section 12.08 and/or Section 12.09 that is
materially adverse to the Financing Sources shall become effective without the
prior written consent of the materially adversely affected Financing Sources.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law. 

Section 12.04. Expenses. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

(b) Termination Fee. (i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 11.01(c)(i) [Adverse Recommendation Change], 11.01(c)(ii) [Breach of
Non-Solicit], or by the Company pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i) [Superior
Proposal], then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds
$100,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent,
within three Business Days after such termination and, in the case of a
termination by the Company, substantially concurrent with such termination,
and as a condition thereto.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 11.01(b)(i) [End Date] and at such time the conditions set forth in
clauses (B) and (E) of Annex I shall have been satisfied or (y) by Parent
pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(iii) [Other Breach], (B) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to the Board of
Directors and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders an Acquisition
Proposal that is later consummated or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause (C), each reference to
"15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately
available funds, prior to or concurrently with such consummation, the
Termination Fee.

(c) Other Costs and Expenses. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company
fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 12.04,
it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be
paid to (but excluding) the payment date. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay more than one Termination Fee.

Section 12.05. Disclosure Schedule References. Any exception, qualification,
limitation, document or disclosure set forth in a particular section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed to be an exception,
qualification, limitation, document or disclosure with respect to any other
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, if and to the extent that the
relevance of such exception, qualification, limitation or disclosure as an
exception, qualification, limitation, document or disclosure to such other
section is reasonably apparent on its face. The 

inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed
to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it
establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

Section 12.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding on and, except as provided in Section 8.02, shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.02, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided that the provisions of the second sentence in
Section 12.03, this proviso of this Section 12.06(a), Section 12.06(c), the
provisions of the second sentence in Section 12.07, Section 12.08 and Section
12.09, in each case, pertaining to the Financing Sources, are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent without the consent of the Company; provided that Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under
this Agreement.

(c) No Financing Source will have any liability to the Company, any former,
current or future stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents or Affiliates of the Company (in each case, in their
capacities as such), or any former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of any of the
foregoing (in each case, in their capacities as such) (each, a "Related
Party"), relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Financing or
otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
Company will not have any rights or claims against any Financing Source or be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
any Financing Source (such Financing Sources being express third party
beneficiaries of this sentence).

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree that any
claim, suit, action or proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources (in their
capacities as such) arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Financing or the performance of services thereunder
or related thereto shall, except as expressly provided otherwise in the
definitive documentation pertaining to such Financing, be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the 

conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the application of
the laws of any other State.

Section 12.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any suit, action or proceeding against any
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. The parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for
the purpose of any suit, action or proceeding against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby brought by any party hereto and (ii)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the action or proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby may not be enforced in or by the above-named
court.

Section 12.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE).

Section 12.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This 

Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless
each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication).

Section 12.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.



Section 12.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 12.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof for which money damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
referred to in Section 12.08, in addition to any other remedy to which such
party may be entitled under this Agreement. The parties further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which a party is entitled at law or in equity.
