Partnership (including the obligations of the Company Operating Partnership
under the Company Partnership Agreement).

  



  

Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") shall
occur at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time), on the third (3rd) Business Day after all
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions
that by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall have been
satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same or at
such other time and date as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto. The

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing Date, the

respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and
filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the

with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly
executed and filed with the Delaware Secretary as provided under the DLLCA
and (iii) make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be

Merger shall have been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary on the Closing
Date or on such other date and time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the
date the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT and the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary) as shall be
agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger
and Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ") it being understood and agreed that the
parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date and prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing Date, the
Company Operating Partnership and the Parent Operating Partnership shall (i)
cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Partnership Merger (the "
_Partnership Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the
Delaware Secretary as provided under the DRULPA and (ii) make any other
filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Company
Operating Partnership or the Parent Operating Partnership under the DRULPA
in connection with the Partnership Merger. The Partnership Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Partnership Certificate of Merger shall
have been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary on the Closing Date or on
such other date and time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the
Partnership Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary)
as shall be agreed to by the Company Operating Partnership and the Parent
Operating Partnership and specified in the Partnership Certificate of
Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Partnership Merger Effective Time_ "), it being understood and agreed that
the parties shall cause the Partnership Merger Effective Time to occur on the
Closing Date after the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) If the consummation of the Merger prior to the consummation of the
Partnership Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time occurring prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time), as is contemplated by this Agreement,
would cause any of the parties to incur a materially greater amount of
Transfer Taxes than would be incurred if the Merger were consummated following
the consummation of the Partnership Merger (and, therefore, if the Effective
Time were to occur following the Partnership Merger Effective Time), then,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and with the
written consent of Parent and the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the timing of the consummation
of the Merger and Partnership Merger shall be re-ordered so that the Merger
shall occur and be consummated following the consummation of the Partnership
Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time will occur following the
Partnership Merger Effective Time).

  



  

Section 2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and the
Surviving Partnership_. Subject to _Section 6.9_ , at the Effective Time, the
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law and the applicable provisions of such certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
the certificate of limited partnership of the Parent Operating Partnership
and the Parent Partnership Agreement, each as in effect immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, shall be the certificate of limited
partnership and limited partnership agreement of the Surviving
Partnership, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and
the applicable provisions of such certificate of limited partnership and
partnership agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby

Section 3.2 _Proration_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock) that may be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration (which does not include the cash portion of the
Alternative Stock Consideration) pursuant to ___Section 3.2(b)(ii)_ (the "
_Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of twenty-five percent (25%) times the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. All other shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company
Restricted Stock, but other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled as provided in ___Section 3.1(a)(i)_ ) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration or the Alternative Stock
Consideration (including the cash portion of the Alternative
Stock Consideration).

  



  

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among former holders of
Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) of rights to receive
the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration and the Alternative Stock
Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (including
Company Restricted Stock) with respect to which Cash Elections shall have
been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number,
then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration or Alternative Stock
Consideration, as the case may be, and Cash Election Shares held by such
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held
by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number
(with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _____Section 3.2(a)_
, whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down),
with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration or Alternative
Stock Consideration, as the case may be; and

  



  

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than or equal to the Cash Conversion
Number, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Electing Shares and Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
or Alternative Stock Consideration, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right,
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an
election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the
following procedures:

  



  

   

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this ___Section 3.3_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect
to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which
such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

  



  

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to record holders
of Company Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right
to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed the Form of Election to
record holders of Common Stock as of the record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Election Deadline and shall use reasonable best efforts to
make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to all persons who
become holders of shares of Common Stock during the period following the
record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting and prior to the Election
Deadline.

  



  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized
to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which
person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an
agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the
mailing of the Form of Election to Company stockholders, shall have received,
by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed
and accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an "eligible
guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act);
_provided_ , _that_ such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange
Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set
forth in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set
forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly
made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute
discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Company
and Parent, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city
in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later
of (i) the date immediately prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (ii)
the date that Parent and the Company shall agree is five (5) Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to
issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business
Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election
Deadline. If the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate to promptly publicly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline and
Closing.

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates,
or any documents in respect of Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with
the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from Parent or the
Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with ___Article
III_. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Parent
shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not
properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (neither
Parent nor the Company nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify
any stockholder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not
in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares, unless a
proper Election is thereafter timely made with respect to such shares.

  



  

(f) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent and the
Company, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall have the joint
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be
taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by _Section 3.2_
, (ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted into the right to receive in the Merger and (iii) the method of
payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, at the
Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , (i)
evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration or stock portion
of the Alternative Stock Consideration, as may be applicable, and (ii)
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration and the
cash portion of the Alternative Stock Consideration, if any (together with,
to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 3.14_ ) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ")
and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash
Consideration and the cash portion of the Alternative Stock Consideration, if
any, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.
The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Entity. Interest and other income on
the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Entity and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy Parent's obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

Section 3.5 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (which, to the extent Stock Consideration or the stock portion
of the Alternative Stock Consideration, as may be applicable, shall be
in non-certificated book-entry form) in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and
after the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights
with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Entity for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 3.8 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any
cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock) to which they are entitled
under this _Article III_  shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 3.9 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Parent Operating Partnership, the Company Operating Partnership, the
Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of any cash
that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested
and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such number of shares
of Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such acceleration to
satisfy any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes (assuming a
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the closing
price of the Company Common Stock on the last completed trading day
immediately prior to the Closing). All shares of Company Common Stock then-
outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the shares of
Company Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes shall have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this ___Section 3.10_.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each and any Parent Party, Company Party,
the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration and/or, otherwise, any
other amounts or property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as
such Parent Party, Company Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving
Partnership or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment or distribution under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority by a Parent Party, a Company
Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent,
as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent Party, the Company Party,
the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable.

Section 3.12 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.13 _Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall

contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.14 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive
(aggregating for this purpose all the shares of Parent Common Stock such
holder is entitled to receive hereunder), in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (b) the per share closing price
of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date on the NASDAQ, as reported in The
Wall Street Journal.

standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good

standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite organizational power
and authority and any necessary governmental authorization to own, lease and,

Subsidiary that would not constitute a "significant subsidiary" (as
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X), for such failures to be so

by reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or
restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets
is permitted only in accordance with management's authorization; (4) the
reporting of such assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are
recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. The Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls, and the Company has made available to
Parent copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly

subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not received any comments
from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings since March 22,
2012 which remain unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or
information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the Company
which has not been adequately addressed. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff
of the SEC received since March 22, 2012 through the date of this Agreement
relating to the Company SEC Filings and all written responses of the Company
thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company SEC Filings

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications
and clearances that are the subject of ___Section 5.14_ , which are addressed
solely in that Section, Parent, Merger Sub and each other Parent Subsidiary

all such Parent Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where
the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full
force and effect of, any of the Parent Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All applications required to have been filed for the
renewal of Parent Permits have been duly filed on a timely basis with the
appropriate Governmental Authority, and all other filings required to have
been made with respect to such Parent Permits have been duly made on a timely
basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority, except in each case for
failures to file which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any claim or notice nor
has any knowledge indicating that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is
currently not in compliance with the terms of any such Parent Permits,
except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any such
Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not

such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after February 11, 2011 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each
Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did
not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent
Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

52 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated
by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any
non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts,
notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper
and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent's internal controls, and Parent has made
available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including
its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parent's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on Parent's
most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Parent
SEC Filings, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including ___Section 6.2_ hereof,
(ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC
Filings made through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii)
described in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that,

Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form

call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting shall
not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this ___Section 6.3(c)_ , if, on a date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the

Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Parent Stockholder

twenty (120) days after the record date for the Parent Stockholder Meeting.

obligation to submit the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval
thereof.

Entities that is provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or Merger

adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit any Company Entity
to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
___Section 6.5_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board shall be permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board (A) (x) has received an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_  unless (i) the Company
has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_
") to the Parent Parties that the Company intends to take such action,
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to ___Section 6.5(d)(A)_ , describing
the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood
that such material terms shall include the identity of the Third Party), (ii)
during the three (3) Business Day period following the Parent Parties'
receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Parent Parties in good
faith (to the extent the Parent Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer necessary, and (iii) following the
end of the three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed
in writing by the Parent Parties in response to the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change or otherwise, (x) that in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _____Section 6.5(d)(A)_ , the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change,
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and, (y) after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' duties under applicable Law. After compliance with this
___Section 6.5(e)_ with respect to any two Superior Proposals, the Company
shall have no further obligations under this ___Section 6.5(e)_ , and the
Company Board shall not be required to comply with such obligation with
respect to any other Superior Proposal.

shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Company's stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation (and/or an
express reaffirmation of the Company's approval of the Partnership Merger)
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) The Company Parties shall, and shall cause each of the other Company
Entities, and its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent,
and other Representatives to (i) immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action as is necessary
to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to
which any Company Entity is a party or of which any Company Entity is a
beneficiary. The Company Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential information regarding
any Company Entity in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months prior to the date
of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information (to the
extent that they are entitled to have such information returned or
destroyed).

Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the transaction described in such
proposal, including the identity of the Person making such proposal, any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to

Company Parties, if, to the knowledge of such party, the occurrence of any

indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the

liability insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for
a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under
the Company's existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower
than the limits on the Company's existing policies as long as the annual
premium in the aggregate does not exceed in any one year three hundred
percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) under the Company's existing
policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i)
the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Company's current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Entity to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Company's
DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier,
that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the
Company (which may be provided under Parent's DandO Insurance policy) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of (for any one year) three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

that ended on December 31, 2011, Parent has been organized and has operated
in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code, and its proposed method of operation will enable Parent to
continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT

opinion, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP may rely upon the Company Tax Representation Letter and Parent Tax
Representation Letter. The condition set forth in this ___Section 7.3(f)_

satisfied; or

respective Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party
hereto shall cease;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing to the contrary, (a) no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from or arising out of any
fraud or willful and malicious breach of this Agreement and (b) the

(x) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to any of the Company Parties or any Person shall have publicly

publicly withdrawn without qualification before such termination), and (y)
the Company, within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement,
consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which
is later consummated with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, the Termination Payment, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, not later
than the consummation of such transaction arising from such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of this
_____Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , the references to "ten percent (10%)" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)"; or

  



  

   

94 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _____Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ ,

Business Days of such termination; or

  



  

(iii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _____Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ ,
and (x) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made to any of the Company Parties or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition

withdrawn without qualification before such termination), and (y) the
Company, within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement,
consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which
is later consummated with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee plus, if
not previously paid pursuant to _____Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ above, the Parent
Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent, not later than the consummation of such transaction arising from such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of this  _ ___
_Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ , the references to "ten percent (10%)" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)"; or

  



  

(iv) by the Company pursuant to _____Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , then the Company
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Payment, by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent as a condition
to the effectiveness of such termination; or

  



  

(v) by Parent pursuant to _____Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , then the Company shall

party entitled to payment; and

  



  

   

95 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay
the Termination Payment or the Company Expense Amount on more than one
occasion.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this ___Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Payment nor the Company
Expense Amount is a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this ___Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this
___Section 8.3_ , such paying party shall pay the other party its costs and
Expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) for the period from the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

  



  

(d) (i) If one party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is
required to pay another party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payee_ ")
the Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, such
Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, shall be
paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the
Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this
Section _8.3(d)_. In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay
the Termination Payee the Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as
the case may be, the amount payable to the Termination Payee in any tax year
of the Termination Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination
Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, of the Termination
Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax
year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from
unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition
to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each
case, as determined by the Termination Payee's independent accountants, plus
(B) in the event the Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the
Termination Payee's counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has
received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this ___Section 8.3(d)_
or (y) an opinion from the Termination Payee's outside counsel as described
below in this Section _8.3(d)_ , an amount equal to the excess of the
Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, less the
amount payable under clause (A) above.

  



  

   

96 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) To secure the Termination Payor's obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, with an
escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on such terms (subject to this
_____Section 8.3(d)_ ) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Termination
Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may
be, pursuant to this _____Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount
pursuant to _____Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall
provide that the Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the
case may be, in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the
Termination Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of
the following: (i) a letter from the Termination Payee's independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter from the
Termination Payee's counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may
be, would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B)
the Termination Payee's outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the
effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination Payment or
Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, should either constitute
Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment or Company Expense
Amount, as the case may be, to the Termination Payee. The Termination Payor
agrees to amend this _____Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the
Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, that may be
distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without causing the
Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Termination Payee's chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this _____Section 8.3(d)_ or (iii) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel as described in this _____Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount of the
Termination Payment or Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, that
remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as
possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _____Section 8.3(d)_ , provided that the obligation of
the Termination Payor to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination Payment or
Company Expense Amount, as the case may be, shall terminate on the December
31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval and prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall
not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form
of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company or Parent without such further approval of such stockholders,
or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
each of the parties hereto.

applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_ , waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
and Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and
filing of the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint
Proxy Statement, other than attorneys' and accountants' fees.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to
Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall pay or cause to be paid, without
deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders
of the Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect promptly the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.9_ (from and after the Effective Time),
which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in such section. The

negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable

adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties

specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.
