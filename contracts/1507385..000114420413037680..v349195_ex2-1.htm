sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)&nbsp;transactions are executed only in accordance with management&rsquo;s
authorization; (2)&nbsp;transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company

accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
The Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company&rsquo;s auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies
of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company&rsquo;s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in the Company&rsquo;s periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has

reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)&nbsp;transactions are executed only in accordance with management&rsquo;s
authorization; (2)&nbsp;transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and

principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent&rsquo;s auditors and the audit committee

report financial data, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parent&rsquo;s internal controls, and Parent has made available to the Company copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined
in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parent&rsquo;s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods
in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in Parent&rsquo;s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since
the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans

the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
