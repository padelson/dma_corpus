are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit

Consideration (as reduced at the Closing by the Per Share Portion of the
Escrow Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount) payable in respect of
each Company Share (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 3.01(f)_ and the Dissenting Shares referred to in _Section 3.03_)
represented thereby as provided in this _Article III_; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

Section 3.03 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are
held by Company Stockholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger,
consented thereto in writing or otherwise contractually waived their

 



      
 

 



 

rights to appraisal and who have complied with all of the relevant provisions
of the DGCL with respect thereto (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration (as reduced at the Closing by the Per Share
Portion of the Escrow Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount) unless
and until such Company Stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares, if any, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent, then as of the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and as of the Effective Time shall
be converted into and represent the right to receive the Applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration (as reduced at the Closing by the Per Share Portion of
the Escrow Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount) in accordance with
_Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.04_.

other cashless basis), and (vii) a schedule setting forth the Applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration, the Pre-Closing Percentage of each Company
Stockholder and each Participating Optionholder, and the Per Share Portion of
the Escrow Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount, allocable to each

updated at or before Closing to the extent of any changes to the Closing
Certificate after delivery thereof, the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ "). Each
item included in the Closing Certificate shall be calculated in accordance
with the corresponding definitions in this Agreement and using the Estimated
Working Capital as the Actual Working Capital. The Closing Certificate shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles
used in the preparation of the Most Recent Balance Sheet and the _Working
Capital Schedule_ attached hereto **.**

 



 

(b) At and upon the Effective Time, Parent shall make the following payments:

 



 

(i) the Escrow Amount shall be deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent to be
held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the " _Representative Holdback Amount_ ")
shall be deposited by Parent with the Representative to satisfy potential
future obligations of the Company Stockholders and Participating
Optionholders, which Representative Holdback Amount will be retained by the
Representative for such time as the Representative will determine in its sole
discretion (and any remaining amounts distributed from the Representative

Participating Optionholders pro rata in accordance with each such Persons
Pre-Closing Percentage); and

 



 

(iii) the remaining amount of the aggregate cash consideration to be paid by
Parent under this _Article III_ (after giving effect to the payments made
pursuant to _Section 3.04(c)_ and _(d)_ ) shall be remitted to the
Representative to be distributed to the Company Stockholders and Participating
Optionholders pursuant to the Final Allocation Schedule; _provided_ that, at
the Representatives election, by written notice to Parent, the portion of the
aggregate cash consideration payable to the Participating Optionholders shall
instead be paid to the Surviving Corporation and in such event the Surviving
Corporation shall distribute such amounts to Participating Optionholders in
accordance with the Final Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(c) At and upon the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies

Section 3.05 _Post Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly, but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, Parent and its auditors shall prepare, or shall cause the Company to
prepare, and deliver to the Representative a statement, duly certified by
Parent as accurately setting forth Parents good faith determination of the
Working Capital of the Acquired Companies (in each case as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing and determined
on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Most Recent Balance Sheet and the
_Working Capital Schedule_ attached hereto), together with (x) the
consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies from which such
determinations were derived and (y) such other relevant information on which
the calculations reflected thereon are based (such statement, together with
such accompanying balance sheet and other information, the " _Closing
Statement_ ").

 



 

(b) If the Representative disagrees with Parents determination of Working
Capital, in each case as reflected on the Closing Statement, the
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing
Statement, deliver a written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent
setting forth the Representatives calculation of each disputed amount (each
an " _Item of Dispute_ "). The Representative shall have access to all books
and records and work papers (including those of Parents and the Acquired
Companies accountants and auditors) relating to the Closing Statement and all
other items reasonably requested by the Representative related thereto during
normal business hours, subject to entering into such confidentiality
agreements as may be reasonably required by such accountants and auditors in
order to provide such access. If the Representative does not deliver a Dispute
Notice to Parent within thirty (30) days after delivery by Parent to the
Representative of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be
conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. If the Representative
delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent within thirty (30) days after delivery by
Parent of the Closing Statement, Parent and the Representative shall work in
good faith to resolve each Item of Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so
resolved, the Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to
reflect such resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the
twentieth (20th) day after delivery by the Representative of the Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Representative shall jointly retain an independent
valuation firm of recognized national standing to resolve such remaining
disagreement who shall be KPMG LLP; _provided_ that, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to serve, or if Parent and the Representative are unable to agree
with such firm on terms for its engagement that are reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Representative, then an alternative firm that is a nationally
recognized valuation firm shall be selected by lot, after excluding one firm
designated by Parent and one firm designated by the Representative (the firm
actually retained pursuant to this sentence, the " _Valuation Firm_ "). Parent
and the Representative shall request that the Valuation Firm render a
determination as to each unresolved Item of Dispute within thirty (30) days
after its retention, and Parent and the Representative shall, and Parent shall
cause the Acquired Companies and each of their respective agents and
representatives to, cooperate fully with the Valuation Firm so as to enable it
to make such determination as quickly

 



      
 

 



 

and accurately as reasonably practicable, including the provision by Parent
and the Acquired Companies of all books and records and work papers (including
those of their accountants and auditors) relating to the Closing Statement and
all other items reasonably requested by the Valuation Firm (in each case in
such a manner so as not to waive or eliminate any privilege applicable to any
such information). The Valuation Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts that were set forth on the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice
and that remain unresolved by Parent and the Representative. In resolving any
Item of Dispute, the Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party, or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party, on the Closing
Statement or the Dispute Notice, as applicable. The Valuation Firms
determination(s) shall be based upon the definitions of Working Capital
included herein. The Valuation Firms determination of each Item of Dispute
submitted to it shall be in writing, shall conform with this _Section 3.05_
and shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties, and the Closing
Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect such
determination(s). The fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be
allocated between Parent on the one hand, and the Representative on the other
hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each such Party bears to the amount actually contested by such
Party. The Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.05_ is referred to herein as the " _Actual Working Capital_ ".

 



 

(c) _Payments to Parent_. If the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the
Actual Working Capital, the Representative (on behalf of the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders) shall, within ten (10) Business
Days after determination of the Actual Working Capital, instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Parent, an amount in the aggregate equal to the
excess of the Estimated Working Capital over the Actual Working Capital.

 



 

(d) _Payments by Parent_. If the Actual Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Working Capital, Parent shall pay to the Representative (on behalf
of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after determination of the Actual Working Capital, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Representative an amount equal to the excess of the Actual Working Capital
over the Estimated Working Capital. Any amounts received pursuant to this
_Section 3.05(d)_ shall be distributed by the Representative to the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders pro rata in accordance with each
such Persons Pre-Closing Percentage as set forth on the Final Allocation
Schedule.

 



 

Section 3.06 _Revenue Run-Rate Adjustment_. The Merger Consideration shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in _Part 3_ of _Schedule B_ hereto.

 



 

Section 3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Persons are required
to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons receiving
the amounts otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

the businesses of the Acquired Companies, including the possession of or
application for all permits, licenses, registrations and authorizations of
Governmental Authorities required under applicable Law for the current
operation of the businesses of the Acquired Companies, including applicable
federal and state securities Laws and capital and other financial resources

except for properties and assets that have been sold or otherwise disposed of
by the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, each Acquired
Company has good and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of
the real properties and tangible assets used in the conduct of such Acquired
Companys

 



      
 

 



 

business as currently conducted, including all the properties and assets
reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet, subject to no Liens except
Permitted Liens. The assets of the Acquired Companies and assets for which the
Acquired Companies have a leasehold interest or license comprise all of the
material assets, properties and rights of every type and description, whether
real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in or necessary to the conduct
of the businesses of the Acquired Companies as presently conducted and are
adequate and sufficient in all material respects to conduct the businesses of
the Acquired Companies as presently conducted.

(a) The Acquired Companies do not own, and within the last ten (10) years have
not owned, any real property.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 4.11(b)(i)_ sets forth the address of each parcel of Leased
Real Property, and a true and complete list of all Leases for each such parcel
of Leased Real Property. The Acquired Companies have delivered to Parent a
true and complete copy of each such Lease document and all extensions,
amendments and other modifications, if any. With respect to each of the
Leases: (i) such Lease is legal, valid and binding, and such Lease is
enforceable and in full force and effect subject to proper authorization and
execution of such Lease by the other party thereto and the application of any
bankruptcy or other creditors rights Laws and (ii) the Acquired Company party
thereto is not in breach or default under such Lease, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, no other party thereto is in breach or default under such Lease
and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of
notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such breach or default,
except to the extent such breach or default would not be material to the
Acquired Companies.

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, all buildings, structures, improvements,
fixtures, building systems and equipment, and all components thereof, included
in the Leased Real Property (the " _Improvements_ ") are in good condition and
repair, except for normal wear and tear, and are in all material respects
sufficient for the operation of the businesses of the Acquired Companies as
presently conducted. There are no structural deficiencies or latent defects
affecting any of the Improvements, and there are no facts or conditions
affecting any of the Improvements which would be material to the Acquired
Companies.

Tax Returns required to be filed by it. All such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed by each Acquired Company
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid in full. No
claim has ever been made in writing by an authority in a jurisdiction where an
Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that such Acquired Company is or
may be subject to taxation by, or required to file a Tax Return in, that
jurisdiction. There are no Liens with respect to Taxes upon any asset of the
Acquired Companies other than Permitted Liens for current Taxes not yet due
and payable.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Except as described on _Schedule 4.12(b)_ , each Acquired Company has
deducted, withheld and timely paid or caused to be deducted, withheld and
timely paid, to the appropriate Taxing Authority all Taxes required to be
deducted, withheld or paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contract, creditor, stockholder or other third party,
and each Acquired Company has complied in all material respects with reporting
and recordkeeping requirements. The Acquired Companies have at all times
properly classified each provider of services to the Acquired Companies as an
employee or independent contractor for Tax purposes and none of the Acquired
Companies has any Tax liability with respect to any misclassification of any
Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.

 



 

(c) There is no Tax deficiency outstanding, assessed or proposed in writing
against any of the Acquired Companies. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.12(c)_ , no dispute, audit, claim or Action in respect of any Tax liability

Sellers Knowledge, no such dispute, audit, claim or Action is pending.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.12(d)_ , no Acquired Company has waived
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes, or agreed to, or is the
beneficiary of any extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or
deficiency. No Acquired Company has executed any power of attorney with
respect to any Tax, other than powers of attorney that are no longer in force.
No closing agreements, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda or
similar agreements or rulings relating to Taxes have been entered into, issued
by, or requested from any Taxing Authority with or in respect of any Acquired
Company.

 



 

(e) The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies (i) did not as of the date of
the Most Recent Balance Sheet exceed the reserve for Taxes (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet
(rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve
adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies in filing their Tax
Returns. The deferred Tax assets and liabilities set forth on the face of the
Most Recent Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) properly reflect
the timing difference between book and tax income in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(f) No Acquired Company has made any payments, or has been or is a party to
any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that could result in it making
payments, that have resulted or would result, separately or in the aggregate,

Section 280G or in the imposition of an excise Tax under Code Section 4999 (or
any corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law).

corporation" within the meaning of Code Section 355(a)(1)(A).

local or

 



      
 

 



 

foreign law) filing a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return (other than
the "affiliated group," or analogue for state, local or foreign law purposes,
the common parent of which is the Company). No Acquired Company is party any
contractual obligation relating to Tax sharing or Tax allocation. No Acquired
Company has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than an Acquired

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.12(i)_ , no Acquired Company is or has
been required to make any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code
(or any predecessor provision) or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law by reason of any change in accounting methods, and there is no
application pending with any Taxing Authority requesting permission for any
changes in any of its accounting methods for Tax purposes. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no Taxing Authority has proposed any such adjustment or change in
accounting method.

 



 

(j) No Acquired Company will be required to include any amount in taxable
income or exclude any item of deduction or loss from taxable income for any
taxable period, or portion thereof, ending after the Closing Date as a result
of (i) any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax

(m) No Acquired Company is a member of an entity classified as a partnership
or a disregarded entity for federal income Tax purposes.

(a) _Schedule 4.13(a)_ identifies (i) all registered Intellectual Property
Rights owned by any Acquired Company; (ii) each pending application or
application for registration of any Intellectual Property Rights owned by any
Acquired Company (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Company Registered

with respect to any Licensed Company Intellectual Property (including any

purposes under this Agreement if a new Investment Advisory Arrangement has

Date, the Parent and the Company shall continue to use the same efforts to
obtain the consents required by _Sections 7.05(a)_ and _(b)_ as are required

materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto) to be furnished to the

data that is provided by or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates specifically
for inclusion in such proxy materials (such approval not to be unreasonably

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each ALPS Advised Fund

such Funds affairs as a consequence of the Merger, and (ii) make any other
filing necessary under the Securities Laws to satisfy disclosure requirements
to enable the public distribution of the shares of that ALPS Advised Fund to
continue. Parent shall have the right to review and provide reasonable
comments on such materials to the same extent as provided in _Section
6.06(a)_.

 



 

(c) The Company shall bear all of the costs, fees and expenses incurred by or
on behalf of the ALPS Advised Funds in connection with the proxy statements

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing, Parent shall not engage,

its Affiliates and any registered investment company managed or advised by any
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date of this

procedures and limitations set forth in _Article X_, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 7.10_. For the avoidance of doubt, recovery against
the Escrow Account constitutes the first and primary remedy for any and all
Tax Claims for so long as the Escrow Account is outstanding; _provided_ that
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have the right to either (x) recover
against the Escrow Account for any and all Tax Claims or (y) recover directly
from the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders on a pro rata
basis (based upon their respective Pre-Closing Percentages as set forth on the
Final Allocation Schedule and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.04_) for any and all Tax Claims and not utilize the Escrow Amount for such
purpose, if and only to the extent that (1) an individual Tax Claim includes
Damages in excess of $100,000 or (2) all Tax Claims in the aggregate as of any
given time include Damages in excess of $500,000.

 



 

(b) _Tax Refunds_. Tax refunds that are actually received by Parent or any of
the Acquired Companies that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof of any
of the Acquired Companies ending on or before the Closing Date (other than
refunds attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute attributable to a Tax
period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date) shall be for the
account of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders, and, with
respect to any such refund, Parent shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, pay over to the Representative (on behalf and for the benefit of
the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders) such refund, net of
any Tax or reasonable out-of-pocket costs attributable to such refund,
promptly, and in any event no later than within fifteen (15) days after
receipt thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , this _Section 7.10(b)_ shall not
apply to any tax refunds to the extent arising from or attributable to Company
Transaction Expenses or the cash-out of any Options and/or shares of
Restricted Stock.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent shall (and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to), and the Representative shall, cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Partys request and at its cost) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each of Parent and the
Representative further agrees upon request of the other and at its cost to use
its commercially reasonable efforts (so long as there are no adverse effects
on the other Party) to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including any Transfer
Taxes).

 



 

(d) _Preparation of Income Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Income Tax Returns for the Acquired
Companies that are filed or are required to be filed after the Closing Date.
Parent **** shall provide to the Representative drafts of each Income Tax
Return that includes any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior
to the Closing for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the filing
thereof. The Representative shall provide comments with proposed changes (if
any) to the Parent within 15

 



      
 

 



 

days after the receipt of such Income Tax Return and Parent shall consider
such comments and proposed changes in good faith.

 



 

(e) _Amended Returns_. Without the prior written consent of the
Representative, the Parent will not amend or permit any of its Affiliates or
the Acquired Companies to amend any Tax Return relating to a period or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Audits of Tax Returns_. The Parent shall or shall cause any of its
Affiliates to notify the Representative in writing within fifteen (15)
Business Days upon receipt of any notice of any pending or threatened audit,
notice of deficiency, examination, assessment or any other administrative
proceeding or court proceeding initiated by a Taxing Authority relating to any
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The
Representative will have the responsibility for, and the right to control, at
its own expense, the audit (including any claims or litigation arising
therefrom) of any Income Tax Return of the Acquired Companies relating to a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders have agreed to indemnify Parent
pursuant to this Agreement and the Participation Agreements, including any
disposition of such audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Acquired Companies will have the right, directly or through their designated
representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all submissions made in
the course of audits of such Income Tax Returns (including any administrative
appeals thereof), and Parents consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any settlement by the
Representative that could affect the Tax liability of Parent or any of the
Acquired Companies in any taxable period after the Closing Date. With respect
to all other Tax Returns, Parent and the Acquired Companies will have the sole
responsibility for, and the right to control the audit of, such Tax Returns,
but, with respect to any Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Representative
shall have the right to participate in and approve the disposition of the
audit of any such Tax Return (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) that would adversely affect the Liability of the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders to indemnify Parent with respect
to Taxes pursuant to this Agreement and the Participation Agreements.

 



 

(g) _Allocation of Tax Liability for Straddle Periods_. For purposes of
_Section 7.10(a)_ and _Article X_, in the case of any Taxes that are payable
for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the
portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to (i) in the case of Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and not based or measured by receipts,
net income or gain, activities, events or level of any item, the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the portion of the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Tax
period, and (ii) in all other cases, the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date (and for such
purpose the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity
will be deemed to terminate at such time).

 



 

(h) _No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. The transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not part of an intermediary transaction tax shelter as
described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

or in the aggregate, without regard to the measures described herein, to
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)
and the applicable rulings and regulations thereunder (" _Section 280G
Payments_"), take all measures reasonably necessary to obtain a shareholder
vote which, if successful, satisfies the requirements of Code Section
280G(b)(5), including exerting its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers,
such that no portion of the Section 280G Payments will constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(1). The Company
shall forward to Parent prior to submission to the Companys stockholders
copies of all material documents prepared by the Company in connection with
this _Section 7.10(i)_.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges
and similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes,
shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by the Representative (on behalf
of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders). The
Representative and Parent shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the
provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest
extent possible under such Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable
in connection therewith.

Merger Consideration but was not so deducted; (v) any claims for appraisal
rights made by Dissenting Stockholders; (vi) any errors in the Final
Allocation Schedule, any inaccuracy in the amount of Cash Equivalents used to
determinate Net Indebtedness for purposes of calculating the Merger
Consideration, any failure of the Final Allocation Schedule to comply with the
Certificate of Incorporation, or any failure by the Representative to
distribute the proceeds actually received by it hereunder in its capacity as
such (and excluding any distributions of proceeds made by the Surviving
Corporation in the event of an election pursuant to _Section 3.04(b)(iii)_)
to each Company Stockholder and Participating Optionholder in accordance with
this Agreement and the Final Allocation Schedule; or (vii) any fraud of any
Acquired Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby,

 



      
 

 



 

the Disclosure Schedule, or any ancillary document or in any instrument or
certificate required to be delivered pursuant hereto.

 



 

Section 10.04 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



 

(a) Once the aggregate amount of Damages has exceeded the Deductible, the
Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders shall not be required to
indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to, and shall not have any
liability under, this Agreement for any Damages if, with respect to any
individual Damages item, such item is less than $50,000 (" _Minor Claim_ ").

 



 

(b) The Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders shall not be
required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to, and shall not
have any liability under, this Agreement, until the aggregate amount of all
Damages for which the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
would, but for this _Section 10.04(b)_, be liable under this Agreement
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,500,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "); _provided_ that, if and to the extent such Damages exceed the
Deductible, the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders shall
become liable for only such Damages that exceed the Deductible and are not a
Minor Claim;

 



 

(c) The limitations set forth in _Section 10.04(a)_ and ( _b_ ) shall not
apply to (i) any claim for indemnification hereunder under _Section 10.03(i)_
in respect of any of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) any claim for
indemnification under _Section 7.10_ or _Section 10.03(ii)_ through ( _vi_
), or (iii) any claim based upon fraud (the foregoing, collectively, the "
_Exempt Claims_ "). Except for Exempt Claims and except as specifically set
forth in the Participation Agreements, the Company Stockholders and
Participating Optionholders shall not be required to indemnify any Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to, and shall not have any liability under, this
Agreement for any Damages in excess of the then-remaining balance of the
Escrow Account, including any earnings thereon. All indemnification
obligations of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders in
excess of the Escrow Account shall be several (based upon each Persons Pro
Rata Percentage as set forth on the Final Allocation Schedule) and not joint.

 



 

(d) With respect to Exempt Claims, subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 10.04(d)_, no Company Stockholder or Participating Optionholder
shall be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to, and
no Company Stockholder or Participating Optionholder shall have any liability
under, this Agreement for Damages in respect of Exempt Claims (" _Exempt
Claims Damages_ ") once all Damages, calculated cumulatively, exceed an
aggregate amount equal to the total cash proceeds received by such Company
Stockholder or Participating Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement. In
addition, with respect to any claims for indemnification under _Section 7.10_
or for a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.12_ (collectively, " _Tax Claims_ "), following the earlier to occur of (i)
the release in full of all amounts held in the Escrow Account and (ii) the
Expiration Date, the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
shall not be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to,
and shall not have any liability under, this Agreement for any Tax Claims
until the aggregate amount of all Tax Claims first being asserted under this
Agreement after the earlier of the dates specified in clauses (i) or (ii)
above exceed on a cumulative basis an

 



      
 

 



 

amount equal to $25,000 (the " _Tax Claims Threshold_ "); _provided_ that, if
and to the extent such Tax Claims exceed the Tax Claims Threshold, the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders shall become liable for all such
Tax Claims from the first dollar.

 



 

(e) For purposes of determining any Damages in respect of which the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders have liability under this
_Article X_, appropriate reductions shall be made to reflect (i) the Tax
benefits, if any, actually realized by any Parent Indemnified Party in the
taxable year in which the Damages are incurred, and (ii) the recovery received
by any Parent Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages pursuant to any
insurance policy. If an indemnification payment is received by any Parent
Indemnified Party, and such Parent **** Indemnified Party later recognizes Tax
benefits which are actually realized by any Parent Indemnified Party in the
taxable year in which the Damages are incurred or any insurance recoveries, as
and when described in the immediately preceding sentence, in respect of the
related Damages or indemnification payments, that were not previously
accounted for with respect to such Damages or indemnification payments when
made, Parent shall promptly notify the Representative, and promptly, but in
any event no later than five (5) Business Days after delivery of such notice
by Parent, shall pay to the Representative an amount equal to the lesser of
(A) any such insurance recoveries and Tax benefits, and (B) the actual amount
of the indemnification payments previously paid by the Company with respect to
such Damages.

 



 

(f) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of a Company Stockholder or
Participating Optionholder for fraud on the part of such Company Stockholder
or such Participating Optionholder, or on the part of the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Disclosure Schedule, or any ancillary document or in any instrument or
certificate required to be delivered pursuant hereto.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
in connection with any Non-Exempt Claims, for purposes of determining whether
a breach of this Agreement has occurred, as well as for calculating the amount
of Damages to which any indemnification for Non-Exempt Claims would apply,
each representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without
giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect," materiality or similar
qualifications contained therein and (ii) in connection with any Exempt
Claims, solely for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which any
indemnification for Exempt Claims would apply (i.e., for the avoidance of
doubt, not for purposes of determining whether a breach of this Agreement has
occurred), each representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read
without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect," materiality or similar
qualifications contained therein; _provided_ that, this _Section 10.04(g)_
shall not in any way modify the use of "Material Adverse Effect" in _Section
4.08_ or the use of the word "Material" in the term "Material Contract."

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to
_Section 10.04(f)_, the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
shall not have any liability or otherwise be required to indemnify any of the
Parent Indemnified Parties for any Damages as set forth in _Part 8_ of
_Schedule B_ hereto.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Indemnification by Parent_. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Company Stockholders, the Participating Optionholders and
their respective Affiliates,

 



      
 

 



 

officers, directors and representatives (the " _Company Stockholder
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Damages to the extent resulting from (i)
any inaccuracy in any representation or the breach of any warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, any ancillary document or in any
instrument or certificate required to be delivered pursuant hereto and/or (ii)
any breach or violation by Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement
to be performed by it hereunder or any covenant or agreement of the Company to
the extent required to be performed or complied with by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing, in either case in or pursuant to this
Agreement or any ancillary agreement.

 



 

In accordance with _Section 11.16_, all claims brought by any Company
Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10.05_ shall be
brought, prosecuted, negotiated and settled only by, and any indemnification
payments shall be made only to, the Representative, and the Representative (on
behalf of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders) shall be
deemed to be the Indemnified Party with respect to any Company Stockholder
Party that is an Indemnified Party under this _Article X_.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in _Section 3.05_,
_Section 9.02_, _Section 10.04(f)_ or _Section 11.02_, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article X_, _Section 7.10_, and as expressly
provided for in the Participation Agreements. In furtherance of the foregoing,
but without limiting the rights of indemnification expressly provided for
under this _Article X,_ each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and except
as provided in _Section 3.05_, _Section 9.02_, _Section 10.04(f)_ or
_Section 11.02_, any and all rights, claims and causes of action relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby
(including any right, whether arising at Law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or
remedy, including the remedy of rescission and remedies that may arise under
common law) it may have against any Indemnifying Party whether arising under
or based upon any Law or otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) To be entitled under this Agreement to indemnification in respect of a
claim or demand by another Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), an Indemnified
Party must deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly, but in any event with
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim,
written notice thereof, specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent then
known by the Indemnified Party, the amount of such claim and the nature and
basis of such claim. **** Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party informed on a reasonably current basis as to any
significant changes or material developments with respect to the foregoing,
including providing copies of all notices and material documents (including
court papers) from time to time received by the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates or representatives relating to the Third Party Claim. The
failure to so notify or to so keep informed the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party. Should an Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Third Party Claim is made by a customer
or supplier of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party in good faith
determines that the conduct of the defense or any proposed settlement of such
Third Party Claim would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent or the Acquired Companies to conduct its respective
business, or if the Indemnified Party in good faith determines, based on the
advice of outside counsel, that (i) a conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party
Claim which is relevant to the Indemnifying Party assuming such defense or
(ii) that the Indemnified Party has available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take over and control
the defense, settlement, negotiation or Action relating to any such Third
Party Claim, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Indemnified Party does so take over and control, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, each Party shall reasonably cooperate in
the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information (including
those of the Acquired Companies, if applicable) which are reasonably requested
and relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees (including those
of the Acquired Companies, if applicable) available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. No compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim may
be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law,
(ii) there is no injunctive or other equitable relief implicated, (iii) the
amount payable in respect of such claim is less than the amount available in
the Escrow Account to satisfy such claim pursuant to the terms of this
_Article X_, and (iv) each Indemnified Party that is Party to such Third
Party Claim is fully and unconditionally released from liability with respect
to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnification
obligations with respect to any Third Party Claim which is settled by the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense and to
settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party Claim (with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

conditioned or delayed)) without prejudice to the ability of the Indemnified
Party to enforce its claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder.

 



 

(c) This _Section 10.07_ shall not apply to Third Party Claims in respect of
Taxes, which shall be governed solely by _Section 7.10(f)_.

 



 

Section 10.08 _Procedures for Inter-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such claim, the nature and basis
of the alleged breach giving rise to such claim and all relevant facts and
circumstances relating thereto. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced, or
materially increased the amount of Damages payable by, the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable
access to its books and records (and, if the Company Stockholders and
Participating Optionholders are the Indemnifying Party, the Acquired
Companies books and records) during normal business hours for the purpose of
allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such
claim for Damages. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
within forty five (45) days following its receipt of such notice and granting
of such access if the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article X._ If the Indemnifying Party does not
so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party
in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the
Indemnifying Party under this _Article X_, and the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the
claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided
above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. Promptly following the final determination
of the amount of Damages to which the Indemnified Party is entitled (whether
determined in accordance with this _Section 10.08_ or by a court of competent
jurisdiction), the Indemnifying Party shall pay such Damages to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with _Section 10.11_.

 



 

Section 10.09 _Duty to Mitigate_. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount of any Damages
that it incurs in connection with any matter with respect to which it is
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant
to this _Article X_ to the extent required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to take any
actions to mitigate the amount of Damages with respect to Taxes to the extent
such actions would have an adverse impact on such Indemnified Party. In
addition and without limitation of the foregoing obligation, if the
Indemnified Party is Parent or any Acquired Company, such Indemnified Party
shall further take commercially reasonable measures to attempt to recover any
insurance proceeds available to offset such Damages under insurance policies
maintained by the Acquired Companies (a) that are in effect at the Effective
Time and remain in full force and effect immediately after the Effective Time
and (b) for which all premiums have been fully paid prior to the Effective
Time through the time at which such Damages were incurred or are otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

covered by such policy; _provided_ that, nothing herein shall obligate such
Indemnified Party to seek to recover such insurance proceeds prior to seeking
indemnification under this _Article X_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but
subject to _Section 10.04(f)_, (a) in connection with an Exempt Claim, no
Person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for consequential, special,
indirect, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages, for diminution in value,
lost opportunity costs, lost prospective economic advantage or lost profits or
any damages measured by lost profits or a multiple of earnings, other than
punitive damages awarded to a third party in respect of a Third Party Claim
and (b) in connection with a Non-Exempt Claim, no Person shall be liable to or
otherwise responsible for punitive damages, other than punitive damages
awarded to a third party in respect of a Third Party Claim.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Payment of Damages_.

 



 

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of
the amount of any Damages payable to any Parent Indemnified Party in
accordance with this _Article X_, the Representative shall direct the Escrow
Agent to release to Parent, from the Escrow Account, the lesser of (i) the
amount of such Damages and (ii) the then remaining balance of the Escrow
Account, including any earnings thereon, it being understood that the Escrow
Account shall be (A) Parents sole and exclusive source of recovery with
respect to claims other than Exempt Claims (" _Non-Exempt Claims_ ") arising
under, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and that, following release in full of all amounts held in
the Escrow Account, the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
shall have no further liability hereunder in connection with such Non-Exempt
Claims and (B) subject to _Section 7.10(a)_, Parents first and primary
source of recovery prior to the release in full of all amounts held in the
Escrow Account with respect to Exempt Claims arising under, or otherwise in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Following the release in full of all amounts held in the Escrow Account
and solely with respect to Exempt Claims, and subject to limitations set forth
in _Section 10.04(d)_, no later than ten (10) Business Days following the
final determination of the amount of any Exempt Claims Damages payable to a
Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with this _Article X_, each Company
Stockholder and Participating Optionholder shall pay to Parent, in cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent, such Company Stockholders or Participating Optionholders
pro rata portion (based upon their respective Pre-Closing Percentages) of the
amount of such Exempt Claims Damages.

 



 

(c) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of
the amount of any Damages payable to a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party
in accordance with this _Article X_, Parent shall pay to the Representative
(for the benefit of the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
pro rata in accordance with their Pre-Closing Percentages as set forth on the
Final Allocation Schedule), in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Representative, the amount of
such Damages.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 10.12 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be treated by the Parties,
for federal Income Tax and other applicable Tax purposes, as an adjustment to
the cash proceeds received by the Company Stockholders and Participating
Optionholders in the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Release of Escrow_. On the Expiration Date, Parent and the
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to the Representative,
from the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the positive difference between
(i) the then remaining balance of the Escrow Account, including any earnings
thereon, _minus_ (ii) the amount of Damages for which a Parent Indemnified
Party has timely made a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.03_
and which claim has not then been finally determined in accordance with this
_Article X_, and the Representative shall disburse such released amount to
the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders pro rata in
accordance with their Pre-Closing Percentages as set forth on the Final
Allocation Schedule. In the event any portion of the Escrow Account is not
released to the Representative on the Expiration Date as a result of the
reduction in respect of clause (ii) foregoing, following the final
determination of any such outstanding claims and, as applicable, payment in
respect thereof, the Representative and Parent shall promptly, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days, direct the Escrow Agent to release to the
Representative, from the Escrow Account, any remaining amounts to be
distributed to the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders, and
the Representative shall disburse such released amount to the Company
Stockholders and Participating Optionholders pro rata in accordance with their
Pre-Closing Percentages as set forth on the Final Allocation Schedule.

Participating Optionholder.

 



 

(e) The Representative may at any time designate a replacement Representative

her or its approval of this Agreement, hereby consents to such replacement

a number of votes constituting at least a majority of the Pre-Closing
Percentage) within thirty (30) days after such death, disability or
dissolution, appoint a successor representative and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor
shall become the "Representative" for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) No bond shall be required of the Representative and the Representative
shall receive no compensation for its services. The Representative shall not
be liable to any Company Stockholder or Participating Optionholder for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Representative while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of its reasonable business judgment with respect to any matter
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith), and
shall further not be liable to Parent or the Acquired Companies for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Representative absent bad faith or fraud on the
part of the Representative. The Representative shall be entitled to be
indemnified by the Company Stockholders and Participating Optionholders,
severally and not jointly, in accordance with such Persons Pre-Closing
Percentage, for any loss, liability or expense incurred on the part of the
Representative with respect to any matter arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder. The Representative
shall be entitled to recover from each Company Stockholder and Participating
Optionholder, severally and not jointly, in accordance with such Persons Pre-
Closing Percentage, any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by the Representative in good faith in connection with actions taken by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including
the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs), and
may offset any amounts received on behalf of such Persons pursuant to _Section
3.04(b)_ and _Section 10.11(c)_ in order to satisfy such payment obligations.
