AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 10, 2008, among Takeda America Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation (" _Parent_ "), Mahogany Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 _Introduction_

  

 The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each share of Company Common Stock, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $25.00 (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes (as provided in Section 2.7(g)), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Following consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

  

 Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain of the Company\'s directors and executive officers are entering into a Tender and Support Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ (the _"Tender and Support Agreement"_ ). 

   

 In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer._

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence the Offer, within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase, accept for payment, and pay for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the _"Offer Conditions"_ ). 

  

 (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, all of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial expiration date or      
  

such other date for one or more periods, until the earlier to occur of (i) a
date as of which all of the Offer Conditions, including the Minimum Tender
Condition, are satisfied or waived and (ii) the Walk Away Date; _provided_
that any such extension shall be in increments determined by Merger Sub of not
more than ten (10) Business Days, and in no event shall the Offer extend
beyond the Walk Away Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by any other Law.
The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such
expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Article 8\. Nothing in this Section 1.1(b) shall affect any termination
rights in Article 8; and in the event of any conflict between the provisions
of this Section 1.1(b) and Article 8, Article 8 shall be controlling.

  

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable following the later of: (i) the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. 

   

 (d) Merger Sub may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") following the Acceptance Time if at the commencement of any Subsequent Offering Period (or extension thereof) the number of Shares owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries (including any Shares beneficially owned by any of the foregoing) represent less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares. If immediately following the Acceptance Time, Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries own more than 80% but less than 90% of the Shares outstanding at that time (which shall include (i) shares beneficially owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, which Shares shall be converted into direct ownership at or prior to the expiration of the Offer by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (ii) shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn), to the extent requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall provide for a Subsequent Offering Period of at least ten (10) Business Days; _provided, however,_ that Merger Sub shall not be required to provide for such Subsequent Offering Period if the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option would, after giving effect to such exercise and when added to the number of Shares so owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, represent not less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as promptly as practicable after any such Shares are tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; 

  

 (vi) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of Shares or that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions; or

The Company and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company and its counsel copies of any written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and shall provide the Company with copies of all written responses and telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of Parent or Merger Sub or their counsel. 

  

 (g) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, except that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) following such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this 

        
  

Agreement prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall
promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to

The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of a statement in the Offer Documents that to the Knowledge of the Company all directors and executive officers of the Company intend to tender all of their respective Shares, if they hold any, in the Offer. 

   

 (b) Contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer, if practicable, and otherwise reasonably promptly thereafter (it being agreed that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make such filing no later than one (1) Business Day, and shall in any event make such filing within two (2) Business Days, of the commencement of the Offer), the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws, to the holders of Shares.

The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company\'s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the Company makes no covenant, agreement, representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent necessary such that the Schedule 14D-9 does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 (A) Parent and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares.

Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or under their control. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Directors._

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company at such time, promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, Shares pursuant to the Offer satisfying the Minimum Tender Condition (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and as long as Parent directly or indirectly beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding Shares, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) the number of Shares owned by Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of Shares that are issued and outstanding. The Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause such persons designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (I) each committee of the Company Board, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws and the Nasdaq rules, and (II) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and each committee of such board of directors (or similar body); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Sub\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not also officers of the Company (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); and _provided further_ that, in such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the Company Board shall cause the Person designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy, and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two (2) Persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the request of Merger Sub, use its reasonable best efforts to either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Merger Sub\'s 

        
  

designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above,
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions
available to the Company to cause the Merger Sub\'s designees to be so
elected or appointed.

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder and to the then applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to the Company\'s stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9, as contemplated by Section 1.2(b)) as is necessary to fulfill the Company\'s obligations under Section 1.3(a); _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall have timely supplied to the Company in writing, and shall be solely responsible for, any information with respect to Parent, Merger Sub and such designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Sub\'s designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, the approval by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one or two Continuing Directors then in office, all of such Continuing Directors then in office) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall (A) not be effective unless there is in office at least one (1) Continuing Director and (B) constitute the authorization of the Company Board, and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Company\'s rights under this Agreement, (iv) any waiver of any condition to the Company\'s obligations hereunder, (v) any amendment to the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (vi) any authorization of any agreement between the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or (vii) the taking of any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, other than the Company\'s performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including the consummation of the Merger, and other actions that would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates). The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Option to Acquire Additional Shares._ The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable in accordance with this Section 1.4, to purchase the number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the number of Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub in whole but not in part; _provided, however_ , that Merger Sub agrees that it will exercise the Top-Up Option if doing so would allow it to consummate the Merger pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL. In no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Company\'s then authorized and unissued Shares (including as authorized and 

        
  

unissued shares of Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any Shares
held in the treasury of the Company and any Shares reserved for issuance,
other than any Shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes,
upon the exercise of any outstanding Option or delivery of any restricted
stock unit or with respect to any other outstanding security convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares). The Top-Up Option may be
exercised by Merger Sub at any time at or after the Acceptance Time and the
expiration of any subsequent offering period and on or prior to the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the later of (i) the expiration date of the Offer or
(ii) the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless
waived by the Company, that (A) no provision of any applicable Law, and no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
judgment or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect
of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares
owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that
will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, and (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser covenants to
cause the Closing to occur within two (2) Business Days after the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-
Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable
Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of
the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub wishes to
so exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written
notice thereof specifying a place and time (which, subject to applicable Law
and any required regulatory approvals, shall be at least two (2), but not
more than five (5), Business Days after the date of delivery of such written
notice) for the closing of such purchase. At such closing, (i) the purchase
price in respect of the Top-Up Option Shares purchased upon such exercise of
the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the product of (x) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (y) the Offer
Price) shall be paid to the Company, at Merger Sub\'s election, either (A) in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option Shares and by delivering Parent\'s
unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory note in the principal
amount of the balance of such purchase price, which promissory note shall
bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date thereof and may be prepaid in whole or in part
without premium or penalty, and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a
certificate or certificates representing the number of Top-Up Option Shares so
purchased. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 Section 2.4 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.5 _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares the following shall occur:

As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7, without interest. 

  

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Ultimate Parent, Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , the provisions of this Section 2.5(c) are not authority for the Company to take any action referenced in Section 5.1(b), and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of Section 5.1(b) and this Section 2.5(c), the provisions of Section 5.1(b) shall be controlling. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a). The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent 

        
  

pursuant to Section 2.7(a) to pay for Shares that are instead paid fair value
in an appraisal proceeding pursuant to Section 262 shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.

  

 Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates._

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.7. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available); _provided_ , _further_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parent\'s obligation under this Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by Book-Entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to such holder, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to the Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an Employment Agreement) whose employment is terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances under which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the Company\'s severance practices (the " _Company Severance Practices_ "), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits from the 

        
  

Surviving Corporation that are equal to the severance benefits that would
have been paid under the Company Severance Practices as in existence on the
date of this Agreement, a copy of (or summary of or guidelines of) each of
which has been made available to Parent.

 (a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall afford, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford, the officers, employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable written notice and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' officers, employees, properties, facilities, books, records, correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), contracts and other assets as Parent shall reasonably request, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities laws with respect to matters unrelated to the Transactions and (ii) all other information concerning its and the Company Subsidiaries\' business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as Parent through its officers, employees or agents may reasonably request, (B) that are in the possession, custody or control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (C) the disclosure of which would not violate any Law, cause to be waived the attorney-client privilege or other similar privilege with respect to any material matter ( _provided_ that such privilege cannot in the Company\'s good faith judgment be reasonably sufficiently protected using a joint defense or other similar agreement), result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and agents will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect the Company\'s representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. 

       

           

    

  (b) Until the Effective Time, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 20, 2008 between Parent and the

 (a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly request that all such Persons with whom the Company had discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal during the prior year return or destroy all copies of confidential information previously provided to such parties by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Representatives to the extent any confidentiality agreement with such Person so provides or allows. Nothing in this Section 6.8(a) shall in any way limit or modify any of the Company\'s rights under the other provisions of this Section 6.8. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.8, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement, agreement-in-principle or letter of intent providing for or accept any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company may refer any third party to this Section 6.8 and (B) if in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.8, and subject to compliance with Section 6.8(c), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (but in no event after such time) do any or all of the following: (X) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives, but only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive with respect to confidentiality of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement shall contain additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of Section 6.8(c)), _provided_ that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) concurrently with its delivery to such Person, the Company delivers or makes available to Parent all such information not previously provided to Parent; (Y) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations (including the solicitation of revised Takeover Proposals) with such Person and its Representatives and its potential financing sources regarding such Takeover Proposal or (Z) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock with any such Person. The Company shall be deemed to be in breach of the provisions of this Section 6.8 upon the breach of any such provisions by the Company Subsidiaries or the Company\'s Representatives. 

  

 (c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the earliest to occur of (i) one (1) Business Day after receipt, (ii) 48 hours after receipt and (iii) 24 hours after actual receipt by any of the individuals listed in Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, advise Parent orally and in writing of the Company\'s receipt of any written Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such Takeover Proposal), 

        
  

and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal (and
the Company shall provide or make available to Parent copies of any
additional material documents regarding such Takeover Proposal received by the
Company from the Person making such Takeover Proposal or such Person\'s
Representatives).

  

 (d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.8, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, the Board Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer after ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer shall be considered an adverse modification) (any action described in clause (i) or (ii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company or the Company Board may, prior to the Acceptance Time (A) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the Board Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.8, (C) take any action in connection with the Rights Agreement or Section 203 of the DGCL to make the provisions of such agreement or statute inapplicable to a Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.8, or (D) enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if, in any such case, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 6.8 or in Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if in each case under this clause (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company Board or other committee thereof take any action prohibited by Section 6.8(d) except as permitted by the terms of Section 6.8(d). 

  

 Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance._

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, accurate and complete copies of which have been provided or made available to Parent, shall survive the Merger. From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as 

        
  

such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of
this Agreement and the Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, and shall advance each Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor for any reasonable legal or
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments or fines as such expenses are incurred, but subject
to the Indemnifying Parties\' receipt of an unsecured undertaking, to the
extent required by the DGCL, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay
such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall impair any rights to indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred
to in clause (a) above.

  

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, cause the individuals who have served as officers and directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has been delivered or made available to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_"), to be covered under a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such individuals than the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions of such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions) in their capacities as such, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; _provided,_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six-year (6) period as much coverage as is available for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting Tail Endorsement," _provided_  that the Company does not pay more than six (6) times the Maximum Amount for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, _provided_ that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, Parent shall be relieved from its obligations under this Section 6.9(c). 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. 

  

 (e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9). Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.9. 

         

 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.8 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-10(d)._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation and Talent Committee) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each employment compensation, severance and employee benefit agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Convertible Notes._

  

 (a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, or shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, dated as of November 15, 2006, relating to the Notes (the " _Indenture_ "), to the trustee under the Indenture and to each Holder (as defined in the Indenture), any notices required by the Indenture (including those notices that may be required pursuant to Section 3.01, Section 10.01, Section 10.12, Section 10.16, and Section 10.17 thereof, in each case to the extent applicable) in connection with the Transactions. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, on the Closing Date, execute such supplemental indenture to the Indenture as may be required under the Indenture (including under Section 9.01 or Section 10.12 thereof, in each case to the extent applicable) in connection with the Transactions. 

  

 (c) The Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such further actions, including the delivery of any officers\' certificates and opinions of counsel required by the Indenture (including by Section 5.01, Section 7.02, Section 9.04, Section 10.12 and Section 12.05 thereof, in each case to the extent applicable) as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Indenture in connection with the Transactions. 

  

 Section 6.13 _State Takeover Laws._ If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to any Transaction, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on such Transaction.

 (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d);

 (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the fees described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement described in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 8.2 (other than in connection with any termination under Section 8.1(f), for which the Termination Fee payable under Section 8.3(b)(iv) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub), but otherwise shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Amendment._ Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or stockholders of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such adoption by the holders of Shares, no amendment shall be made that, by applicable Law, requires further approval of such stockholders, without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or

behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time
for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or
noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than
that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

 Section 8.6 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Merger Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the approval contemplated by Section 1.3).

Such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it

 Section 9.11 _Disclosure Letter._ The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 2. Furthermore, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Sub\'s obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may, subject to the provisions of the Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions of the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Shares, if at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the expiration of the Offer, any of the following shall have occurred and be continuing unless, if any of the following have occurred and are continuing, they shall have resulted from the breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their obligations under the Agreement: 

  

  

 (a) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the effect of prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions; _provided_ , that in no event shall this condition be satisfied, and neither the Offer nor the Merger shall be consummated, if a Japanese court or other Japanese Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or permanent) to Ultimate Parent, the representative director of Ultimate Parent, all or a part of the directors of Ultimate Parent or the Chief Executive Officer of Ultimate Parent, directing any of them to not consummate, or to not allow 

  

      

  

Parent or Merger Sub to consummate, the Offer or the Merger, or making
illegal, or restraining or preventing, any of such consummation, and,

reasonable best efforts to oppose any such order, executive order, stay,
decree, judgment or injunction or to have such order, executive order, stay,
decree, judgment or injunction vacated or made inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions;

  

 (b) (i) any of the Company\'s representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.2(a), (c) and (f), Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(b)(i), Section 3.19 or Section 3.21 of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects or (ii) any of the Company\'s other representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement that (A) are not made as of a specific date are not true and correct as of the Acceptance Time, or (B) are made as of a specific date are not true and correct as of such date, in each case, except where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations and warranties, other than the representation set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.6), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (c) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any material covenant or material obligation required to be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time; 

  

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub shall not have received a certificate executed by the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer confirming on behalf of the Company that the conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of paragraph (2) of this _Annex A_ are duly satisfied immediately prior to the Acceptance Time; or 

  

 (e) the Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement. 

  

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived only by Parent or Merger Sub, and then, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub (except for any condition that, pursuant to Section 1.1(e) of the Agreement, may only be waived with the Company\'s consent). The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment. 

  

 SEVENTH: 

  

 1. _ Action, Suits and Proceedings Other Than by or in the Right of the Corporation._ The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an 

        
  

"Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees)
judgment, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which
he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article, except as set forth in Section 6
below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

  

 2. _ Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation._ The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys\' fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 

  

 3. _ Indemnification for Expenses Of Successful Party._ Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

  

 4. _ Notification and Defense of Claim._ As a condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its 

        
  

own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.
After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to
assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4\.
The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection
with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be
at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the
Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the
Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled,
without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any
claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel
for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in
clause (ii) above.

   

 5. _ Advance of Expenses._ Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such repayment. 

  

 6. _ Procedure for Indemnification._ In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a) a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), (b) if no such quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (c) independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the Corporation), or (d) a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 7. _ Remedies._ The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in Section 6\. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of 

        
  

such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the
Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. The Indemnitee\'s expenses (including attorneys\' fees)
incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the Corporation.

  

 8. _ Subsequent Amendment._ No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 

   

 9. _ Other Rights._ The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article. 

  

 10. _ Partial Indemnification._ If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal, therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled. 

  

 11. _ Insurance._ The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation law of Delaware. 

  

 12. _ Merger or Consolidation._ If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation. 

   

 13. _ Savings Clause._ If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys\' fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, 

        
  

including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have
been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  

 14. _ Definitions._ Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i). 

  

 15. _ Subsequent Legislation._ If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended.
