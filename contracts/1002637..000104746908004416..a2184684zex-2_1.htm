<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), dated as of April&nbsp;10, 2008, among Takeda America
Holdings,&nbsp;Inc., a New York corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), Mahogany Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger Sub</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and Millennium Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER" style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Introduction  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Common
Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") issued and outstanding (each share of Company Common Stock, a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Share</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and, collectively, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), at a price per Share of $25.00 (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), subject to any required withholding of Taxes (as provided in Section&nbsp;2.7(g)), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>DGCL</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in
Section&nbsp;2.5(b) and Section&nbsp;2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain of the
Company's directors and executive officers are entering into a Tender and Support Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub substantially in the form attached as </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the </FONT><FONT

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than five
(5)&nbsp;Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence the Offer, within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase, accept for payment, and pay for,
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Annex&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>"Offer Conditions"</I></FONT><FONT

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20<SUP>th</SUP>) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act
Rules&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, all
of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial expiration date or </FONT></P>

any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by any other Law. The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article&nbsp;8. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;1.1(b) shall affect any termination rights in Article&nbsp;8; and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.1(b)
and Article&nbsp;8, Article&nbsp;8 shall be controlling. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase

practicable following the later of: (i)&nbsp;the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and
(ii)&nbsp;the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger

Subsequent Offering Period (or extension thereof) the number of Shares owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries (including any Shares beneficially owned by any of
the foregoing) represent less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares. If immediately following the Acceptance Time, Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries own
more than 80% but less than 90% of the Shares outstanding at that time (which shall include (i)&nbsp;shares beneficially owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries, which Shares shall be converted into direct ownership at or prior to the expiration of the Offer by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, and (ii)&nbsp;shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn), to the extent requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall provide for a Subsequent Offering Period of at least ten
(10)&nbsp;Business Days; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that Merger Sub shall not be required to provide for such Subsequent Offering Period if the number of
Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option would, after giving effect to such exercise and when added to the number of Shares so owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Subsidiaries, represent not less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as promptly as practicable after any such
Shares are tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. </FONT></P>
